        "document": "By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:33 EST, 6 June 2013 . An Australian comedy group has been labelled 'repulsive' after posting a prank video on YouTube featuring one of its members performing a lewd act next to a baby. Melbourne-based The Janoskians have faced widespread criticism over the video which features members of the group masturbating in public and shows one member telling a six-week-old child's mother that her 'baby is sexy'. Among those to criticise the controversial video is Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas who took to Twitter today to condemn the group as 'school bullies'. Controversial: The Janoskians, pictured arriving at Heathrow Airport earlier this year, have been criticised for their 'repulsive new video prank . Bad taste: The prank sees the group pretending to masturbate in public with one scene featuring one member of the group telling a mother that her six month old baby is 'sexy' He posted: 'The social purpose of comedy, as well as being entertainment, is to push the envelope and test boundaries. 'When an established act like me publicly criticises a new act, it can look like sour grapes. But I don't care. I think someone needs to say something.' He added: 'Am I too old to \"get it\"? Maybe I am. If so, I'm glad. It's repulsive. It's probably also criminal. It's certainly utterly witless. 'The @janoskians may think they're brave and edgy. They're not. They're just school bullies. 'I hope they see sense and take the clip down.' Criticism: Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas sparked a Twitter storm after calling a new comedy video 'repulsive' Lucas' comments sparked debate on Twitter with many agreeing with the former Shooting Stars comedian while others branded him a hypocrite referencing some of his near the mark portrayals of homosexuals and disabled people. Samia Islam tweeted: 'That new Janoskians video is absolutely disgucting and horrible.' Another user called @Jonas_Starkid added: @janoskians you guys disgust me. You aren't funny, you're an embarrassment to Australia.' The video features members of the group performing a solo sex act under escalators, in shopping centres and at bus stops. But the controversy seemed to leave The Janoskians undeterred however. The group posted on their own Twitter page today: 'The hole purpose of Public W*****g is to see the unseen reactions (sic). 'It's never been done before and it's interesting to see reactions. 'For the people who think we took it too far have really closed minds about the subject (sic). 'It was acting and if you couldn't tell, we weren't really w*****g. Not only (that) the baby would never understand what's going on. 'The hole purpose was to see the mother's reaction. And it was good. Definitely our favourite video (sic).' Hitting out: Little Britain star Matt Lucas expressed his disgust at the group's latest video . Jai Brooks, a member of the group, even tweeted Matt Lucas to thank him for the publicity his comments had stirred up. He said: Thanks for taking out your time for us and writing a whole page essay on us and promoting our 'disgusting video'.' The group gained millions of fans when they began posting videos of their antics on YouTube. They are currently on a world tour.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Four days after an al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for targeting an oil tanker, the United Arab Emirates government has acknowledged that it was indeed attacked, state media said Friday. The government had earlier said the tanker was passing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was exposed to a high wave as a result of an earthquake shock. However, the state news agency WAM reported, the tanker \"was the target of a terrorist attack while passing through international waters near the Strait of Hormuz.\" Workers fixed the damage to the vessel and the attack caused no human injuries or oil spills, the agency said. The militant Islamist group claimed responsibility for the explosion aboard the oil tanker on Monday. In a statement posted on various websites that regularly carry messages from al Qaeda leaders, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades included a picture of a man they claimed carried out a suicide attack on the tanker on July 28. The group said the attack was intended to \"strike an economic blow to the infidels.\" It is believed to be behind several attacks in the Middle East, including the October 2004 attack on a hotel and nearby camp sites in Egypt that killed more than three dozen people. The statement from the Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the tanker was the \"conquest of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman\" -- a reference to the imprisoned blind cleric who inspired the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.",

        "document": "Tragic loss: Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, of New Market, Md., died of asphyxia on January 12, 2013, after three Frederick County Sheriff's deputies tried to forcibly remove him from a movie theater at the manager's request . A health aide to a man with Down syndrome who died after being dragged from a Maryland theater had warned police that he would ‘freak out’ if they touched or spoke to him, according to an investigative file released Monday. Robert ‘Ethan’ Saylor, 26, passed away from asphyxia minutes later, after three Frederick County Sheriff's deputies handcuffed the flailing, 294-pound man as he screamed, cursed and cried for his mother, witnesses say. Saylor's offense, according to the file documents: He had not purchased a ticket for a repeat viewing of the movie Zero Dark Thirty. The 98-page incident report and handwritten statements from 22 witnesses add new details to a case that remains in the spotlight six months after Saylor's death on January 12. Critics continue to call for an independent investigation of the deputies' actions after a grand jury's decision in March not to indict them for what the state medical examiner's office has ruled a homicide. The 18-year-old caretaker, whose name is redacted from the documents, wrote that she had been Saylor's aide for three months before he died. She said Saylor, known to his family as Ethan, had a history of angry outbursts, including one earlier that night. They had already seen the movie once and were outside the Frederick theater when she asked Saylor if he was ready to go home. Saylor began cursing and punched a Lenscrafters storefront window, she told police. Somewhat frightened, the caretaker called Saylor's mother, 55-year-old Patti Saylor, of New Market. ‘Patti told her to just wait him out and his attitude will change,’ an investigator wrote in a follow-up interview report. No charges: A grand jury ruled in March that the three Maryland Sheriff's deputies involved in the death of Ethan Saylor, left, at a Westview movie theater, right, will not face criminal charges . The caretaker then spoke by phone with . another of Saylor's caretakers. He advised her to leave Saylor in front . of the theater while she got the car, giving him a few minutes alone to . calm himself. But by the . time she returned, Saylor had gone back into the theater and seated . himself. As she walked in, the manager of the cinema was telling Saylor . he had to either purchase a ticket to watch the film again, or leave the . auditorium. In response, the 26-year-old man said he had no money for another viewing. ‘I . explained, “Yes, we are having a little issue, I'll handle it. We just . have to be patient,\"’ the caretaker wrote in her statement. The . manager then summoned one of the three deputies, Sgt. Rich Rochford. All of the deputies were moonlighting as mall security officers. ‘Then . a sheriff came and said, “Another show is starting. I have to go get . him out,\"’ the caretaker wrote. ‘I explained Ethan is Down syndrome.’ She said she told the officer that if he spoke to Saylor, ‘he will curse.’ She advised him to ‘wait it out.’ Full life: With an IQ of 40, Ethan loved music, idolized law enforcement and was encouraged by his family to be independent . Justice for Ethan: The 26-year-old man's family, including brother Adam (left) and sister Emma (right), are calling for an independent probe into their sibling's untimely death . ‘Then the sheriff went in and started talking to Ethan and Ethan was cursing at him,’ the woman stated. She said the officer threatened to take Mr Saylor to jail, a statement corroborated by other witnesses. ‘I . then said, “Please don't touch him, he will freak out,\"’ the aide . wrote. ‘Next thing I know, there are I think three or four cops holding . Ethan, trying to put him in handcuffs.’ As the officers pulled the struggling Saylor from his seat and down an exit ramp, they went down out of view of most witnesses. One . customer told police an officer had his knee on Saylor's lower back . while the other deputies held Saylor's shoulders. At least two witnesses . said the kneeling officer's knee was on the floor. Nobody reported . seeing the officers touch Saylor's neck. 'Mommy!' a witness later reported hearing Saylor cry out while struggling with the deputies. ‘It hurt [sic], call my mom.' Another . witness wrote in his statement that the 26-year-old could be heard . ‘squalling’ and repeatedly saying ‘no’ as the officers wrestled with . him, one of them even reading him his Miranda rights, the Washington Post reported. Neither . Saylor nor his 18-year-old health aide knew that Patti Saylor was just . five minutes away from the theater. But she arrived too late. Witness accounts: Theater goers who were present during the incident reported hearing Ethan cry for his mother and struggle with the officers . Saylor . became unconscious, so the deputies rolled him over, by all accounts. The deputies couldn't find a pulse, so they removed the handcuffs and . started chest compressions until he started breathing again, snoring but . unconscious, according to all accounts. They asked the caretaker if she could wake him. ‘I tapped him and said, “Wake up, Ethan,\"’ she wrote. Mr Saylor never regained consciousness, despite the efforts of ambulance workers who arrived soon afterward. The . state medical examiner's office found signs of ‘positional’ asphyxia, . or having been in a position in which he couldn't breathe. There was . also unexplained damage to Saylor's larynx. The . autopsy concluded Saylor would not have died had the officers not . intervened. The autopsy also found that Saylor's developmental . disability, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a heart . abnormality contributed to the death. According . to Ethan's mother and siblings, 21-year-old brother Adam and . 23-year-old sister Emma, the 26-year-old idolized law enforcement and . amassed a large collection of badges and baseball caps with words like . 'police' and 'sheriff' emblazoned across the front. Despite . having an IQ of 40, his mother, a nurse with special education degree, . had always encouraged Ethan to be independent and go places with his . aides. In a message posted Wednesday on the Facebook account Justice for Ethan, Patti Saylor wrote that even as her son was . being dragged to his death by police, he was on his cell phone trying to . arrange for a movie ticket purchase or for someone to bring him . money. Music-lover: Robert Saylor pictured with a relative was a big music fan and a member of his church choir .

Nick Clegg was humiliated as his party came in fifth place – only 300 votes ahead of Charlotte Rose, a former ‘sex worker of the year’ who stood as an independent. The Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby received just 349 votes, with the party losing its deposit for the eighth time since 2010. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem candidate Geoff Juby managed to narrowly defeated former 'sex worker of the year' Charlotte Rose . With only 0.9 per cent of the ballots cast in Rochester and Strood, the result raises fears of a Lib Dem meltdown in next year’s election. In 2010, the Liberal Democrats won 7,800 votes in the constituency – 16.3 per cent of the total – to come third after the Conservatives and Labour. On Thursday, the party came behind Ukip, the Tories, Labour and the Greens – although it did manage to beat Hairy Knorm Davidson, of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, and Miss Rose. Dominatrix Miss Rose, a friend of former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men. Miss Rose called for more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry and also defeated the Liberal Democrat candidate Geoff Juby . Miss Rose, a friend of former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, claims to have slept with more than 1,000 men . She received 43 votes for policies including more sex education in schools, ‘sexual equality’ for the elderly and disabled, and the legalisation of the sex industry. Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron yesterday said the party had found itself in ‘a really funny electoral situation’. He added: ‘When I went knocking on doors in Rochester I found amongst the people I spoke to plenty of Lib Dems who took the interesting view to tactically vote Conservative to try and beat Ukip. ‘My assumption is more Lib Dem and Labour voters voted Tory than there were Tories voting Tory, as they all seemed to vote Ukip. It’s a peculiar situation that all of us will take some time to take stock of. ‘Next May we won’t see a majority government from any party, in which case we need to think about what kind of government we want – one in hock to extremist nationalists, or including Lib Dems who are moderate, sensible and helped to get the economy back on track.’ Candidates lose their deposit if they score less than 5 per cent of the vote – a major humiliation for a party of government. The previous record for the lowest share for a major party in a by-election was set by the Liberal hopeful in the Glasgow Camlachie vote of 1948, who received 1.2 per cent of the vote. The Lib Dems had traditionally done well in by-elections, but it has a dismal record since going into Coalition – with the exception of the poll in Eastleigh, which they held.",

        "document": "By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 20:57 EST, 22 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 23 September 2013 . When Sharron Kahn Luttrell first signed up to do her bit for the community by helping to train service dogs, she had little idea what an effect it would have on her life and how it would challenge her preconceptions. Training Neads puppy Daisy was literally no walk in the park. Instead every weekend, the Massachusetts mother-of-two found herself in the company of her co-trainer Keith - an inmate sent to prison for 40 years when he was 16 - just a few months older than Luttrell's own daughter. To her - and his - surprise they developed a deep and lasting friendship as they bonded over Daisy. Swapping notes and tips in the prison waiting room, Luttrell soon realized this adorable Labrador had the power to change all of their lives. Her experiences make up the heart-warming memoir Weekends With Daisy, which is currently being developed into a film by CBS Films. In training: Sharron and son Josh introduce Daisy to the sights and sounds of a busy street . Life changing: Sharron Luttrell helped a prisoner named Keith train service dog Daisy . ‘Keith had never taken care of anything. He says he was a selfish kid but you can’t be that way with a puppy,' Luttrell, who has helped train three dogs with him, told MailOnline. 'You have to control your reactions and emotions. When he goes out into . society he will take those qualities with him.' It wasn't just Keith who was helped by Daisy. The cute puppy, the color of butterscotch, also taught Luttrell important lessons about patience, perseverance and the ability to judge a person based on their current actions rather than their past. It was a chance encounter with a service dog at a grocery store that first let to the unlikely alliance between Luttrell and Keith. There she had met another Neads trainer who told her about the program and it seemed the perfect solution to her growing 'empty nest' anxiety. When she first heard of the National Education for Assistance Dog Services program Luttrell had been at a . crossroads in her life, with her two children fast growing up and . needing her less leaving her feeling 'isolated and lost'. The . Neads program, which uses inmates to intensively train service dogs, . gave Luttrell the new focus she was looking for. Dedication: Keith worked hard teaching Daisy commands and tricks, such as 'say your prayers' Work out: Inmates train with their puppies in the prison yard . When she first met Keith at a medium security facility in Rhode Island, Luttrell thought her only challenge would be solving those early puppy problems common to anyone with a young dog. Luttrell found herself turning to Keith for advice, but she had no idea what he had done to be behind bars. At first the obvious elephant in the room was not addressed and the Neads program limits interaction between inmates and weekend puppy raisers. But curiosity got the better of Luttrell - she was a former reporter, after all. More... Mother claims South Carolina school TURNED AWAY her autistic 4-year-old daughter, service dog . Hay there! Hilarious moment grinning horse photo-bombs picture (and other pets get in on the craze too proving no picture is safe) She learned his last name and gasped when she read court documents laying out in clinical detail the shocking nature of his brutal crime. A crime described by the judge as an ‘exhibition of human savagery at its worst’. Keith had been sentenced to a 40-year sentence for accessory to murder when he was 16, after beating a man, who was then shot dead by his friend. ‘Keith was no longer a generic, gentle inmate who trained puppies … he was someone capable of taking another’s life without a thought,’ she said. However, their shared goal of helping Daisy and the person who would one day rely on the dog helped Luttrell overcome her feelings of terror and disgust at Keith's crime. 'For Daisy's sake, for Keith's, for . mine, and for the person out there who would eventually rely on Daisy, I . had to drop the ugliness of Keith's past', she said. She added: ‘[Keith’s] grown tremendously. There’s no good outlet to grow in prison. The puppy program is . something meaningful in that place. It gave him confidence.’ Part of the family: Daisy with Luttrell's children Aviva and Joshua . Here to help: Daisy, at the front, with other Neads service dogs . The puppy program helps inmates as much as the disabled people who eventually become paired up with the dogs. Luttrell said that another inmate she trains with told her that before joining the program everyone told him he was ‘a piece of s***’ and he felt that way too ‘but now he has a different definition’. Despite her bond with Keith, Luttrell says finding out the background to her inmate co-trainers still remains difficult. Her emotions were tested again when, by chance, she discovered the new inmate she was working with had been Keith’s co-defendant – the man who had pulled the trigger on that fateful night. ‘My blood went cold,’ she said, as she recalled how a prison guard had read out his full name, which identified him. Socialized: The job of the weekend puppy raisers is to expose the dogs to new experiences, such as train rides . Helping hand: Daisy picks up a discarded mitten - a trick she was taught by Keith and Sharron . Knowing the co-trainers have committed horrendous crimes is something the mother struggles with. She said the only way she copes with it is by focusing on how Keith and his co-defendant had been teenagers at the time. Neads - the National Education for Assistance Dog Services - is a training progam that teaches puppies to become service dogs. Neads uses a variety of breeds, from Labradors and poodles to collies and labradoodles. The dogs are trained by inmates, who then hand their puppies to volunteer trainers at weekends so they can get used to the noises, sights and sounds of the outside world. Training begins when the puppies are eight weeks old, and takes about 18 months to complete. It costs $25,000 to fully train and pair one of the service dogs with the individual they are matched to. The training is vigorous but Neads has a long waiting list of people willing to adopt the dogs that don't graduate. ‘They’re so foolish [at that age]’ she said. ‘So impulsive, not operating at full capacity. But that said, you just don’t go around killing people.’ Captain Lefebvre, who helps oversee the prison program, has also witnessed the change in inmates involved in the training. He told Luttrell the ‘best trainers are those who consider their work a chance to redeem themselves’. ‘They know they can’t make up for the damage they did … but they can chip away at it.’ For Luttrell, who has now helped train seven puppies, the Neads progam opened the door to a new experience and, as an added bonus, her family gets to have a puppy on weekends. ‘We’re not looking for a dog,’ Luttrell said. ‘I don’t want to go through the end-of-life part again. It’s still too raw [after losing Tucker]’ She said three of the seven dogs she has worked with have 'flunked' the program but her current charge – Rescue – is with her for only one more weekend before graduating. Despite being in the program since 2008 the goodbyes never get easier.  ‘That final weekend I spend lots of time on the floor, snuggling,’ she said. Best friends: Daisy with David, the young boy she was placed with after graduating as a service dog . Luttrell always makes a photo album of her time with the dog to pass on to its new owner, who could be disabled, or need a balance dog, and also shares pictures with the inmate who helped co-train the dog. Daisy not only helped Luttrell focus and learn how to diffuse tensions with her teenage children, the adorable yellow Labrador also helped her see how dogs can transform the lives of the inmates who train them and the people they go on to serve. For Luttrell, she has found fulfillment and a new community and, while she admits she still feels frivolous walking into prison each weekend to pick up a puppy, the Neads program gives her a purpose and a way to reach out and help others.

In fact, unless you get him talking about the Atlanta Braves -- one of his true passions in life -- he is a very quiet person. Jeff Donohoo, 36, at work in the kitchen at Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Early on, his younger brothers and sister didn't know, either. \"Since they grew up with him, they just knew Jeff was Jeff,\" said Nancy Donohoo, his mother. \"They didn't think of him as weird or anything.\" But when friends started to notice Donohoo was different, Nancy Donohoo was quick to explain to a group of 10-year-olds why. \"Jeff has a social problem, not a mental problem,\" she explained. \"He's very smart. He reads encyclopedias ... he just doesn't know how to talk to people.\" From then on, friends who visited the house always made an effort to interact with Donohoo, through a high-five or a simple \"hello.\" Today, it's unlikely Donohoo will be the first to say hello in a group setting, but interacting with people is easier for him than it once was.  See how Donohoo copes every day » . Questioned about his childhood, his most elaborate response is \"yeah\" or \"no.\" But when the topic is the Braves, it's hard to get him to stop talking about the latest statistics or his favorite player, Mark Teixeira. Asked how long he's been a Braves fan, there was little hesitation: \"All my life.\" He's come a long way since he was a child. Then, just teaching Donohoo to talk was a challenge in itself, Nancy Donohoo said. \"There was no eye contact, so I would hold his face in front of me, and say the word I wanted him to say.\" Donohoo entered the first grade as a special education student. It was the first year special education was offered in his family's hometown of Florence, Alabama. He carried on with special education until the sixth grade, when he was mainstreamed, or put in classes with children without disabilities.  Explainer: Understanding autism » . For most of Donohoo's childhood, his mother had suspicions about his condition. \"When he was little, I had watched a 'Marcus Welby' show, and they had an autistic child on there. But he was very passive; he sat in the corner and just hit things,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"Jeff was wild. He was the opposite, so I just assumed he couldn't be autistic. But he had a lot of those mannerisms.\" It was Donohoo's freshman year of high school when Nancy and Bill Donohoo learned what was wrong with their son. \"There was a doctor in Huntsville that dealt a lot with hyperactive children,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"He said, 'I'm going to give you this sheet of paper; these are all the symptoms of autism.' \" The list had 19 symptoms, and Nancy Donohoo was instructed to circle the ones her son had. She circled 17. The diagnosis didn't change how Nancy Donohoo dealt with her first-born son. In fact, the doctor said she already was doing all the right things, working to socialize Donohoo. Today, Donohoo, living with his parents, finds comfort in strict routine. He wakes each day at 5 a.m. to make himself breakfast and prepare for work. At 6, Nancy Donohoo drives her son to Memorial Hospital, where he's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria. Ollie Forté is Donohoo's supervisor, and has worked with Donohoo almost since the beginning. \"He's very valuable to us at this department. He's dependable, on time, no attendance problems,\" said Forté. \"We love Jeff.\" After work, at 2:30 p.m., Donohoo rides with his mother to the YMCA, where he works out for about three hours. Then it's back home, where he fixes himself dinner and spends hours online looking up Braves statistics, or reading a number of baseball-related books from his personal library. This cycle repeats on days Donohoo works at the hospital. On his days off, the schedule is equally strict, with little variation. He'll still go to the YMCA, and he'll also make the occasional trip to the bookstore, adding to his collection of baseball-related literature. Sudden changes to daily plans are still a challenge. \"If he's made his plans to do something tonight,\" said Bill Donohoo, \"and we come and say, 'We're going to get something to eat. Do you want to go?' that upsets his plans for what he's going to do that night.\" Physical contact is also difficult. \"He doesn't like to be touched,\" Nancy Donohoo said. \"He doesn't freak, but he doesn't like it. He stiffens up. He'll want to give you a hug, but he still has a hard time.\" The many challenges aside, Donohoo has a fine appreciation for things like cooking. In addition to preparing his own meals, he also enjoys baking. \"He loves desserts -- he loves sweets,\" Nancy Donohoo said with a laugh. \"He's a little heavy, but we're working on that.\" Nancy and Bill Donohoo have endured the challenges, and they acknowledge their son will never be fully independent. But one can tell they couldn't be prouder of him. \"It's rewarding today, because he's come so far, but it was a long road,\" Nancy Donohoo said. E-mail to a friend .",

        "document": "Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Gabby Giffords remembers facing her assailant at his sentencing. \"Beady eyes,\" she said of Jared Loughner, who shot the former Arizona congresswoman in the head with a 9mm Glock pistol. Six people died and 13 were injured that day when the deranged gunman opened fire in front of a Tucson supermarket. At the sentencing last November, Giffords sat stoically -- staring Loughner down -- as her husband, Mark Kelly, spoke to the court. \"Well, yes, he had some interesting expressions on his face,\" said Kelly. \"And she did not look away.\" \"Beady eyes,\" Giffords repeated. In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, Giffords and Kelly understand they are now in the center of the heated debate over gun control and background checks, while still struggling to rebuild their lives after that day in January 2011, when their lives changed forever. Old self, new challenges . What is most shocking about Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self. Her golden locks are back; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile. Gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery. Yet she knows she will never be the same. \"Stronger. Stronger, better, tougher. Stronger, better, tougher.\" That's how Giffords describes herself. Giffords makes that declaration with determination and gusto. But it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that, or anything else. 'Yes, it's tough': For Giffords, a wounded life has a new purpose . Being with Giffords, it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her. She follows conversation, reacts, engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means. As a result of her gunshot wound, Giffords suffers from a condition called aphasia, and that it is \"very difficult for her,\" said Kelly. Aphasia is an impairment to language-related functions, such as speaking, writing, listening and reading. At times, even simple words are a struggle, like when she tries to explain how she spends her days. \"Occupational therapy, yogurt,\" said Giffords. Kelly, a former astronaut, patiently and quietly corrects her, saying \"yoga.\" \"Yoga, yoga,\" Giffords repeats, offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said \"yogurt\" instead of \"yoga.\" Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed. She generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around. Her right leg is also paralyzed. She wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good, left leg to walk. Still, she walks remarkably well. But she doesn't see very well. \"Not great at all,\" is how she described her vision. Giffords has limited sight in both eyes with no peripheral vision to the right. In the same house as a family . For Kelly and Giffords, this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together. She was a bright young political rising star and he was with NASA. Kelly said it is \"different in a lot of good ways.\" The biggest difference? For the first time, they actually live in the same house, in the same city, in the same state. Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center. They had a commuter marriage, which didn't allow them much time together. Now, they are together all the time, living in a ranch-style home they bought last summer. Another difference? Before Giffords was shot, she had a rocky relationship with Kelly's two teenage daughters from a previous marriage. \"Yes, changed,\" says Giffords. \"Yes, a lot better,\" echoes Kelly. \"They've, well, they've also grown up a little bit, too. And, you know, as a family, we've evolved because of ... you know, because of what happened,\" said Kelly. \"So it's brought us all closer together,\" said Kelly. And, as parents, for Giffords and Kelly, thoughts return to her shooter, Loughner. \"So sad. Mentally ill,\" Giffords added. Newly-released court documents reveal that Loughner's parents suspected something was wrong - that he heard voices and exhibited other alarming behavior. \"As a parent, you know you can empathize with somebody who went thru that ... where their kid did this horrific thing. At the same time, you know, there were indications of his mental illness. You know, the school knew about it. His parents knew about it. And he didn't have -- didn't seem to have a lot of options for good treatment,\" said Kelly. In the past two years, Giffords and Kelly have not heard from Loughner's parents. Would they want to? \"Um, not really,\" said Giffords. Giffords suffered yet another tragedy a few months ago. Her father Spencer -- with whom she had a special bond -- died suddenly. He taught her a lot about humor, strength and responsibility, handing her the keys to his tire business when she was just 26. Giffords' grit and determination also comes from her mother, Gloria -- a force of nature. She is an artist whose home is in the middle of the desert, miles from civilization. Off-roading with Gabby . You have to go off-road to get there. There are so many desert rocks that on the way home, Kelly got a flat tire in the pitch black night. Giffords, the daughter of a tire salesman and expert tire changer in her own right, got out of the car to help. Giffords bond with mother, who sat by her hospital bed for countless hours and still plays a central role in her long road to recovery, is tighter than ever. And there may be a sliver of hope for Giffords, now 42, to have a child of her own. When she was shot, she was trying to get pregnant with fertility treatments. They still have two frozen embryos. But given Giffords injuries, they'd likely have to use a surrogate. \"I don't know,\" said Giffords, looking over at Kelly for his response. \"We -- you know, we talk about it. We talk about it. We haven't made a decision,\" said Kelly. Asked whether she is ever resentful about what happened to her, Giffords replied: . \"No. No.\" \"Move ahead. Move ahead,\" she said. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

        "document": "Boris Johnson last night launched a crowd-pleasing demand for a return to grammar schools. The London Mayor sought to boost his standing with the Tory faithful by announcing his ‘strong belief in competitive education’ and selective admissions. It is the first time in more than a decade that a Conservative heavyweight has advocated a return to selection. There was a scrum of TV crews, photographers, reporters and fans waiting for Boris Johnson at Birmingham New Street Station . The London Mayor's taxi was surrounded by photographers in scenes usually reserved for popstars and A list celebrities . Mr Johnson, who does not control the . capital’s schools, again hinted at his  prime ministerial ambitions by . saying he was not able to shape party policy in  education ‘yet’. He was given a rock star reception at the Birmingham conference. A crowd chanting ‘Boris, Boris, Boris’ gathered at New Street station when he arrived by train and he faced a scrum of delegates and media at the conference hotel. At a rally in his honour attended by around 1,000 grassroots Tories, Mr Johnson said: ‘I’m a strong believer in competitive education. What was the Olympics? It was a pageant of competition. We should be allowing children to compete academically. ‘I personally have no objections to selective admissions at some stage.’ He said ‘some people object’ to the 11 plus, which divides pupils at that age, but he said it should be possible to select at later ages. And in a clear hint that he wants a wider national role, Mr Johnson concluded: ‘As far as party policy is concerned I’m not in a position to do this – yet.’ Mr Johnson tonight received a standing ovation from hundreds of activists at a ConservativeHome fringe meeting . The Boris Johnson circus threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from Chancellor George Osborne . He also said he would continue to . speak out in favour of a new hub airport, an idea the Coalition has . punted into the long grass. His provocative intervention on . education may not please David Cameron, who decided against reopening . the grammar school debate back in 2007. Conference: Boris Johnson takes centre stage . But not everyone has been swept up in Boris-mania. Veteran minister Ken Clarke today said Mr Johnson had to grow up. 'If he really wants to be a . prime minister for serious reasons and not just getting his picture in . the paper more often, he really does have to settle down and demonstrate . he can seriously deliver on some complicated subjects,' he told a meeting hosted by . Channel 4 on the fringe of the conference. He added it would be 'disastrous' if Mr Johnson could not get the 'fashionable' speculation under control. Health minister Anna Soubry also played . down the idea that the public was gripped by Borismania: 'Not one person . in my constiuency ever has said anything to me about Boris.' But the Boris Johnson circus still threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson refused to say . if Mr Cameron was a better Prime Minister than he would be, insisting . the claim was ‘unverifiable’. And  the London Mayor used his . newspaper column to claim the government had left the 'struggling . middle' feeling 'utterly ignored. Last night he addressed hundreds of supporters at a rally organised by the ConservativeHome website under the triumphal banner 'Re-elected and Olympotastic'. He was careful to praise Mr Cameron, and said he was one of the first Tory MPs to back him as party leader. Boris Johnson battled through crowds and a media scrum to arrive at The Hyatt Hotel . Mr Johnson had to battle through camera crews at Birmingham New Street station (left) before being confronted by more cameras when he passed through security at the conference venue (right) The London Mayor said the Conservative party had to remain squarely on the centre ground and claim back the One Nation mantra from Ed Miliband. But he refused to rule out publicly challenging policy drawn up by the coalition. Mr Johnson said: ’Of course I am going to fight what I think might be ill-conceived Lib Dem plans for a mansion tax when I read about it. 'Of course I am I going to continue to lobby for a long overdue solution to our aviation capacity problems. The rise and rise of his old friend has given David Cameron plenty to think about while in the conference hall earlier today . 'No-one, as a result of that, should have any cause to doubt my admiration of David Cameron. 'He, George Osborne and the government are doing exactly what is needed to clean up the country and the mess Labour left.' But . in a direct challenge to Mr Cameron he warned against thinking a third . runway at Heathrow would solve Britain's aviation capacity crisis. 'I say to my friends who secretly think a third runway:you need to move away from that idea. 'None of these solutions is easy but we can't do is turn a blind eye to what is happening in other European countries.' And he raised the prospect of a return to grammar schools, an issue which threatened to destabilise Mr Cameron's leadership in 2007. 'I am a strong believer in competitive education,' Mr Johnson said. 'We should be able to allow children to compete academically in my view in that way. 'I personally have no objection to selective admissions at some stage in a child's development.' The success of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games on his watch has boosted Mr Johnson's popularity just as Mr Cameron's has waned. Mr Johnson joked: 'I sometimes think after the great success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is we need more things like it. What's next? The Politicians Olympics.' 'Jeremy Hunt would be wanging the bell end. Me for the zip wire, Seb Coe for the 800m, William Hague for the judo. 'And Ed Miliband for the high jump.' The remarkable scenes as Mr Johnson arrived in Birmingham contrast with the . low key arrival of Mr Cameron at the conference centre on Saturday and . confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as political box office. Asked if he was in Birmingham to make trouble for Prime Minister, Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm here to support the party.' He ignored further questions as he was chased through the hotel. Then today he will make a more traditional speech from the main conference stage. Mr . Cameron has been repeatedly forced to answer questions about the threat . to his leadership posed by his old schoolfriend from Eton. This week the PM said he 'was relaxed . about having the blond haired mop sounding off from time to time' after . Mr Johnson challenged him over Europe, aviation policy and tax. On . Sunday a a survey by pollsters Opinium for The Observer gave Mr Johnson . him a net +30 rating among voters, compared to -21 for the Prime . Minister. Asked if he was planning to make trouble for David Cameron, the London Mayor replied: 'I'm here to support the party.' The extraordinary scenes confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as the Tory party's biggest star .",

        "document": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Gary McKinnon, the hacker who broke into Pentagon and NASA computers, was at risk of suicide Friday after losing an effort to fight extradition to the United States, his attorney said. Gary McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, fears for her son's life after the Supreme Court decision. \"This is the wholesale destruction and bullying of a small individual by the United States and now our own government,\" attorney Karen Todner said in a statement. McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp described her son as \"suicidal.\" The British government did not respond. McKinnon, a British citizen, has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to U.S. government computers. The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time, accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001, and costing the government about $1 million. U.S. authorities want him extradited to face trial in the United States. McKinnon, currently free on bail in England, has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. McKinnon bases his case partly on the fact that he has Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism. He had hoped to bring his case before the nation's newly-formed Supreme Court. But the court rejected the request Friday. McKinnon has one effort left -- to appeal to the home secretary. \"The effect on Gary of these proceedings and impending extradition has been, and is, devastating,\" Todner's statement said. \"He is a highly vulnerable man in a very fragile state and this is a huge blow to him and his family.\" McKinnon is thought to have acted alone, with no known connection to any terrorist organization, said Paul McNulty, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. McKinnon has said it was easy for him to access the secret files.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Missy Franklin lives a double life. A normal teenager preparing for college, she is also a four-time Olympic gold medalist who is rewriting swimming's record books. When she's not dealing with the usual trials and tribulations of homework and school life, she's stepping out on the red carpet alongside Hollywood A-Listers. \"I describe my life as like Hannah Montana,\" the Pasadena-born, Colorado-based star told CNN. \"During the week I'm totally Missy, going to school every day and going to practice and just totally being me. \"But then at the weekend I'm flying out to the Golden Globes, going to these different events. It's crazy. It feels like I live a double life sometimes. \"But the way I describe it also is that it's not like my whole life has changed, just a part of it has changed.\" While Franklin has not yet reached the profile of Hannah Montana, the schoolgirl/popstar played in the kids' TV series and movies by Miley Cyrus, she is on her way. On Sunday, aged 18, Franklin helped the U.S. women's relay team to victory in the 4 x 100 meter medley at the world championships in Barcelona, giving her a record sixth gold medal of the meeting -- an unprecedented total for a female swimmer. Only her legendary compatriot Michael Phelps has won more gold medals at one championships. The \"Baltimore Bullet\" took seven golds at the 2007 event in Melbourne. When Phelps hung up his goggles at the end of London 2012, he charged Franklin with matching his legacy and equaling his record haul of 22 Olympic medals. No pressure then, Missy. \"On the last night we were in London, he (Phelps) had finished swimming, he was done,\" recalls Franklin. \"He looked at me and said, 'I have 56 world records, you're going to try and beat it. You gotta get after me.' \" Franklin was one of a vanguard of young female swimmers who ruled the waves at last year's Games. China's Ye Shiwen took two gold medals and stunned the world with her record-smashing swim in the final of the women's 400m individual medley, while Ruta Meilutyte, an unassuming Lithuanian, breezed to gold in the 100m breaststroke at the tender age of 15. But it was Franklin who made the biggest splash, clinching four gold medals and a bronze to announce herself as swimming's coming force. \"I shocked myself!\" explains Franklin. \"I didn't have any of those expectations going in whatsoever, I was just happy to be there. Happy to be on an amazing Olympic team and to be able to call myself an Olympian was a huge achievement in itself. \"After that I just wanted to get out there and make my country proud. That was my only goal, whatever came with it came with it -- and that happened to be five medals. I couldn't have planned it any better.\" With unexpected success comes new expectations -- and tough decisions. Notably she decided to postpone turning pro, temporarily spurning the possibility of earning millions of dollars in endorsements to become arguably the world's most marketable collegiate athlete. She also swapped Colorado for California, choosing to swim for the University of California's \"Golden Bears.\" She plans to join the professional ranks after the 2015 NCAA Championships. Juggling swimming with academia is now her biggest concern. \"It's very difficult, it's super hard,\" says Franklin. \"I'm done with high school, which is super sad to think about because I'm going to miss it so much. \"You hear about what the Olympics can do for someone's career, but it's unbelievable how much it really does. I've been able to meet the most incredible people and I think that's been the best part. \"Going to the Golden Globes and the VMAs (MTV awards), seeing my favorite actors and actresses and singers, going to all of these events and meeting other incredible athletes. It's been life-changing. \"All the work is very hard to keep up with, but all my teachers and my friends are awesome at helping me catch up with homework. \"It's all about time management. Swimming has to happen and homework has to happen, so it's figuring out how to get those things to work together.\" Another role Franklin has taken on is to encourage others to take up water-based sports. She spoke to CNN from the set of \"The Current,\" a film she is making with fellow American swimmer Mallory Weggemann -- a Paralympic gold medalist -- aimed at encouraging people with physical disabilities to take up scuba diving. \"We're making an inspirational documentary about helping people with physical disabilities find a passion for scuba diving,\" said Franklin. \"To help them realize that, even if you have a disability, it doesn't mean you can't do these things -- you might just have to do it a little bit differently. \"You can be free, you can let go of everything. That's one of my favorite things about swimming, no matter how hard my day was or how tired I am, I can just get into the pool and it doesn't matter. \"We're all equal when we get into the water, it's just us and the water. The water treats us all exactly the same.\" Despite those sentiments, U.S. swim fans will be hoping \"Missy the Missile\" is without equal when she takes to the pool in future Olympic Games.",

Brent Casey said went into a \"meltdown\" when he got a letter from the VA saying, erroneously, that he had ALS. Letters were sent August 13 to 1,864 veterans and survivors, the VA said in a written statement. They were supposed to be sent to veterans with ALS -- also known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- to keep them apprised of expanding benefits eligibility. \"According to the records of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), you have a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),\" said the letter, according to the National Gulf War Resource Center. \"This letter tells you about VA disability compensation benefits that may be available to you.\" But some who received the letters, like Brent Casey, do not have ALS.

After hearing from veterans who received the letter but do not have ALS, the VA immediately began reviewing individual claims files for all the recipients to determine who received the letter by mistake, agency spokeswoman Katie Roberts said in the statement. \"VA employees are personally contacting these individuals to ensure they understand the letter should not be confused with a medical diagnosis of ALS, explain why they mistakenly received the letter and express VA's sincere apologies for the distress caused by this unfortunate and regrettable error.\" \"It's not right for it to happen this way,\" Casey said. \"Regardless if it was the case that I was diagnosed with ALS, that would be the worst possible way for an organization to let an individual know.\" Upon receiving the letter, some veterans sought a second opinion outside the VA, according to veterans' service organizations, paying for doctors' consultations out of their own pockets. The VA said it will reimburse those veterans for the costs. In addition, the VA said it is reviewing its notification process to make sure a similar error doesn't happen again.

        "document": "Washington (CNN)The straight talking governor is suddenly mealy-mouthed over measles. As he toured the United Kingdom on Monday, Chris Christie seemed to leave his tough guy persona back in the United States. The potential Republican 2016 presidential contender punted on questions about whether Americans should vaccinate their kids amid a 14-state outbreak of a disease which is staging a comeback after being largely eradicated by science. \"All I can say is we vaccinated ours,\" Christie said, while touring a biomedical research facility in Cambridge, England, which makes vaccines. The New Jersey governor added that \"parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.\" Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? The meandering response trampled his message on a trip apparently meant to polish foreign policy credentials. And it was uncharacteristic for Christie, a political bruiser who regularly shouts down critics and, just a few months ago, defied the White House by forcibly quarantining a nurse who treated Ebola patients. WATCH: Obama: Vaccinate your kids . The flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is, Christie will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign. With Democrats pouncing on a new chance to brand Christie as \"anti-science\" and reporters jumping on a story that livened up a routine trade mission, the Christie camp rushed out an unusual clarification. \"To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,\" said Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts. \"At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.\" The episode hit the headlines because federal health officials are expressing alarm that a spate of measles cases is being fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules. The United States is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world. Experts note that infants face more than 20 shots before they are 18 months old and some parents question the speed and utility of all the doses. Claims picked up by the so-called anti-vaxxer movement, now debunked by scientific research, argue that shots can cause childhood autism and other unintended side effects. So it's not surprising that politicians should face questions about the issue --  especially if they are a governor who is thinking of running for president. Christie seems to have been tripped up more by policy than substance. When he spoke with nuance, it came across as a political calculation because his careful remarks contrasted with his own tendency to talk most of the time in an unmistakeably blunt way. \"Get the hell off the beach ... and get out, you're done,\" Christie, for instance, once told people he saw on news footage who had yet to take Hurricane Irene's approach seriously in 2011. So his equivocation on Monday raised questions over his motives. Was Christie for instance fudging on an issue that could play into suspicions of government mandates - in health care, education and other areas -- that could animate the 2016 Republican primary race? There is, after all, precedent for a vaccination flap having political reverberations in a primary race. Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry came under fire in 2012 from Republican opponents who opposed his executive order requiring girls to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus, which spreads through sexual transmission. Social conservatives opposed making the shot mandatory for girls as young as 11. Another candidate, Michele Bachmann, helped torpedo her own campaign by suggesting the drug could cause \"mental retardation.\" Christie is not the only candidate being forced to weigh in on the vaccinations debate which looks set to rumble through the 2016 campaign. Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a physician, said he thought vaccinations were a good thing but parents should have some input in how they are used. He told CNBC he had staggered a program of doses for his children when they were newborns. And he added that he had heard of \"many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\" Another potential Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was quoted by Buzzfeed.com as saying that \"vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense.\" But she added: \"I do think parents have to make those choices.\" Christie's struggles in getting his own message across may have several explanations, not all political. He could simply have been caught off guard in a place far from the early skirmishes of the Republican presidential sweepstakes. Or perhaps he was off his game, when appearing before a small traveling press pack, after battling a five-hour time difference to stay up late to watch the Super Bowl. But the episode is a reminder of the perils facing a politician who prizes speaking off the cuff. \"Is he going to have to be clarifying his comments all the time?\" said Jonathan Jaffe, a communications consultant who publishes a daily newsletter on New Jersey politics. MAP: The measles outbreak . \"Christie is a very casual speaker. He talks a lot of the time off the top of his head,\" Jaffe said, saying that quality could become a liability when every word is parsed by political journalists or opponents. Indeed, candidates like Christie who build a brand on straight talk, often face extra scrutiny when they appear to hedge on an argument. \"It depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,\" Christie said, trying to explain his initial quote. \"I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns.\" He went on: \"Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I'm not misunderstood.\" Christie's remarks, for once, were not as direct as those of the more professorial President Barack Obama, who touched on the issue in a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC. \"There is every reason to get vaccinated but there aren't reasons to not,\" said Obama, adding \"the science is pretty indisputable.\" Taken out of their political context, Christie's remarks seem a lot less contentious. Mark Largent, a Michigan State University professor who wrote a book about the vaccination debate in modern America, said that issues like inoculation schedules tend to be seen as a barometer for candidates on wider issues of scientific and medical issues. He says the debate is a rare one which cuts across political divides. On the right, objectors tend to sense the overweening hand of big government and infringments on individual liberties.  On the left, suspicion is driven by skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutrical industry, he said. The result is a debate in which legitimate concerns can be drowned out by politics. Christie \"is very moderate in what he is saying, but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine,\" Largent said. Christie's comments may also be conditioned by his time in New Jersey where there has been a spirited debate over the issue, with activists complaining about what they say are the nation's most expansive mandates for child vaccines. The Daily Beast reported on Monday that as far back as his first gubernatorial campaign in 2009, Christie expressed sympathy for parents of autistic children who wanted more input over which vaccines were administered to kids. The speed with which Christie's camp rushed to put out Monday's storm appeared to signal that the governor was not making some sort of clever play for government-hating activists on the conservative right -- a sector of the Republican Party where he must make inroads. But Democrats wouldn't give him a break, giving him a dose of his own tough talk. \"Chris Christie isn't a scientist. He isn't a doctor.

Ren Shihao, who has a brain tumour, told a local reporter in China's southwestern Sichuan province that he doesn't blame his mother for leaving the family, but added: 'I want to say I miss her. I want to say I love you mum. And I want her to hug me.' Ren can only see a few centimeters in front of his face as the growth puts pressure on his optic nerves. Ren Shihao's mother left the family before the 7-year-old was diagnosed with brain cancer but now refuses to come back as she has a new life with a different man. Here local volunteers play with Ren . The boy was diagnosed with cancer in September after his father, Cheng Li Ren, 35, took him to hospital when he began to feel ill. Cheng said: 'I took him to the hospital where they diagnosed him as suffering from a medulloblastoma, a kind of malignant cancer on the brain, in September. 'He had been feeling ill from September and in May he began to stagger. But hospital visits are hard for us to manage, we only took him there in September and the cancer was diagnosed. Doctor's in the regional capital of Chengdu operated on the growth, but by then it had already spread too far.

Ren's can only see a few centimeters in front of his face as the growth puts pressure on his optic nerves but maintains hope of seeing his mother again so he can hug her and tell her he loves her . After the failed operation Ren was sent back to his home in Yangyi village where local hospitals said they couldn't do anything for him and sent him home. His father added: 'He is starting to lose his sight, he thinks he will go blind, but he does not know he will die eventually. He wants only one thing, to see his mother before he loses his sight.' Ren's mother, Li Sun, left the household after arguments about money following his birth. Both parents had been forced to leave their village to work in the city, and Ren was raised by his grandmother, Zhao Yonglian. But the strain that put on the relationship was too much, and eventually Li kissed him goodbye and left. Cheng has since tracked her down, but she is in a new relationship and refuses to come back to see her dying child. He said: 'I never married her, and I left my son and managed to track her down, and discovered she now has a new life with a new man where she is married, so she has refused to come and see her son that we had.

But suspicious investigators launched an undercover probe as Wootton continued to claim her handouts four years on. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

        "document": "It is thought that up to one in 50 children globally have some form of autism, and this number continues to rise steadily each year. While there is no cure for the condition, the use of technology in autism treatment has grown in popularity in recent years, but the reasons for its success are only just being highlighted. Experts are finding that simple, carefully constructed apps are enabling affected children to feel safe and communicate more readily because the software is more predictable and ordered than human interaction. Researchers have found smartphones and tablets help autistic children develop new skills. Toca Boca, for example, create apps aimed at children aged three to six. Although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition . Autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person . communicates, and relates to, other people. It can also affect how they . make sense of the world around them. People . with autism typically have trouble communicating, looking people in the . eye, and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights. They may also have a sensitivity to touch, tastes, smells and colours. In particular, many autistic people like order and predictability. Autism . is a spectrum condition, which means that while all people with autism . share certain difficulties, their condition affects them in different . ways. Some people with . autism, for example, are able to live relatively independent lives but . others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist . support. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. Toca Boca in Sweden, for example, creates apps aimed primarily at children aged between three and six. Toca Band encourages children to make music and learn about rhythm and tempo, while Toca Hair Salon Me lets players give their family and friends virtual haircuts. The firm calls the characters in the apps ‘digital toys’ and although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition. Toby Price from Mississippi has a daughter called Addison, 11, who has non-verbal autism. He has noticed a marked improvement in Addison’s behaviour and skills since learning to use an iPad, and the Toca Boca apps. ‘When you have a child with autism take an interest in something, as a parent, you have to run with it,’ explained Price. ‘Addison . uses her iPad to show us things she wants, or places she would like to . go. She uses it to practice handwriting and even counting. ‘As a parent [I am] happy to have found a way to engage our kids with iPads.’ Rhiannan Walton, 32, from West London has been a speech . and language therapist for eight years. She began using technology . in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months . ago. ‘Technology . responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds . how you expect it to,' Walton told MailOnline. 'This particularly appeals to autistic children . who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.' Toby Price from Mississippi has a daughter called Addison, 11, pictured, who is non-verbal and has autism. He has noticed a positive improvement in Addison's behaviour and skills since learning to use an iPad. He said she uses it to show what she wants, or places she'd like to go. She uses it to practice handwriting and counting . Speech and Language Therapist Rhiannan Walton told MailOnline: 'Technology responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to. This particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.' Stock image of Apple's iOS 7 pictured . Many autistic children like trains, for . example, because they are predictable. They follow set paths along . stable tracks and their doors open and close in the same way each time. For therapy to work, Walton believes it has to be motivating and said technology . motivates children with autism in a unique way. ‘We . know therapy needs to be motivating for children in general, and . games are particularly motivating for children with autism because they’re . visually appealing. ‘Autistic children aren't motivated by wanting to please in the same way other children are. ‘Non-autistic . children think ‘this lady wants me to play this game and if I do, . she'll say well done,' but autistic children aren’t interested in that at . all. 'They need to be motivated in other ways - and technology helps . with this.' Autistic children typically have visual . ways of communicating, and as a result have a visual way of learning and . this is why apps are so effective. In a recent study, researchers from . Canada studied 12 children in six classrooms across Ontario, all of whom . have non-verbal autism spectrum disorder. These classrooms were given Apple iPads for a six-month trial. Following . the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement . ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills. The . devices were also found to boost motivation among 75 per cent of the . children, while also increasing their attention span and ability to . interact socially. Topcliffe . Primary School in Birmingham recently introduced touchscreen devices . into classrooms and similarly noticed an improvement among the autistic . students. ‘We watched . children with autism playing with the images on the screen in ways in . which none of the typically developing children had done, said . Topcliffe’s spectrum disorders teacher Sarah Quickenden. ‘The normal curriculum that we were offering just wasn't allowing them to demonstrate these skills to us. We never realised that the children had these skills because some of them are so locked in.’ Walton said the technology can also be used to build other communication opportunities. 'I give the children in my . therapy sessions the game, let them play it for a while before taking it . away. ‘We then work together to help the child show me that they want it back; they want to play more of the game.’ Once . this skill is developed, Walton continued, it can . be built upon to teach children about taking turns, sequencing, and so . on. It can also be generalised for other tasks, such as asking for more food or drink. Researchers from Canada recently studied children with non-verbal autism, stock image pictured, who were each Apple iPads for a six-month trial at school. Following the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills . Walton told MailOnline that apps and games . have the added benefit of appealing to children without autism, . especially the siblings of those who do have the condition. This means families can manage the child’s condition as a group, and helps siblings play together. Price’s . son McKade, for example, recently set up a tea party with sister . Addison after she had learned the skills from the Toca Kitchen game. Autistic children typically have visual ways of communicating and learning. This is why apps such as Toca Hair Salon Me, pictured, are so effective . Walton said many of her autistic patients pick up the games quickly, and have good memory, so will remember skills they’ve learnt when at home with their parents. Vicki Clarke is the owner and president of Dynamic Therapy Associates with 18 years’ experience as a Speech Language Pathologist and Augmentative Communication Specialist in Georgia. She told Autism Speaks: ‘People are messy and computers are neat. For our friends with autism, this consistency is easy to understand and comforting. ‘The iPad puts this comfortable, predictable teaching friend right in the hands of our children with autism, regardless of where they are.’ But she continued technology isn’t a ‘miracle cure’. ‘The specific needs of the child need to be the main deciding factor on purchasing any technology,’ explained Clarke. ‘These technologies are simply another tool in our box that have the potential to help meet some of the needs of our children. ‘When deciding on technology options, teams must consider the individual needs of the child and the ability of the app to meet the comprehensive needs for which they are purchased. ‘Families should consult with the professional and personal friends who know the child and can offer input on potential needs of the child. Today marks the seventh annual World . Autism Awareness Day, in which organisations get together to discuss the . challenges surrounding the disorder, share advice, and look for . solutions.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:31 EST, 24 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:07 EST, 25 September 2012 . A European court has ruled that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri can be extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges, including allegedly trying to set up an al-Qaida training camp in rural Oregon. The decision ends a long-running legal battle and means that al-Masri, considered one of Britain's most notorious extremists, could be deported to the U.S. within weeks along with four other terrorism suspects. Authorities in the U.S. have for years asked for Al-Masri and the others to be handed over, but the process had been delayed because the men raised human rights objections. Kicked out: The ruling brings an end to a legal saga over Abu Hamza which has lasted eight years and cost more than $1.5million . The men had argued before the European Court of Human Rights that they could face prison conditions and jail terms in the U.S. that would expose them to ‘torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ in breach of the European human rights code. In April, the Strasbourg, France-based court rejected those claims. Al-Masri and the four others lodged an appeal to the court's highest judges, but on Monday the court said it refused to hear it. That ruling brings an end to a legal saga which has lasted eight years and cost the British taxpayer more than $1.6million (£1million). ‘Today the Grand Chamber Panel decided to reject the request,’ the court said in a brief statement. It did not give a reason for refusing the appeal. Britain's Home Office and the U.S. Department of Justice welcomed the decision. ‘We will work to ensure that the individuals are handed over to the U.S. authorities as quickly as possible,’ said the Home Office. Worshippers: Hamza (pictured centre, wearing blue) earned global notoriety for his vile sermons outside the Finsbury Park Mosque in London . In Washington, Dean Boyd, spokesman for the National Security Division of the U.S. justice department, said: ‘We are pleased that the litigation before the European Court of Human Rights in these cases has come to an end, and we will be working with the U.K. authorities on the arrangements to bring these subjects to the United States for prosecution.’ The suspects, who are accused of crimes such as raising funds for terrorists, could face life sentences in a maximum-security prison. One of the world’s most dangerous preachers of hate, Al-Masri  was arrested in Britain in 2004 at the request of U.S. authorities, who have called him ‘a terrorist facilitator with a global reach.’ They accuse him of assisting the taking of 16 hostages - including two American tourists - in Yemen in 1998 and of conspiring to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, between 2000 and 2001. U.S. authorities have called Hamza ¿a terrorist facilitator with a global reach¿ . He also is accused of conspiring with a U.S. citizen to facilitate a jihad - or holy war - in Afghanistan and providing material support to al-Qaida and the Taliban. The cleric, who is blind in one eye and wears a hook for a hand, lost several British court cases in his fight against extradition before taking the case to the European court in 2008. Known for his fiery anti-Western and anti-Semitic outbursts, he claims he has lost his Egyptian nationality, but Britain considers him an Egyptian citizen. He is currently serving a seven-year prison term in Britain for separate charges of inciting hatred. The other four suspects due to be extradited to the U.S. are Babar Ahmad, Syed Tahla Ahsan, Khaled al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary. Ahmad and Ahsan are charged in U.S. federal court in Connecticut with running a terrorist website in London, providing material support to terrorists, conspiring to kill U.S. nationals, and money laundering. Supporters of Ahmad, who was arrested in 2004 and has been held in a British jail since then without charge, are trying to help him get a trial in Britain because his alleged offense happened in London. Radical muslim clerk Sheikh Abu Hamza allegedly lost an eye and had both hands blown off by a mine in Afghanistan . Al-Fawwaz and Bary, accused of being key aides to Osama bin Laden in London, are wanted in a New York federal court for the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Al-Fawwaz faces many counts of murder. The human rights court said that it has not decided on the case of a sixth suspect, Haroon Rashid Aswat, who was accused of being Al-Masri's co-conspirator in attempting to set up the camp in Oregon. The court said it needed to consider more information about his case. Hamza was first arrested at the request of the U.S. in May 2004 but the extradition was halted when the UK decided to charge him on allegations relating to his sermons. In 2006, he was jailed for seven years for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque. The extradition proceedings resumed once Hamza became eligible for release. He arrived in Britain more than 30 years ago and has seven children from a second marriage. In the late 1980s, he headed to Afghanistan but returned a few years later having lost an eye and both hands – allegedly blown off by a mine.",

        "document": "By . Daniel Martin . UPDATED: . 04:43 EST, 1 October 2011 . An alliance of European countries is rebelling against EU plans to make Britain open its doors to thousands of ‘benefit tourists’. Ministers have joined forces with 12 other nations – including France, Germany and Denmark – angry at the European Commission’s threat to take the UK to court over rules which limit foreigners’ ability to claim benefits. If the Commission gets its way, Britain could be hit with an extra £2.5billion in welfare payments, making it even harder to tackle our huge deficit. Present rules: Currently, the UK says EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain  Duncan Smith warned that the move  was just the latest example of ‘unelectable and unaccountable’ European  institutions’ desire to grab power from national parliaments. The row comes as Tories gather for  their annual conference in Manchester amid a growing clamour from Eurosceptic backbenchers to use the eurozone  crisis as a lever to get Brussels powers returned to Britain. Last night former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the issue showed why Foreign Secretary William Hague should enter into negotiations with EU leaders to get powers handed back to Britain. He wrote on his blog: ‘What is he doing about it? Why won’t he get on with renegotiating the UK position? ‘Most UK electors want a trade agreement but do not want to be bossed around by a high spending legislature poking its nose into our domestic affairs.’ Diktat: The European Commission in Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the 'human rights' of EU citizens . Concerns: It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here . At present the UK says that EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits. But on Thursday Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the ‘human rights’ of EU citizens. It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here. Benefits are much more generous in the West than among the former Soviet-dominated countries of the East. 'Out of order': Iain Duncan Smith said Europe was encroaching on social security . For example, a person who has been . unemployed for more than three months in Poland gets a dole of just £110 . a month. This is less than half the £270 or so he would get if he moved . to the UK. So far only Britain has been threatened with court action, but yesterday an EU official warned that other countries could be next if their residence rules are deemed too strict. Chris Grayling, the Employment Minister, revealed growing anger among European governments and said he would be bringing up the issue at a meeting of ministers in Brussels in three weeks’ time. His alliance is made up of prosperous Western European countries which are also worried about an influx from former Communist states if they are forced to change their rules. They, too, face huge costs if they have to tighten up their rules. France, for example, will currently not pay out benefits unless migrants have worked in the country for at least four months. Mr Grayling told the BBC: ‘There is a very definite difference of opinion between us and the Commission over this. I don’t think somebody coming from another EU state should be able to access benefit simply by turning up here and saying, “I am going to live in the UK from now on”. ‘The truth is European law is all over the place at the moment. We had a case three months ago in which we were instructed by the European Court to make disability payments to a British citizen, a young woman living in Spain. 'This kind of land grab has the potential to cause mayhem... we will fight it' ‘We can’t be responsible both for benefits to be paid to our citizens overseas and to citizens of other countries in the UK. What we have ended up with is a mess and it is not a mess that simply faces the UK – it is one that affects several other states.’ Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘This is out of order. Social security was always considered to be a national responsibility, but now Europe is encroaching on these areas. ‘This kind of land grab from the EU has the potential to cause mayhem to nation states, and we will fight it.’ It emerged yesterday that Nick Clegg told EC president Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday that Britain would fight any attempt to force us to pay benefits to workless EU migrants. The Lib Dems’ support for the Government on this issue is in contrast to their refusal to join the Tories in opposing the extension of employment rights to agency workers. A source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘Nick thinks this is a really bad idea. It is one thing to look after European citizens who have worked over here and paid taxes, but it is quite another to start writing cheques to anyone and everyone who turns up.’ A spokesman for the European Commission said the UK was being targeted first because complaints had been received about the rule here. But she warned that other countries would be next.She said: ‘We have issues with other countries but the UK case is much more advanced.’",

        "document": "Davos (CNN) -- RICHARD QUEST SAYS: The U.S. bank robber Willie Sutton once famously answered the question on why he robbed banks with the reply, \"because that's where the money is.\" The same should be said for Davos and the issue of inequality. It may stick in Nina's throat but it is an undeniable truth that it is the people who are attending Davos who can make changes. Frankly, no amount of shouting and protesting will make any difference if those in charge of policy and agendas aren't persuaded by the arguments and decide to do something. And frankly, when it comes to getting all the right people in the same place at the same time, Davos is unique. In Davos during the WEF we have government heads like David Cameron, Shinzo Abe, Tony Abbott and Dilma Rousseff. These are the people who can actually get something done. There is a reason why Pope Francis sent his Cardinal to Davos, and who gave us the quote of the day when he said we must ensure \"humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it.\" This was not a quixotic message ... he knows that if he wants to create the change of greater fairness and equality, those who have power must be on board rather than just bleating about unfairness and hoping someone might listen. This is all about reality rather than fantasy... From the corporate world, there are CEOs here like Muhtar Kent of Coca Cola, Carlos Ghosn of Renault-Nissan, Bob Dudley of BP and Aliko Dangote Africa's richest man. Between them they employ hundreds of thousands of people all across the globe. Their companies set working conditions and wage standards for whole sectors of industry, frequently amongst the low paid. Where they lead others will follow, creating a multiplier effect out of proportion to their individual company. Then there are the extra governmental groups like the International Labour Organization and NGOs like Oxfam International who push these agendas hard. Oxfam International's conclusion that the 85 richest people own half the world's wealth generated huge interest. The director told me Oxfam came to Davos to warn if we don't break out of this power and wealth privilege and opportunity then it \"is dangerous.\" Nina, with all the players in the same place, at the same time this is the perfect venue to raise such issues. Of course there is the risk that leaders and CEOs choose to ignore these calls for greater equality. If they do that they will be closing their eyes to the warnings from groups like the WEF itself. In its latest Global Risks report WEF says inequality is now the greatest threat to global stability. \"Income disparity is also among the most worrying of issues. It raises concerns about the Great Recession and the squeezing effect it had on the middle classes in developed economies,\" opines the WEF. Bearing in mind most companies rely on the middle classes in developed countries to sell goods and services throughout the value chain, dealing with inequality is a matter of brutal enlightened self-interest. It's simple economics: Global stability equals global growth equals profits. So -- Nina -- you tell me a better place where you can advise, consult and ultimately warn those with so much at stake of the risks of doing nothing. Or perhaps you would like to stand out in the cold. Talking to yourself. I think I would prefer to talk to those who can actually do something. NINA DOS SANTOS SAYS: From 1,500 meters above sea level you get a great view of the world's big issues. And if you occupy the lofty upper echelons of the ladder -- which many Davos attendees do -- the picture's even clearer right? Wrong. You see, Richard, while you may consider yourself at home among the world's 1%, the very attributes that make a Davos guest so ideal -- power and money -- often clash with some of the subjects those very delegates are here to tackle. That's especially true when it comes to this year's \"theme du jour\": Inequality. Of course getting so many of the world's decision makers in the same room affords its opportunities. But when they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, you have to ask what appetite -- if any -- they would have for change. Also how credible would their views actually be? Take a look at the thorny subject of executive remuneration, which helps feed today's inequality spiral and should keep the corporate crowd on their toes this year. In the UK, for instance, the average blue chip boss can earn up to a staggering 185 times the salary of their ordinary worker. And in the U.S., the chasm looms even wider. I was surprised to hear the CEO of accountancy firm Ernst & Young confess to me on air that he had never investigated the gap between his compensation and that of his more junior staff. \"Should you know this?\" I asked. He protested that he created jobs all around the world. As if that, somehow, makes it okay. Job creation is a valid argument but it doesn't detract from the fact that some Davos attendees are so high up the food chain they are either divorced from reality or willfully blind to what doesn't affect them. Until it costs them money or votes, which is why, as you point out Richard, the \"squeezed middle\" has made its way up the agenda, arguably decades too late. Pope Francis' decision to send a papal envoy to Davos was a game changer this year. But his message -- read out by Cardinal Turkson -- wasn't just about lobbying those in power, it was also about making sure those suffering hardship and financial strain are also represented among the World Economic Forum elites. You see recessions and recovery have a habit of treating the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\" differently. And while those further down an organization are more likely to face the ax when times are lean, they don't benefit as much as their bosses when business is better. But don't take my word for it, Richard. Let the figures speak for themselves. Oxfam's report about the top 85 fortunes having a stranglehold over the world's riches has certainly captured public attention but the trend was already well known. A few years ago Branko Milanovic of the World Bank estimated that between 1988 and 2008, around the world, the highest earners saw their income rise by 60% while the lowest 5% haven't witnessed any uptick at all. And that's just income. Don't get me started on the wealth gap, where inheritances, better access to capital and contacts amplify the trend. Richard, you say you would prefer to talk to \"those who matter\" but I caution you, one can learn a lot from the 99% who actually staff their firms and fund their government's trips to Davos. They do the doing rather than the talking. And guess what? They count just as much. Global economic recovery feeds growing inequality . Opinion: Will global elite listen to Pope of poor?",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Peter Mance knows every street before he sets foot in a city. It's not because he's visited before. It's because he's autistic and has an uncanny ability to memorize maps. \"He's actually a big help when traveling,\" jokes his mother, Kim Mance, founder of women's travel blog Galavanting and the Travel Blog Exchange, a community of travel writers and bloggers. Mance's other son, 10-year-old son Stephen, has used a wheelchair since surgery to remove a spinal tumor left him paralyzed from the waist down. Mance always has to make extra phone calls to ensure there's an accessible subway or hotel room, but that hasn't stopped her from vacationing with her sons all over the world. While she mostly travels for work, Mance says taking Peter on trips since he was diagnosed with autism at age 2½ helped him not get \"rutted into routine.\" Some autistic children can't stand to have their schedules disrupted, she explained. \"By [traveling] consistently over time, he's developed ways to cope with being outside his routine,\" she said. To help comfort Peter, Mance created games -- like hunting to find his pajamas -- that he plays in every new place he visits. Traveling with children is difficult, but when children have wheelchairs or communication problems, it can be overwhelming for parents to plan even a weekend getaway. \"You cannot pick up and go like everyone else does. You have to plan your trip very carefully,\" says Jani Nayar, executive coordinator of the Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality. About 2.9 million youths ages 17 and younger have a disability, according to the 2009 American Community Survey. Even if it requires extra planning, Nayar says, it's important for children with disabilities -- whether they're blind, deaf, autistic or use a wheelchair -- to \"get out of the house and travel like any other child.\" Michell Haase, founder of TravelinWheels.com, a site that offers travel tips for disabled people, suggests that families \"start small.\" \"It doesn't have to be the big trip to France,\" she said. For families that haven't traveled before, Haase suggests driving to a nearby city and trying a hotel stay. In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act required that hotels provide accessible amenities. But when booking a room, Haase says to be specific about your needs. \"Don't just ask if the room is accessible, because it means so many things to so many people,\" she said. It's OK to ask questions and request for a certain bed height or shower chair, she added. During trips, Haase has persuaded hotel managers to get rid of their shower chairs without supportive backs in favor of ones that people with balance issues, like her daughter Kelsey, can use. Kelsey, 18, uses a wheelchair because she has spina bifida, a condition that prevents the spinal cord from developing. She has traveled all over the country as a wheelchair athlete and is the national powerlifting champion for her weight class. Though Kelsey's mother plans ahead by making phone calls and researching accessible options online, the two have had their fair share of travel hiccups. The list includes being stuck in the rain at a rental car facility without an accessible shuttle and being stranded in excruciating heat when a Chicago trolley car was too crowded to fit her daughter's wheelchair. Regardless of the amount of planning, parents can't predict a broken subway elevator or an unexpected flight of stairs. \"I'm always having to be five steps ahead of the game and thinking what we're going to need. And then, when it doesn't work out, it becomes really frustrating,\" Haase said. Overcoming the intimidation of taking a trip is the biggest obstacle, Mance says. But once parents get over the learning curve of knowing where to go and how to get from point A to point B, traveling with a disabled child becomes second nature. \"Over the years, I've developed this sixth sense about which entrance is more likely to have a ramp or certain places that may be able to accommodate even just space between chairs at restaurants,\" says Mance, who has taken her sons to Japan, Morocco and several European countries. Sometimes, Mance has her autistic son, Peter, wear a button or T-shirt that says, \"I'm autistic. Please be patient.\" The message is a friendly reminder to other travelers that her son isn't purposely acting out. \"You'd be surprised how somebody can get really irritable because they think your kid is misbehaving,\" she said. About one in 110 children have an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though Mance says Peter looks forward to each excursion, not all autistic children handle new adventures well. \"There are some kids with autism that love to travel and do really well. For others, it can just be more challenging,\" said Lisa Goring, the vice president of family services at Autism Speaks. If a child thrives in rigid routines, Goring suggests parents tell their child in advance that they will be exploring a new place. Creating a book with pictures of the travel destination can also help children know what to expect. When planning a trip, find out if attractions in the area offer special programs. The Garden State Discovery Museum in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, has Open Arms Family Evenings several times a year. The program allows families with autistic children to explore the hands-on museum, which includes simulating scenarios such as visiting a doctor's office, buying fruit at a market and ordering food at a diner. Autistic children who struggle with daily activities benefit from the museum, said Judy Shapiro, director of sales and marketing. \"The more they can practice in a safe environment, the better they are in the real world because it's not new to them,\" she said. Parents who don't want to navigate cities may enjoy cruises that have accessible pools and programs just for kids. Nayar pointed out that many ships allow parents and their disabled children to attend youth activities together. The all-time best place to travel with a disabled child? The Magic Kingdom, mothers and travel experts say. \"Disney World is the nirvana,\" Haase says. \"We usually go to Disney World and almost forget that there's any issue.\" Disney provides Guest Assistance Cards for anyone with a disability. Guests can use the cards to wait in separate lines for rides, and up to five members may go on the attraction with the cardholder. Mance recently took her kids to Disney World and said the pass allowed her family to get through the lines \"exponentially faster.\" She said her son loved the graffiti-style signs with a wheelchair symbol because they were geared toward kids. \"He felt so accepted,\" she said. Disney also permits a family member to test a ride -- without waiting in line twice -- to gauge how a disabled child may react before he or she gets on. In case rides or crowds are too loud, Mance brings along ear plugs so Peter can block the noise. New York City is one of the most accessible cities in the country, according to Nayar. Besides accessible museums and public transportation, organizations are spearheading efforts to make theater productions more accessible. In June, the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts kicked off the Broadway Accessibility Initiative, which aims to make Broadway shows more enjoyable for the deaf and the blind. At no charge, hearing impaired theatergoers may use I-Caption, a handheld device that displays dialogue, lyrics and show announcements. Visually impaired patrons may use D-Scriptive, an audio device that relates all visual elements of a show, including choreography, lighting, sets and costumes. The goal is to \"open up Broadway to an audience who has historically not been reached out to,\" said Sharon Jensen, executive director of Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts. Families that prefer outdoor recreation don't have to stay at home either. Almost all national parks have accessible hiking trails or activities like kayaking. Some state parks -- in states such as Wisconsin,  Pennsylvania and  South Dakota -- have accessible cabins that include kitchens with low counters, showers that fit wheelchairs and hospital beds with lifts. \"Traveling allows kids to see the world in a positive light, but planning a dream vacation isn't going to be simple,\" Haase said. \"Especially when they're disabled, you want them to have a good experience, so it's a lot of pressure,\" she said. But by not staying in the protection of their own home, Haase says, she and Kelsey are showing able-bodied people what they can change at hotels, restaurants and attractions to make life a little easier on others. \"It's one thing to have a law that says you have to do this,\" she said. \"It's a whole other thing to see somebody experience the struggle and then want to help them.\"",

Bob Lindo has written to Home Secretary Theresa May to vent his anger over the scam to trick foreigners into buying a ‘British’ souvenir when they come to watch the Olympics or Queen’s Jubilee celebrations. Mr Lindo, who owns the Camel Valley vineyard at Wadebridge, Cornwall, forced the World Duty Free shop at Gatwick Airport to remove a sign heralding French champagne as the ‘Best of British’ following an incident on Tuesday night. Scam: Winemaker Bob Lindo, right, wrote to the Home Secretary and Defra to complain after spotting this display of French Lanson champagne at Gatwick Airport, left . The Lanson champagne bottles were wrapped in Union flags which Mr Lindo says is ‘unacceptable’. In his letter to May, who is one of his customers, Mr Lindo wrote: 'I had to insist on the Best of British sign being removed from the Lanson display stand in the duty free shop at Gatwick airport. They removed the sign after I refused to leave until they did. 'This is clearly an attempt to con visitors for the Olympics and the Jubilee into taking home a \"British\" souvenir.

He said in his letter to Lanson: 'On behalf of English Wine producers I wish to formally and most strongly state our objections to a promotion being carried by Champagne Lanson of which they are very clearly passing off and purporting to \"Best of British\".' Mr Lindo said: 'It made my blood boil when I saw that sign - it was a deliberate attempt to pass the champagne off as British when it is most certainly not. 'If anyone dares to call their wines champagne, the French go mad and start suing people.'

        "document": "By . Geri Peev and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 19:00 EST, 10 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:12 EST, 11 November 2013 . The Government was last night accused of profiting from ‘vulnerable’ people by forcing them to phone premium-rate numbers. A damning investigation has found that more than 100million calls to State-backed offices by crime victims, pensioners, the recently bereaved and students were to high-rate numbers charging up to 35p a minute. Downing Street hinted that premium-rate numbers could be banned for advice lines for grieving families, after MPs condemned the widespread use of the lines which cost callers £56million in 2012/13. Frustration: Premium numbers for calling public bodies are costing the taxpayer millions - almost half of which is wasted waiting on hold . Nearly two thirds of calls fielded by government organisations were made to the higher-rate 0845 numbers, a Commons committee found. Only 40 out of the 365 customer phone lines are free to use. Anyone who phones a government line to report the death of a spouse for tax or benefits purposes pays premium rates, while the Student Loans Company also uses the numbers, saying that doing away with them would cost it £1million in revenue. Almost half the £56million was generated while callers were on hold, waiting to speak to advisers. Last night Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said:  ‘Customers of government services should be able to contact these services easily and cheaply. ‘Charging customers higher rates by making them use 0845 or other high-rate numbers is not acceptable, especially when the customers are often vulnerable.’ Pocketed by the taxman: HMRC was held up as an example of 'astonishingly bad' customer service, keeping callers on hold for an average of seven minutes . She said the Cabinet Office had to urgently establish rules for charging, adding: ‘There should be low-cost alternatives for all services used by a lot of vulnerable people.’ Callers should also be informed of the costs involved in phoning particular numbers, her committee concluded. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s ridiculous that people face a bumper bill to call a public body, especially when they have to wait on hold. ‘Almost 60,000 people have supported our Costly Calls campaign for all companies and public bodies to provide either freephone or local rate numbers for their customer service and complaints lines. ‘This practice has been costing cash-strapped consumers millions of pounds.’ 'Not acceptable': Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said new rules were urgently needed . The committee also found that many departments were ‘astonishingly bad’ at answering calls. HMRC answered only 16 per cent of the calls it received on its tax credits helpline on the deadline day for notifying the department of changes of circumstances. Customers to the tax department were put on hold for an average of seven minutes. The Cabinet Office told the committee that the current situation was unacceptable. It has set up a working group to define new rules for premium-rate numbers within government. David Cameron's official spokesman said the Prime Minister was concerned about the use of costly phone lines for people looking for advice when a loved one dies. The spokesman added: 'He does understand concerns that people have, particular when it comes to advice people are taking at challenging times of their family’s lives such as bereavement. ‘That is something that should be looked at closely.’ Outside central government, NHS trusts and GPs have also faced criticism for using premium-rate numbers. Mrs Hodge said that one of her East London constituents spent £30 to make an appointment for her 30-year-old disabled son with a GP. She added: ‘I don’t know how many calls she had to make. That is a shocker.’ Jeff Gardner, head of Victim Support’s help line, said: ‘We are currently looking at ways of reducing the cost to people calling Victim Support’s support line.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘The DWP provides free telephone numbers (0800) for all of our claim lines. The DWP does not earn any revenue from 0845 numbers.'",

        "document": "President Barack Obama on Tuesday bestowed the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on 13 people from all walks of life, hailing them for changing the world for the better. One of them, Dr. William Foege, helped lead the effort to eradicate smallpox, saving millions of lives. Madeleine Albright was the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, and Toni Morrison was the first African-American women to win a Nobel Prize. Others who stood calmly while Obama placed the medal around their necks included singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, wearing dark glasses indoors and never smiling; civil rights enforcer John Doar; former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens; worker and women's advocate Dolores Huerta;  former University of Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt, and former astronaut and U.S. Sen. John Glenn. Three recipients were honored posthumously -- Jan Karski, the former Polish officer who escaped Nazi imprisonment and provided firsthand accounts to the Western Allies of atrocities he witnessed in Warsaw; Gordon Hirabayashi, who defied the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and Juliette Gordon Low, the founder of the Girl Scouts. A 13th winner, former Israeli President Shimon Peres, will receive his medal at a White House dinner later this year, Obama said. \"What sets these men and women apart is the incredible impact they have had on so many people, not in short and blinding bursts, but steadily, over the course of a lifetime,\" the president said Tuesday. \"They have moved us with their words, they have inspired us with their actions.\" They also affected his life, the nation's first African-American president noted. Referring to Doar, a Justice Department official in the 1960s who pushed for integration, Obama said: \"I think it's fair to say that I might not be here had it not been for his work.\" \"I remember reading 'Song of Solomon' when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write but also how to be and how to think,\" he said in reference to Morrison's 1977 novel. \"And I remember, you know, in college, listening to Bob Dylan and my world opening up, 'cause he captured something about this country that was so vital. And I think about Dolores Huerta, reading about her when I was starting off as an organizer. Everybody on this stage has marked my life in profound ways.\" Obama called the medal \"one more accolade for a life well lived\" and the crowd of dignitaries responded to his urging at the end with a lusty ovation. The president also injected some humor into the ceremony, beginning his remarks by noting the packed East Room was \"a testament to how cool this group is -- everybody wants to check them out.\" The medal is awarded to those who make extraordinary contributions to world peace, national interest and security or other cultural endeavors. It was established in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. Here is a list of this year's recipients and some of the information released by the White House on why they were selected: . Madeleine Albright . From 1997 to 2001, under President Bill Clinton, Albright served as the 64th United States secretary of state, the first woman to hold that position. During her tenure, she worked to enlarge NATO and helped lead the alliance's campaign against terror and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, pursued peace in the Middle East and Africa, sought to reduce the dangerous spread of nuclear weapons and was a champion of democracy, human rights and good governance across the globe. John Doar . Doar was a legendary public servant and leader of federal efforts to protect and enforce civil rights during the 1960s. He served as assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. In that capacity, he was instrumental during many major civil rights crises, including singlehandedly preventing a riot in Jackson, Mississippi, after the funeral of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963. Bob Dylan . One of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century, Dylan released his first album in 1962. Known for his rich and poetic lyrics, his work had considerable influence on the civil rights movement of the 1960s and has had significant impact on American culture over the past five decades. William Foege . A physician and epidemiologist, Foege helped lead the successful campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. He was appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1977 and, with colleagues, founded the Task Force for Child Survival in 1984. Foege became executive director of The Carter Center in 1986 and continues to serve the organization as a senior fellow. John Glenn . Glenn is a former United States Marine Corps pilot, astronaut, and United States senator. In 1962, he was the third American in space and the first American to orbit the Earth. After retiring from the Marine Corps, Glenn was elected to the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 1974.  He was an architect and sponsor of the 1978 Nonproliferation Act and served as chairman of the Senate Government Affairs committee from 1978 until 1995. Gordon Hirabayashi . Hirabayashi openly defied the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, he refused the order to report for evacuation to an internment camp, instead turning himself in to the FBI to assert his belief that these practices were racially discriminatory. Consequently, he was convicted by a U.S. Federal District Court in Seattle of defying the exclusion order and violating curfew. Hirabayashi appealed his conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against him in 1943. After World War II and his time in prison, Hirabayashi obtained his doctoral degree in sociology and became a professor.  In 1987, his conviction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Hirabayashi died on January 2, 2012. Dolores Huerta . Huerta is a civil rights, workers and women's advocate. With Cesar Chavez, she co-founded the National Farmworkers Association in 1962, which later became the United Farm Workers of America. Huerta has served as a community activist and a political organizer, and was influential in securing the passage of California's Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, and disability insurance for farm workers in California. Jan Karski . Karski served as an officer in the Polish Underground during World War II and carried among the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the world. He worked as a courier, entering the Warsaw ghetto and the Nazi Izbica transit camp, where he saw firsthand the atrocities occurring under Nazi occupation. Juliette Gordon Low . Born in 1860, Low founded the Girl Scouts in 1912. The organization strives to teach girls self-reliance and resourcefulness.  It also encourages girls to seek fulfillment in the professional world and to become active citizens in their communities. Toni Morrison . One of our nation's most celebrated novelists, Morrison is renowned for works such as \"Song of Solomon,\" \"Jazz\" and \"Beloved\", for which she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988. When she became the first African-American woman to win a Nobel Prize in 1993, Morrison's citation captured her as an author \"who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.\" Shimon Peres . An ardent advocate for Israel's security and for peace, Shimon Peres was elected the ninth president of Israel in 2007. First elected to the Knesset in 1959, he has served in a variety of positions throughout the Israeli government, including in 12 Cabinets as foreign minister, minister of defense, and minister of transport and communications. Peres served as prime minister from 1984-1986 and 1995-1996. John Paul Stevens . Stevens served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 to 2010, when he retired as the third longest-serving justice in the court's history. Known for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law and the separation of powers. Pat Summitt . In addition to accomplishing an outstanding career as the all-time winningest leader among all NCAA basketball coaches, Summitt has taken the University of Tennessee to more Final Four appearances than any other coach and has the second best record of NCAA championships in basketball.",

A thirteen-year-old burglar ransacked a disabled woman's house - killing her pet fish, decapitating her dolls and damaging her wheelchair - a court has heard. The boy, who cannot be named, even smirked while being interviewed by the police about the attack at the home of cerebral palsy sufferer Maria Hill in Cheltenham. Now aged 14, the youngster was . sentenced to 12 months detention and training by magistrates last month . - but today appealed against his sentence at Gloucester Crown Court. Attack: The boy smirked during a police interview about the attack on the home of Maria Hill in Cakebridge Road, Cheltenham . Ms Hill, 33, has been left feeling 'petrified' of continuing to live alone, Gloucester crown court heard. The boy asked the crown court to consider freeing him with a supervision and rehabilitation order. But Recorder Nigel Pascoe QC dismissed the appeal, telling the boy his crime as 'so terrible and so cruel that what you did is more important than the remorse you have since shown and the alternative which is put before the court.' Mr Pascoe said the court did not think magistrates were wrong to impose the sentence they did. 'While we accept you have shown remorse for your behaviour in the letter you have written to us and in the reports on you we have no doubt the sentence was justified.' Errina Foley-Fisher, prosecuting, said Ms Hill left her home in Cakebridge Road, Cheltenham, on December 22 to go to stay with her mother in Cirencester for Christmas. 'The details of what happened are quite disturbing,' she said. 'The defendant smashed an upstairs bedroom window to get in. In that bedroom a mattress was turned upside down, a three foot pine cabinet was thrown to the floor and broken. 'The destruction continued into her own bedroom. Every drawer was opened. Her clothes were thrown around. The wires of her electric disability duvet were cut. Presents of geisha dolls from her mother from her trips to Japan were decapitated. Some of the wrapped Christmas presents she had left in the house were opened and stolen.' Court: The boy appealed against his sentence for the attack at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) - but was told his remorse did not make up for his crime . Ms Foley-Fisher said there were obvious signs in the house that it belonged to a disabled woman, including a wheelchair in the kitchen 'which was overturned and the gearstick broken off.' Two 60-litre fish tanks in the living room were smashed and the majority of the fish had been killed, she said, including one which had been thrown against a wall. There were three stab marks in the TV. 'A knife had also been stabbed into her suitcases. Money, jewellery and stamps were taken,' said Ms Foley-Fisher. Police arrested the boy nearby in the early hours of December 23 and found the stolen property on him, she said. The boy swore at the officers but then admitted that the property came from Ms Hill's house. In a victim impact statement Ms Hill said: 'Prior to this event I have always been a bubbly, outgoing person. I would talk to anybody. I am nice, not malicious in any way because I have been brought up that way.' She said she was distressed by the thought 'that somebody could violate me.' 'I live with a disability, cerebral palsy, which is a challenge. To think that someone could or would do this to me makes you question yourself,' she said. She said she had started questioning the people's nature following the incident, and that it has made her look over her shoulder. Daniel Cavaglieri, defending, conceded that it was 'difficult to imagine an additional aggravating feature that might have occurred' but submitted that the boy had already had a 'salutary lesson' from spending the last five weeks in custody and would now benefit from supervision to try to correct his attitude and behavour.",

A man has been jailed after crashing his car and killing his girlfriend while driving at 'vastly excessive speeds'. Daniel Day was sentenced to nearly three years in prison after losing control of his partner Alice Hicks' car on a country road at 80mph. She was a passenger in the convertible Mini-cooper and was thrown from the car when he crashed into another vehicle driving in the opposite direction. Day, 34, denied causing death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury at Taunton Crown Court after just 40 minutes of deliberations. 'Reckless': Daniel Day, 34 (left), has been jailed for causing death by dangerous driving following the smash that killed his girlfriend Alice Hicks, 27 (right) The court heard that neither Day nor . Miss Hicks, 27, were wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision . which happened on September 24 2011. He was speeding along the A38 near Rooksbridge, Somerset, when the road was blocked by a van that was waiting to turn right. Witnesses described how Day had . little or no chance of stopping behind the stationary traffic and he . swerved to avoid the van but hit a Mazda on the other side of the road. 'Deep grief': The trainee accountant's father Raymond Hicks said the family will 'never recover' from Alice's death . Lucy Fulford, a passenger in anther . car driving in the opposite direction, said: The speed shocked me. I saw . the driver, he looked panicked. His arms were rigid and his eyes were . wide. I smelt rubber.' Miss Hicks suffered head injuries after being thrown from the car and died the next day. After Day was found guilty Miss Hicks' mother Yvonne, 59, a receptionist, described her daughter as 'the centre of the family'. She said: 'We . all miss her terribly, she was the centre of our lives, she did so much . for us all. We now need to think of all the happy times that we all had together.' Her father Raymond, 79, added: 'We are . pleased that Daniel Day, who drove Alice to her death, has received . punishment for the way in which he drove her car. 'Nothing . will replace her and we will never recover from losing her in a . completely unnecessary accident caused by his criminally irresponsible . driving. 'It’s about . time that UK law recognised that a motor vehicle in the hands of an . irresponsible driver is as lethal as a gun or knife.' Miss . Hicks' father added that his daughter had been months away from . graduating from an accountancy course at Weston College in . Weston-super-Mare. The retired BT national sales training manager said: 'She died in the September but was due to graduate the following June. 'I had saved my cap and gown for her and she was going to wear it to the ceremony. It is still laid out on her bed.' Tragedy: The trial heard Day approached the blind bend in his girlfriend's convertible Mini Cooper at up to 80mph (file photo) In a letter to Recorder Jeremy Wright, Day expressed his remorse and said: 'I will never forgive myself'. In . excerpts read out by the judge, he said: 'I have so much guilt and no . respect for myself. I have brought terrible suffering to her family and . shame to my family.' Mr Hicks said he believes swifter action should be taken against dangerous drivers. 'Where . responsibility is clear the individual should be arrested immediately, . and their driving licence and passport removed,' he said. 'While . all Alice’s family were suffering in deep grief, particularly on the . anniversary of her death and over two Christmases, Daniel Day was . allowed to spend the time in the bosom of his family.

        "document": "XENIA, Ohio (CNN) -- \"It's the magic of dogs.\" Karen Shirk's nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability has placed 319 service dogs with people with disabilities since 1998. That's how Karen Shirk explains the ability of service dogs to help children suffering from autism. \"I'm sure there's some sort of scientific explanation,\" she says. \"But I call it magic.\" Since 1998, through her nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability, Shirk has helped partner service dogs with people with a wide range of disabilities. It was Shirk's own challenge in getting a service dog that led her to start 4 Paws. In the late 1980s, while employed as a social worker in the field of mental retardation and autism, Shirk suddenly went into respiratory arrest. She was hospitalized off and on until 1992, when she was finally diagnosed with a rare neuromuscular disease. Confined to a wheelchair and reliant on a respirator, Shirk set out to get a service dog so she could be more independent -- but agencies turned her down, saying she was too disabled for a dog to make a difference in her life. Frustrated, Shirk eventually decided to obtain a dog on her own. She found Ben, a black German shepherd puppy that, with the help of a trainer, became her service dog. With Ben by her side, Shirk regained a sense of optimism and control over her life. \"He gave me a reason to get up in the morning,\" Shirk remembers. \"I went from existing to living.\" Knowing there must be others like her, Shirk started 4 Paws in her apartment to help people who've been told they're ineligible to get a service dog. \"We don't discriminate against anyone who has a need,\" she says. Since many agencies have age restrictions, she now specializes in providing dogs to children. The dogs help kids with a variety of issues, from mobility problems to seizures, but from the start Shirk wanted to find ways to assist children with autism. \"I knew [autistic children] connected to animals,\" she remembers. \"I knew that service dogs would be able to help.\" She developed a program to train autism assistance dogs, and of the 319 dogs she's placed since 1998, nearly 70 percent have been partnered with autistic children. \"The biggest problem that's faced by families that have children with autism is isolation. They actually quit going out because they can't keep their child safe,\" says Shirk. Shirk's service dogs are taught a variety of methods to help keep kids with autism safe. Since many children tend to wander away and get lost, 4 Paws uses a technique called \"tethering,\" where the kids are tethered to their dogs while in public. The parent -- who always holds the leash -- ultimately remains in control of both the dog and the child. Many dogs are even trained to track children who stray from home by following their scent.  Watch a mother talk about the importance of her autistic son's 4 Paws service dog » . Shirk says service dogs also give autistic children valuable emotional support. They're taught to intervene when a child is frustrated, reducing tantrums commonly known as \"meltdowns.\" But Shirk believes one of the most important benefits is that the dogs are companions to kids who are often isolated. \"For our children with autism, their dog might be the only friend that they have.\"  Watch Shirk explain the powerful impact service dogs can have on autistic children » . Shirk's 4 Paws for Ability requires that families raise $12,000, on average, to pay for their service dog. Each dog is trained for the child's specific needs, and the entire process takes between nine and 18 months. In the end, families come to Ohio to meet their dogs and receive training. For Shirk, seeing the kids bond with their dogs makes her efforts worthwhile.  Watch how Shirk partners service dogs with children with disabilities » . \"I love to see their faces and know that I was a part of that,\" Shirk says. \"It makes me feel good.\"",

        "document": "By . Joshua Gardner . A woman who lost her arms as an infant in Kolkata when her 11-year-old mother attempted to end both of their lives by standing in front of an oncoming train in a murder-suicide attempt is now a happily married mother in Las Vegas. The incredible journey of Shanthi Kimball began tragically in poverty but her sad course was reversed just a year later when a Mormon family from Montana adopted her and raised her as their own. Now Kimball is raising two boys with her husband Conrad with the help of her unbelievably skilled feet, which she uses to do everything, from changing diapers to driving. New beginnings: Shanthi Kimball with her husband, Conrad, has managed to overcome a tough start in life after losing both arms when her 11-year-old mother tried to end both their lives . Hope: Shanthi had to have both arms amputated, but an American family later adopted her from an Indian orphanage . 'It actually hasn’t been that hard because it’s normal for me,' Kimball said told Deseret News. Her life has taken her from the streets of some of the world's most depressed slums to a joyful religious life in a gleaming American city. It all began when she was found beside some train tracks at two months old. Her arms had been severed from her body. Nearby were the remains of her 11-year-old mother. Baby Shanthi was taken to an orphanage, where she would wait 11 months before finally being adopted by a Mormon couple, though even for the deeply faithful Montana couple it wasn't an easy decision. Her mother Karen first saw her in a pamphlet that showed pictures of some of India's homeless or abandoned children. 'I quickly told her that she didn't know what she was talking about, I meant the hardship of raising a child with a handicap such as that. Karen quickly said, that doesn't matter and she was meant to be our daughter, but I quickly said no again, Shanthi's adoptive father Bruce wrote in his journal. Tough start: Despite having to learn to overcome her disability, Shanthi thrived as a loved member of her adopted family . However, he soon found himself having a change of heart after reading a passage of scripture in the Bible's book of Matthew. 'When I read that passage it struck me with much force that Shanthi was the child ordained in heaven to be our daughter, and that I was denying her, and I would be held accountable if I denied her any longer,' Bruce wrote. Shanthi arrived in the United States when she was 13 months old and began her new life. 'I always felt part of the family,' said Shanthi, who would eventually have a total of eight siblings, six of whom were adopted. Her journey toward adulthood would be paved with one amazing accomplishment after the next. She learned to draw and paint with her feet, according to LDSmag.com, and even went on to receive an art degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Strong: Mom-of-two Shanthi has learned to use her feet to do the work of her hands, including changing diapers . She met her husband and the father of her two sons, Conrad, at the LDS singles ward she was attending while a student at UNLV. And the rest is heartwarming history thanks to adoption, prayer, and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 'I am just grateful for the opportunity to be a mother, and I don’t harbor any resentment for what my [birth] mother did,' said Shanthi. 'She was just a child herself. I don’t know what the circumstances were, but I’m sure in the next life I will receive all the answers to the questions I have.'",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Two cousins have been convicted of kidnapping a gay man in Kentucky, but the Justice Department failed in the same case to win a guilty verdict in the first test of an expanded hate crimes provision covering sexual orientation. The jury verdict on Wednesday against David Jason Jenkins, 37, and Anthony Ray Jenkins, 20, of Harlan County stemmed from an April 2011 kidnapping of Kevin Pennington, 29, who managed to escape, according an indictment. The men planned to assault Pennington because of his sexual orientation, the indictment said in part. But a federal jury in Laurel County acquitted them of committing a hate crime. Federal hate crimes law was expanded in 2009 to include a victim's perceived sexual orientation, gender or disability. It was named for Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Both men were attacked and killed in separate incidents in 1998 that drew national attention to toughening hate crimes laws broadly. Shepard was gay and Byrd was killed in a racially motivated attack. He was black. Although the government failed to convict the Kentucky men on hate crime charges this week, the Justice Department's top civil rights official, Thomas Perez, said prosecutors would not be discouraged from bringing other cases. Perez called the kidnapping a \"vicious and criminal act\" and said his department would vigorously investigate possible hate crimes. Two female relatives of the Jenkins' cousins pleaded guilty soon after the incident to related charges.",

A mother may have to withdraw her disabled daughter from school because the local council axed her free taxi transport when she received a wheelchair. Casey Williams, five, from Preston, Lancashire, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year and was provided with free transport to take her to and from school. But her mother Sarah Williams claims that since Casey now has a wheelchair, Lancashire County Council have said she no longer qualifies for free transport to Blessed Sacrament Catholic Primary School. The 32-year-old used to carry Casey to school or push her in a buggy until she got too heavy - but when she fell pregnant again she could no longer lift the youngster. And since giving birth to seven-week-old baby Kaylen, the mother-of-four finds it impossible to manage her daughter's wheelchair and a pushchair on the 0.7 mile journey. Ms William's mother has volunteered to look after her baby grandson every morning while her daughter tackles the school run with Casey and her two older children. But the single mother, who is appealing the ruling, said that if she loses she will have no choice but to keep the youngster off school. She said: 'After school I have to rely on my eight-year-old pushing the baby in the pram so I can push the wheelchair. 'And that isn't fair on her - it means she can't go to any after school clubs or anything like that because I need her help. 'I can't keep relying on my mum.' By law, councils are required to provide transport for primary school children who live more than two miles from their nearest available school. Ms Williams said the county council allocated Casey a free taxi for the journey until the end of the school term in July while the family were waiting for a wheelchair. But when she contacted the authorities before the start of the new academic year she was told Casey didn't meet criteria. Casey, pictured left and right at home,  was initially provided with free transport to and from school, but this was stopped when she received a wheelchair . She said: 'If I didn't have a newborn I wouldn't be asking for help at all - but I can't push them both to school. Casey is too big now.' Phil Huddart, Lancashire County Council's school transport manager, said: 'We don't discuss individual cases in detail because of confidentiality. These cases are often more complicated than they appear and we are still awaiting the outcome of a further appeal. 'We can offer help with school transport under certain circumstances although assessments must always focus on the needs of the individual child, not the situation of other family members. 'To qualify for transport help, children are also expected to attend the nearest suitable school to where they live. This map shows the nearly one mile route the two must make twice a day to get Casey to school and back . Casey must now be pushed to and from Blessed Sacrament Catholic Primary School (pictured) everyday . The five-year-old was diagnosed with cerebral palsy last year but her mother is struggling to get her to school . 'When an appeal is made it is a chance for both sides to look at the situation afresh and consider any alternatives which may be appropriate.' Mr William's father Keith Williams, 56, said: 'I think it is absolutely disgusting really that we have to go through all of this to get a taxi for a child with a disability. 'We are appealing the decision at the moment but we have to wait until the beginning of October to find out whether she will be granted the free transport or not. 'But in the mean time it is a real struggle for Sarah as she has three other children and she can't push the wheelchair and the baby's pram. 'No one from the council has been out to assess Casey - they have just said she doesn't fit their criteria, but every child with cerebral palsy is different. 'It is a bad day when you have to go through all of this. The whole situation makes me really angry.'",

A man has survived a horrific car crash which left him with 42 fractures in his face - after it smashed into the steering wheel. Sam Fretwell needed reconstructed eye sockets, was left blind in one eye and needed metal plates fitted in his face. Mr Fretwell , 22, from Eakring, Nottinghamshire, was driving on the A614 in May last year when he was involved in a 50mph collision with another car while wearing a seatbelt. Sam Fretwell, 22, was involved in a 50mph car crash. He said: 'When I hit my head on the steering wheel, it knocked me out straight away but I am told I had crushed my nose, which had slipped down about two inches and the cartilage had burst out of my skin. I had smashed my face to bits' Mr Fretwell was driving on the A614 when a car came from a side junction and smashed into him at 50mph.

The force of the impact sent Mr Fretwell’s face into the steering wheel effectively breaking it in half. He was left with life threatening injuries and was rushed by air ambulance to Nottingham University Hospital, where he underwent life-saving operations and 13-hour reconstructive surgery to piece his face back together. Mr Fretwell said: ‘When I hit my head on the steering wheel, it knocked me out straight away but I am told I had crushed my nose, which had slipped down about two inches and the cartilage had burst out of my skin. ‘I had smashed my face to bits. ‘My left cheek had turned to cornflakes and my eye sockets on both sides had to be replaced with wire meshing and from my jaw joints to my cheekbones is now titanium plating. ‘My ear also had to be sewn back on.’ Mr Fretwell said: ‘My left cheek had turned to cornflakes and my eye sockets on both sides had to be replaced with wire meshing.'

He said: ‘I was so lucky they were there to call for help, I remember lying on my back in the side of the road unable to do anything.’ Mr Fretwell has praised the work of the air ambulance, and credits their swift work to saving his life.He said: ‘The only thing I remember from being in the air ambulance is the estimated time of arrival which was seven minutes. ‘If we had been going by road it would have taken another hour on top of that to get to the hospital. It saved my life.’ Mr Fretwell was treated at the Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, for his injuries which included a broken sternum, a punctured lung, blindness in one eye and 42 fractures in his face.

        "document": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected by bosses, figures show. Despite rules giving parents equal rights to ask for family-friendly hours, almost one in five men are rebuffed by employers. Labour blamed ‘cultural barriers’ which mean firms still see looking after children as the responsibility of mothers, with men expected to work full-time. Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected . Figures released in Parliament show how men, people in their forties and northerners are more likely to have requests rejected. It also reveals how men are much less likely to even bother asking their boss for to work flexibly. In 2012, 18 per cent of men who asked for flexible working were turned down, compared to 10 per cent of women. Labour shadow children's minister Lucy Powell said dads feel short-changed by employers . Only 17 per cent of fathers even ask to change their hours compared to 28 per cent of women. It comes as a new report shows younger dads aged between 26 and 35 are the most resentful towards their employers about their work-life balance. Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow children’s minister, said: ‘Childcare is not just an issue for mums. ‘These figures show that dads are getting a raw deal when trying to balance work and family. ‘Today, dads need a modern workplace and family-friendly policies and practices so they can get on at work as well as having time to be with their kids.’ The figures from the Department for Work and Pensions also reveal people are more likely to be turned down for flexible leave depending on their age or where they live. People in their forties are most likely to be rejected (18 per cent) compared to 12 per cent for 16-39-year-olds and 11 per cent of over-50s. People in the Midlands were least likely to be rebuffed (8 per cent) compared to 14 per cent in the south of England and 16 per cent in the north. As the law stands parents with children aged 16 or under, those with disabled children under 18, and carers of adults have the right to apply for a flexible working pattern. Data released to Parliament shows how men are more likely than women to have requests for flexible working turned down . Miss Powell added: ‘While women still face a glass ceiling to get back and get on in work, many dads face other cultural barriers to being able to flexibly including working long hours, inflexible organisational culture and expectations that men should be the main breadwinner. ‘This generation of dads feels short-changed by employers and the system. We know having more dads involved in childcare and home life is good for children but this should benefit employers too, making their employees happier and less resentful. Policy and practice needs to change to give more opportunities to fathers.’ A BIS spokesman said: 'We are extending the right to request flexible working to all employees from this year. 'By allowing everyone to work flexibly, we want to remove the cultural assumption that flexible working is only for women, or just for parents and carers. 'We want these reforms to bring about a culture change in Britain's workplaces, allowing everyone to better balance work with their personal life through jobs shares, part-time working or working from home. 'The current system for maternity and paternity leave has not kept up with the times, so in 2015 we're introducing shared parental leave and pay, which will allow working couples to choose how they share care for their child in the first year after birth. It will allow men to play a more active role in childcare and family responsibilities, and women to return to work sooner if they wish to.'",

        "document": "Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A once-celebrated Japanese composer who last week confessed his works were written by a ghostwriter, and subsequently had doubt cast on his claim to be deaf, now admits at least partially faking his hearing loss. Mamoru Samuragochi, until recently hailed as a \"Japanese Beethoven\" for composing hit symphonies despite claiming to have been completely deaf for 15 years, made the admission in a handwritten apology sent to news organizations through his lawyers. \"I apologize from the bottom of my heart for betraying and hurting many people,\" he wrote, in his first public statement addressing the allegations about his hearing. In a televised press conference last week, a Tokyo music teacher named Takashi Niigaki revealed that he had secretly been the real composer of Samuragochi's works for 18 years. He also expressed doubt over the composer's claims of deafness -- central to his romantic public image as a genius who \"felt\" music he could not hear -- saying that Samuragochi had conversed with him normally, and provided critiques on the music he contracted him to write over the years. \"I've never felt he was deaf ever since we met,\" he said. READ MORE: Uproar as 'Japanese Beethoven' exposed as fraud . In his written statement, Samuragochi, who is yet to publicly front over the scandal, said that he had been deaf, but in the past three years had recovered a degree of hearing. \"It has recovered to an extent where I could sometimes grasp words when someone speaks clearly and slowly close to my ears, though it sounds muffled and skewed,\" he wrote. Stating that he planned to apologize to the public in person soon, Samuragochi added that he was prepared to have his hearing medically tested, and would forfeit his government-issued disability certificate if found ineligible. The eight-page letter also contained apologies to tsunami victims, for whom his most famous symphony had become an important symbol of resilience, and to Japanese Olympic figure skater Daisuke Takahashi, who planned to perform to another ghostwritten work in Sochi. Takahashi takes to the ice Thursday, and the Japanese Skating Federation has said that while the score will be used, the composer's name will be omitted from the program. \"I am deeply ashamed of living a life of lies,\" said Samuragochi's statement. Samuragochi claimed to rely on his perfect pitch to compose his hit symphonies, movie scores and video game soundtracks after losing his hearing, telling TIME magazine in a 2001 interview that \"if you trust your inner sense of sound, you create something that is truer... Losing my hearing was a gift from God.\" When confessing that a ghostwriter had been involved in composing his most famous works, he claimed that he had provided the broader ideas for the music, while the collaborator had produced the finished scores. But Niigaki said he did not believe Samuragochi was even capable of writing musical scores, and had threatened to kill himself if their arrangement was exposed.",

Greg Plitt, the bodybuilding model who was killed by a train while filming a sports advert video in LA, was allegedly trying to outrun it when he was struck . Plitt, among the more recognizable faces and physiques in the fitness industry, was shooting a video for his website with two crew members . His girlfriend Christina Stejskal told the LA Times he was 'just trying to get the best shot.' 'He wanted to push things to the limit,' said a weeping Stejskal in an interview Monday. 'He's just like Superman.' On Monday Metrolink officials told the LA Times that Plitt and his film crew did not have permission to be on the commuter railroad's right-of-way. 'He had no permit to be there,' said Jeff Lustgarten, a Metrolink spokesman. 'We have a whole process for people to go through if they want to be on our right-of-way, especially for film crews.' Previous workout videos featuring Plitt have shown him working out along train tracks next to rolling trains . Physique: Plitt was considered a model for aspiring bodybuilders and fitness junkies, racking up millions of views on his Youtube videos . Warren Coulter, who had been friends for 15 years with 37-year-old George Gregory Plitt Jr., who went by 'Greg' said: 'It was just a freaky moment where something got out of control.' Coulter told The Associated Press that Plitt was a West Point graduate and Army Ranger who had jumped out of planes more than 1,000 times in his life and had a taste for the extreme, but also treated everyone and everything with respect and care as befitted his military past. 'Everything Greg did, he did extremely well,' Coulter said. 'This isn't anyone who ever took a nap.' Coulter said he spoke to members of the film crew and says Plitt misjudged the situation and tripped and fell before he was hit by the train. 'No question of it, it was just a mistake,' Coulter said. Investigators have ruled out a suicide, and were trying to determine who directed the men to film without a permit in a restricted area of the tracks Saturday afternoon. They have interviewed witnesses who saw Plitt standing on the track even as the train's horn was blaring, Burbank police Sgt. Scott Meadows said. Plitt, a native of Baltimore who settled in Los Angeles more than 10 years ago, appeared on more than 200 magazine covers, Bravo's reality television shows 'Work Out' and 'Friends to Lovers' and NBC's daytime soap opera 'Days of Our Lives,' according to his personal website. A motivational video on the website shows Plitt working out on the tracks as a Metrolink train passes by. Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said Monday that the Los Angeles-region commuter train system tries to warn people when it sees they have posted images or videos of themselves on its tracks, but he didn't know whether Plitt had been contacted in the past. Walking on tracks is trespassing, Johnson said. 'The tracks are for one thing — trains,' he said. It appears Plitt may have believed the train was on a nearby, parallel track, Meadows said. 'It's like a blind turn,' he said. 'When the train came, you might not be able to tell which set the train is on.'",

        "document": "By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 05:33 EST, 18 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:22 EST, 18 July 2012 . Brave new world: Yokamon Hearn, 33, became the first Texas prisoner to be executed under the state's new single-drug lethal injection procedure . A Texas prisoner who murdered a 23-year-old stockbroker in 1998 has just become the first to be executed under the U.S. state's new single-drug lethal injection procedure. Yokamon Hearn, 33, who shot Frank Meziere ten times before dumping his body on the side of the road, was executed Wednesday night in Huntsville, Texas. Hearn was the sixth prisoner executed in Texas this year, but the first since the Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced its switch to single-drug lethal injections amid a drug shortage that has left states in the U.S. scrambling for acceptable alternatives. It was announced last week that Texas would use a single dose of pentobarbital as a lethal injection, instead of using the sedative in combination with two other drugs as before. Ohio became the first state to use a single drug a year ago, and several other states have since made the switch. Last rites: The death chamber inside the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, where Yokamon Hearn was executed Wednesday evening . Courts have upheld the practice, despite the reaction of death penalty opponents who claim that prisoners take longer to die with a single drug. Hearn - known to his friends as Yogi - had made appeals against his sentence based on his mental capacity, the competence of his lawyers, and whether recent lower federal court rulings improperly blocked his current legal team from pursuing appeals. In 2004, a federal court spared Hearn less than an hour before he could have been taken to the death chamber, so that it could consider arguments that he was mentally impaired and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. That appeal was subsequently rejected. More recently Hearn's lawyers told the U.S. Supreme Court that, while tests show Hearn's IQ is considerably higher than levels determining mental impairment, he suffers from a fetal alcohol disorder that should disqualify him from execution. Jason January, the former Dallas . County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Hearn for capital . murder, dismissed claims that the 33-year-old was disabled. 'He was quite capable of functioning and figuring out how to rob people,' he said. Hearn was 19 at the time of Meziere's murder and had a lengthy criminal record that included burglary, robbery, assault, sexual assault and possession of weapons. The Texas State Penitentiary is following the lead of prisons in other U.S. states by switching to the single-drug lethal injection method . Meziere was abducted at gunpoint as he was cleaning his car at a self-service car wash in Dallas. A security camera video at a convenience store next to the car wash captured images of Hearn with two other Dallas men and a woman from Oklahoma City. They had been out looking for someone to carjack, authorities said. According to trial testimony, Hearn and Delvin Diles forced Meziere into the stockbroker's car, and Hearn drove it to an area near Dallas' wastewater treatment plant. The two others, Dwight Burley and Teresa Shirley, followed in a second car. Meziere, from Plano, was shot with a stolen, assault-style rifle and then with a .22-caliber pistol. Shirley testified that Hearn shot Meziere with the rifle and then continued to fire after he hit the ground. Diles then shot him with the pistol. She also testified that Hearn later waved around a newspaper account of the crime and was pleased it said Meziere had been shot in the head, or 'domed' in street slang. According to The Dallas Morning News, Hearn told her: 'I told you I domed him. I told you. I told you.' Diles, 19 at the time, pleaded guilty and received consecutive life terms for Meziere's death and an unrelated aggravated robbery. Shirley, 19, and Burley, then 20, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received 10-year prison sentences. Hearn beame the 483rd inmate executed since Texas resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. He is among at least nine men with execution dates in the coming months.",

Stewart Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after targeting elderly, disabled and blind victims . A heartless conman scoured neighbourhoods for the most elderly and vulnerable people so that he could fleece them of their savings and valuables, a court heard. Stewart Marshall kept notes of the names and addresses of targets alongside descriptions such as ‘nutty old bat’, ‘Mrs disabled’ and ‘Mr has Alzheimer’s’. Posing as a builder, he offered them home improvement work that was either not done at all or carried out to a poor standard. The victims, who had an average age of around 90, handed over thousands of pounds while one woman was persuaded to give up her wedding, engagement and eternity rings. Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after being branded ‘mean, selfish and greedy’ by the judge. He was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to burgle over a two-year period and converting criminal property. The court heard Marshall, of Wyke, Bradford, went cold-calling with his ‘conman’s kit’ of bogus identification cards and badges. He scouted residential areas for the easiest prey and tricked his way into the homes of very elderly people with dementia, mobility problems and blindness. Marshall, 44, pretended to be a builder, but in reality was a cruel conman and heroin addict who used much of the cash to buy drugs. Judge John Potter said Marshall primarily ‘extorted’ money from victims. The first victim was Maurice Lobley, 81, who suffered from dementia and was targeted weeks before his death in September 2011. He paid £15,000 for building work on a driveway and £7,000 for a single window. Widow Joan Cottam, 90, issued eight cheques worth more than £11,000 to replace windows that did not need any work. Mrs Cottam said that a man involved in the work persuaded her to hand over her wedding, engagement and eternity rings. Marshall stole the jewellery of another victim, Amy Roper, 94, who is partially blind and disabled, while he pretended to check a water leak. Judge John Potter told Marshall: 'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed,' as he sentenced him to a stint behind bars at Bradford Crown Court, pictured . Frank Perkins, 66, who is wheelchair-bound, had a wallet containing £115 stolen. In . June this year Marshall was put under surveillance by police. He . visited an 89-year-old partially-sighted woman who gave him £30 to tidy . her garden, only for officers to film him rolling tin foil ‘consistent . with a drug addict getting a fix’. Passing . sentence, Judge Potter said Marshall had not shown a ‘shred of remorse’ and added: ‘The premises were targeted on the basis of their occupants . being vulnerable or elderly and all were in their homes when you stole . from them. 'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed.’ After . the case Mr Lobley’s son David said: ‘I hope his sentence acts as a . deterrent to others who might be thinking of attempting the same thing. There is no place in society for people like that and I am glad he has . been taken out of it.’ Detective . Constable Sean Donoghue urged people to only allow doorstep callers . into their property if they are sure of their identity.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- The number of women competing in the Paralympic Games has doubled in the last two decades, according to figures released by the International Paralympic Committee. While at the 1992 Barcelona Games only 700 female athletes were involved in events, London will see a record-breaking 1,513 female paralympians take the stage across 18 sports. Tine Teilman, Chairperson of the IPC Women in Sport Committee which helps to raise the profile and involvement of women in Paralympic Sport, said: \"It is very encouraging that the number of female participants in the Paralympic Games has doubled during the last 20 years. \"I am sure we will see many sportswomen through inspiring and exiting performances become strong role models for others.\" CNN has put together a list of eight inspirational women competing in the London 2012 Paralympics. Tatyana McFadden @TatyanaMcFadden . Country: United States . Event: Athletics . McFadden, 23, an eight-time world champion and Paralympics multi-medal winner, . She was born with spina bifida, which left her paralyzed from the waist down. She spent the first six years of her life in a St Petersburg orphanage -- where she walked her hands because she didn't have a wheelchair -- before being adopted a visiting American. At 15, she qualified for the Athens games in wheelchair racing as the youngest member of the track and field team. It was her first international competition and she shocked everyone by winning a silver and a bronze. Four years later in Beijing, she picked up three silvers and a bronze. McFadden races in category T54 events, which are among those for athletes who race or throw from a seated position. Paralympic athletics classifications group competitors into classes that allow them to compete against those with similar impairments. This time she'll be competing in five T54 racing events: 100m, 400m, 800m, 1,500m and the women's marathon. Finally after three Paralympics Games attempts, McFadden won her first gold on day five in London in the 400m T54 race. Sarah Storey @MrsSarahStorey . Country: Great Britain . Event: Cycling . The 33-year-old Briton, who was born without fingers on her left hand after her arm was caught in her umbilical cord in the womb, has already picked up two gold medals in track cycling at these games. Storey began her distinguished Olympic career as a swimmer, picking up two golds, three silvers and a bronze in Barcelona in 1992. She swam at the Paralympics in Atlanta, Sydney and Athens adding 10 more medals to her tally. She switched to cycling in time for the Beijing games, following a serious ear infection in Athens. She could bag two more medals before the games are over in road cycling, but her success has already been immortalized on a postage stamp issued by the UK's Royal Mail. Jessica Long @JessicaLong . Country: United States . Event: Swimming . At just 20 years old, Long is already a veteran paralympian. Long, who was born without any fibulas, ankles or heels and had both legs amputated below the knee at 18 months, began training in her grandparents' pool at the age of 10. She began her professional career aged 12 at the Athens games in 2004. The youngest member of the team, she wowed the crowds by taking home three gold medals. Four years later in Beijing, the gold rush continued: She won four golds, a silver and a bronze. Long is continuing her extraordinary run this games, winning gold in all three events she has so far competed in, with six more to go. Esther Vergeer @EstherVergeer . Country: Netherlands . Event: Wheelchair Tennis . There is little doubt about who the hot seed is in women's wheelchair tennis. World number one, Esther Vergeer, 31, has dominated the sport for the last three games. Not to mention her remarkable streak of 465 unbeaten singles matches, which spans almost a decade. Vergeer developed paraplegia when she was eight years old, following spinal surgery. During rehabilitation, she learned to play wheelchair tennis. In 2000, two years after she made her international debut, Vergeer won a place on the Dutch paralympic team for the Sydney games and went on to win two gold medals. She repeated her impressive accomplishment at Athens in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008, she won gold in the singles event and silver in the doubles. Last year she told Athlete magazine: \"If you don't try, it will never happen.\" A motto she appears to have taken to heart. Alexandra Rickham @ARickham . Country: Great Britain . Event: Sailing . Rickham was left paralysed after a diving accident in Jamaica. Ten years later, while studying in London, she tried her hand at sailing and fell in love with the sport. In 2007, she joined forces with fellow GB sailor Niki Birrell and the duo have gone on to win four world titles in a row in the two-person keelboat discipline. They placed a disappointing 5th at the Beijing games and this time round they are determined to bag a medal in the waters off Weymouth. April Holmes @aprilholmes . Country: United States . Event: Athletics . A Beijing gold medal-winner, Holmes has already picked up a bronze in London. Holmes' left leg was amputated below the knee following a train accident, and she mainly competes in T44 sprint events, for athletes who have an impairment that affects their arms or legs. Now 39, Holmes won a bronze medal in the long jump in Athens and winning her Beijing gold in the T44 100 meters race. She will be hoping for a gold in the T44 200 meters, after all, she once said: \"Someone has to be great. Why not me?\" Sarai Gascon @saraigascon . Country: Spain . Event: Swimming . The Spanish 19-year-old is a hot contender to take the place of celebrated South African paralympic swimmer, Natalie du Toit -- who will retire following London 2012. Gascon was born without a left hand or forearm, but took delight in getting in the water from the age of three. By nine, she had started competing internationally and took silver at the Beijing Paralympics when she was 15 years old. Last year at the European Championships, she won seven medals, but du Toit was not competing at the event and has already taken a gold from Gascon at these games -- in the Women's 100m Butterfly S9 class, for swimmers with physical impairments. A recent tweet from Gascon shows the elation a paralympian feels after winning a medal. She writes: \"So happy! Silver medal with European record! :D Very happy for my \"xico?\" @josemari88 for 4th place medal!!\" Gascon will have plenty more opportunities to take gold -- she's competing in six more races. Jessica Gallagher @JessGallagher86 . Country: Australia . Event: Long Jump, Javelin Throw . An impressive sporting all-rounder, Jess Gallagher set herself some even more impressive goals for London 2012. She is the first and only Australian woman to win a medal After winning Australia's first Paralympic Winter Games gold medal in 2010 in Vancouver, where she won the vision-impaired slalom, she is aiming to be the first Australian to win medals in both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games. Gallagher, who was told at 17 that she was losing her sight, has so far come 6th in the javelin and so will setting her sights firmly on success in the long jump.

        "document": "By ANNA MAGEE . PUBLISHED: . 06:10 EST, 5 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:05 EST, 5 June 2012 . When martial arts teacher Sandra Beale-Ellis discovered one of the children in her class had Asperger’s syndrome, she set out to discover more about the condition. ‘I’d seen the film Rain Man, but that was the extent of my knowledge about autism,’ says Sandra, 44, who lives in Herne Bay, Kent. ‘So I bought a book about Asperger’s to read up about it.’ Autism is a developmental disability causing difficulties with communication and relating to other people. Undiagnosed: Teacher Sandra Beale-Ellis was surprised to recognise some of the traits of Asperger's in her husband, Joe . Asperger’s is a ‘high-functioning’ form of the condition, where sufferers often have very high IQs. Learning about its classic characteristics — social awkwardness, a love of detail and repetition, and a tendency for obsessions and collecting — Sandra was surprised  to recognise some of the traits in her husband, Joe, 50. Joe, who is the founder of Kent Karate Schools, a string of martial arts academies in Kent, owns hundreds of salt shakers he  has been collecting since he was ten, which sit in neat rows in their house. He is also obsessed with castles and runs an online tearoom review site. Sandra grew more interested, and signed up for a postgraduate certificate in Asperger’s. That was when the lightbulb moment came. Recognisable traits: The film Rain Man, pictured, was the extent of Sandra's knowledge about autism - until she realised her husband had it . ‘One of my tutors said people with autism and Asperger’s often have sensitivity to light, touch, colour or taste,’ says Sandra. ‘Joe hates clothes against his skin and would strip off to his T-shirt and underwear the minute he got home, even in winter. He hates the colour red and bright lights. I’d always called them Joe-isms. Now I realised they were signs of Asperger’s.’ Joe was sceptical, but after two years of persuasion, he saw a psychologist and after a three-hour interview he was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s. But, incredibly, there was more to come. Though Asperger’s is significantly more common in men than women, as Sandra sat in on Joe’s interview she felt pangs of recognition. ‘It was like a checklist of my own past,’ she says. ‘Like Joe, I love detail, order and lists. ‘I was in the top group for most subjects at school, but I didn’t understand fashion or dolls or boyfriends, so was often left in the corner with my book. I didn’t have any friends.’ In the two years after Joe’s diagnosis, several people on the postgraduate course asked Sandra if she thought she, too, might have Asperger’s. Sure enough, in October 2010, she had a day-long interview with psychologists and was also found to have the condition. ‘I left the interview and burst into tears,’ she says. ‘I went from feeling upset to angry to confused and sat there crying my eyes out.’ Big issue: There is a lack of understanding among GPs in spotting autism, meaning a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems (file picture) According to the National Austistic Society (NAS), one in 100 adults has a form of autism. There are 225,000 adults living with Asperger’s, most of whom don’t know they have it because they can get by in mainstream life and hold down jobs. While autism was first described by psychologist Leo Kanner 50 years ago, Asperger’s wasn’t recognised in Britain until 1994. As a result, psychologists suspect the vast majority of undiagnosed adult autism cases will be those with Asperger’s who grew up before the disorder was identified. ‘By now, we are getting the diagnosis of severe autism right,’ says Dr Linda Buchan, consultant psychiatrist at the Sheffield Asperger’s Syndrome Service. ‘But adults with Asperger’s are slipping through the net because their symptoms are subtle and they may get by on their intelligence. That doesn’t mean they’re not secretly going through hell.’ The consequences of having Asperger’s and not knowing it can be severe. ‘People can develop depression and panic attacks or what psychologists call meltdowns. That’s where those with Asperger’s use so much energy to act normally that they end up exhausted and unable to get out of bed for days. Even a small change in plans can shake them.’ A recent report by the National Audit Office found eight out of ten doctors admitted they didn’t have enough knowledge or training in autism. ‘There is a lack of understanding among GPs in spotting autism,’ says Sarah Lambert, head of policy at the NAS. ‘As a result, a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems.’ Indeed, when Sandra persuaded Joe to see his GP he was met with dismissal. ‘He said to Joe: “Why do you want to know? You’re successful, married, what’s the point?” He didn’t believe adults with autism even existed,’ she says. But Joe’s diagnosis was a great relief, not least because it explained his sudden, unexplained rages that had plagued their relationship since the couple met and fell in love 21 years ago. Of the 500,000 adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder, of which Asperger’s is a part, 80 per cent are men. As is common with many of them, Joe’s condition manifested itself as an anger problem. ‘Joe would lose his temper for the strangest reasons,’ says Sandra. ‘He never hurt me, but his language was hurtful and we had plenty of broken furniture and holes in the walls. ‘In the first few months there were moments when I thought about walking out. ‘Joe’s family have a history of mental illness and I wondered at first if perhaps he suffered from bipolar disorder. But we were so connected from the very beginning that I couldn’t seriously think about being without him. ‘Eventually, we worked out his triggers — tiredness, hunger and stress,’ says Sandra. ‘We arranged our lives so the triggers didn’t happen. The house was always impeccably organised and I stopped wearing red.’ Because Asperger’s in adults is largely undiagnosed, many people may be married to someone with the condition and be unaware of it, suffering rows that could have been avoided with a diagnosis, says Dr Buchan. ‘People with Asperger’s struggle with emotional displays, so their partners often interpret their behaviour as uncaring and undemonstrative. They may find it important to stick to plans and timetables, often becoming upset when their partners want to do something spontaneous.’ In women, Asperger’s symptoms can manifest as extreme passivity or anxiety, says Dr Judith Gould, consultant psychologist and director of the Lorna Wing Centre for Autism in Kent. Sandra had always been the calm one in the marriage. ‘I didn’t have Joe’s temper, but suffered from nervous anxiety instead,’ she says. ‘Women are much better at masking their symptoms, so Asperger’s can be misinterpreted as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, shyness, anxiety or even an eating disorder because sufferers may develop obsessions with calorie counting or exercise.’ While it may seem a coincidence that Sandra and Joe both have the condition, Keith Lovett of charity Autism UK Independent says: ‘People with Asperger’s have been known to enter relationships with each another. ‘This may be because the lack of social interaction and cues between them make for a mutual understanding, but there is no scientific evidence proving a link.’ There is no medication or treatment for autism or Asperger’s, but those diagnosed benefit from care, support and therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to help everyday functioning and training in social skills. For Sandra, Joe’s diagnosis  had a positive impact on her life. ‘I no longer feel to blame for Joe’s rages and feel in control of what is going on,’ she says. Joe agrees. ‘I realised it wasn’t that I had a rotten temper, but the Asperger’s was affecting my behaviour,’ he says. ‘I have learned to control it and when I feel a meltdown or rage coming, I have time alone or listen to music to calm down.’ Sandra specialises in teaching martial arts to children with autism. ‘Being diagnosed has helped my teaching,’ she says. ‘I can identify with what the children are going through and parents are more willing to open up to me and accept my advice.’ She has learned to love the fact she and her husband are just a little different. ‘Neither Joe nor I would want to take drugs or treatments to change the fact we have Asperger’s, even if they existed,’ says Sandra. ‘Knowing we have it has made our relationship stronger and we wouldn’t change that.’",

        "document": "An 'aggressive' Oxford University bursar was sacked from a college run by a former BBC boss after a conspiracy to oust her, a tribunal heard today. Jean Wright, 60, claimed she was fired from her role after she pushed for a university archivist colleague to be dismissed over harassment allegations - a move she says turned other staff against her. College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation.' Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is suing St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. Jean Wright, 60, (left) is suing Oxford University's St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. College master Mark Damazer CBE (right) has rubbished her allegations . The home bursar said depression affected her work, but Mr Damazer said the college was not initially aware of her condition and, even if it had been, believed it did everything it could to help her. St Peter's College's alumni includes actor Hugh Dancy, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and former FA executive David Davies. Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010. Early in his time there, Mrs Wright - an employee for 17 years - told Mr Damazer she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about volunteer archivist Geoffrey Fouquet. Mr Fouquet had apologised following an investigation but Mrs Wright made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in June 2012 and a new probe was launched. This was dismissed but Mr Damazer decided he wanted to replace Mr Fouquet by Christmas 2012. Mrs Wright appealed the probe's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work. Around the same time there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall, which resulted in his dismissal. This decision was subsequently overturned, after which Mrs Wright met Mr Damazer. Mrs Wright was sacked from St Peter's College (pictured) after 12 gross misconduct allegations were made . 'She asked me if she might still be able to sack Roger because he was \"no good\" and he should have done more about his dyslexia,' Mr Damazer told the employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire. In early 2013, upset employees began to make complaints about Mrs Wright, including that she was 'being very difficult and making their lives at work constantly unpleasant', Mr Damazer said. 'The nature of the complaints against the claimant were similar in that staff advised that she had been aggressive, hostile, threatening and abusive,' the former BBC controller said. Following an investigation, 12 gross misconduct allegations were made and Mrs Wright was sacked as a result in mid-2013. Mr Damazer said: 'I know that the claimant has suggested that the disciplinary process was somehow orchestrated by various people within the college as a result of her complaints about Mr Fouquet. I am not aware of any such connection. 'The claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself. These allegations are untrue and without foundation. 'The college has sought at all times to deal with the claimant's behaviour and the complaints about her in a fair and appropriate way but could not simply ignore so many staff in distress, some of whom wished to leave their long-standing posts because of her aggression, threats and hostile approach. Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, (pictured outside the tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire) claims she was sacked after she pushed for a fellow colleague to be dismissed over allegations of harassment . 'While I was not directly involved in the decision making process I believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates. 'The college stands by its decisions in relation to the claimant and notes that in the claimant's absence, the college staff are much happier.' Mr Damazer added that he was not aware Mrs Wright had been suffering from a condition which made her disabled under the Equality Act 2010. She had 20 days off in October 2012 and had 12 counselling sessions before being signed off with depression in December 2012 and work-related stress in January 2013. 'The college was not aware of the claimant's disability at the relevant time,' Mr Damazer said. 'Having now had sight of the medical reports, it is difficult to see what else could have been done to accommodate the claimant.' Mrs Wright's role included managing finances and budgets, overseeing accommodation needs for more than 200 students, cleaning rooms and managing events. 'The fact that she was able to undertake these complex duties practically is not indicative of the disability she describes,' he added. The college head added that he knew Mrs Wright made negative comments about his appointment, claiming he was not concerned with staff welfare - something he said was untrue. He said: 'I have always sought to be both equitable in tone and keen to stress the importance of fairness to all.' Mr Damazer said he organised a Christmas party at his home but said Mrs Wright was not keen on the idea. 'A party was arranged and was a success although the claimant did not attend this function, subsequent Christmas staff parties or the annual summer parties that my wife and I introduced,' he said. Mr Damazer and Mrs Wright are due to give further evidence to the hearing tomorrow. The case continues.",

        "document": "By . Jenny Hope And Matthew Mckew . Women carrying devastating inherited conditions yesterday backed the Government’s approval of DNA treatment to create babies with three genetic parents – a technique that could let them have healthy children. Ministers say they will publish draft regulations for Britain to become the first country legalising the controversial IVF procedure, although it will be up to MPs to vote them in. The move has sparked an ethical debate, with desperate women who could benefit calling for an urgent change in the law. Sharon's son Edward Bernardi died last week at the age of 21, after battling the rare hereditary condition Leigh's Disease since the age of four (pictured aged one with his mother) However, some groups fear the technology could lead to designer babies. But Sharon Bernardi, who has lost seven children, said: ‘We are not changing the colour of eyes and we are not choosing to have boys and girls, we just want a baby to be healthy and survive, that’s all.’ Rachel Kean, who risks giving any future children Melas disease, which affects the brain, nervous system and muscles, said: ‘To have the option of knowing that your child could live a life free of these devastating diseases and live without this cruel life is something incredible.’ The technique involves replacing defective DNA in the mother’s egg with material from a donor egg. The resulting healthy child would therefore have genetic material from three parents – two mothers and a father. For the first time the so-called ‘germ line’ of inherited DNA from the mother would be altered which, critics say, would mark a turning point in the ethics of reproductive technology. Sharon (pictured with son Edward) has lost seven children and believes that the procedure would help babies survive . Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Government’s chief medical officer, said the ban on tinkering with the fundamental DNA that determines an person’s make-up, such as facial features and eye colour, will not change. But taking a snippet of DNA during the proposed process was more like replacing a defective ‘battery pack’ in human cells, she said. Rachel Kean said that the option to know your children could survive would be priceless . It would affect a tiny amount of DNA in mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy – which is only passed down by the mother. Mothers with certain defective DNA can pass on mitochondrial diseases. If MPs approve the regulations, the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015. It is expected that up to ten healthy babies with three parents each could be born every year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and dying young. Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said: ‘The Academy is delighted that the Department of Health is taking steps to ensure techniques which could reduce the number of children born with rare mitochondrial diseases can move closer to being used in the clinic.’ Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said: ‘Mitochondrial diseases are some of the most debilitating inherited conditions, for which there are few therapies and no cures. ‘Acknowledging the need for treatments to be proven safe and effective and for the public to feel comfortable with the implications is important, but that caution must not prevent us taking bold steps in the adoption of such potentially life-saving advances.’ But Helen Watt, of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford, said the procedure would deliberately create an embryo for ‘spare parts’, adding: ‘Parenthood is about unconditional welcome of children, not manufacture and control. Couples who do not want to take the risk of passing on mitochondrial disease might want to consider ethical alternatives like adoption.’ Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said: ‘It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of a biased and inadequate consultation.’ The experience of losing seven children left Sharon Bernardi devastated. Six died within four days of being born after suffering from diseases caused by defects in her mitochondrial DNA. Mrs Bernardi, 46, from Sunderland, and her husband Neil believe the new preventative technology is ‘the best way forward’. She believes it ‘would have made a huge difference’ to her life and helped with her desperate hope for a healthy child. She said: ‘It’s quite hard to keep going and trying, but I had to.’ When her son Edward survived his first week, she dared to hope things would be better. But at four and half he was diagnosed with Leigh’s disease, a result of mutations within mitochondrial DNA that affect the brain and nervous system. Edward confounded doctors’ predictions that he would live only a few months and reached his 21st birthday before dying. Mrs Bernardi said: ‘Edward was my life. You live with that pain every day.’ For Rachel Kean, the risk of passing on defective DNA and the possibility of having severely disabled children is a real fear. Miss Kean, 24, is having tests to see if she has Melas disease, caused defective mitochondrial DNA. Her mother is a carrier and it led to the death of her maternal aunt. Miss Kean, from London, said: ‘This is not about eugenics. We are talking about preventing life-threatening diseases.’",

        "document": "By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Mental health disorders such as depression and work-related stress are now the leading cause of long-term sickness absence in working-age Australians. The absences, many of them permanent, are costing the economy more than $12 billion a year in lost productivity and disability benefits and the risks are just as inherent in teachers and lawyers as they are in front-line emergency service workers. But one Australian group aligned with mental health advocacy is helping treat the 1.4 million Australians coping with the disorder - by introducing new workplace programs to combat increased stress levels. Sam Harvey is helping workplaces better cope with the stigma associated with mental health . A team of researchers from the Black Dog Institute and UNSW are helping people deal with work-related . Workplace Mental Health Researcher Sam Harvey from the Black Dog Institute is teaming up with employers to manage staff stress levels. Firefighters are on the front-line coping with trauma . He, along with a team of researchers from the university of NSW, have identified a number of interventions that are effective in reducing significant mental illness for working-age Australians. 'Consider workplace health promotion strategies that include both physical activity incentives and mental health awareness and education,' he said. He said people in occupations with regular exposure to traumatic events, such the police, paramedics, fire fighters, military personnel, medical staff and journalists have historically been associated with post traumatic stress. His team is helping reduce this - by way of  therapy and relaxation training at the place where people spend 'one-half of their waking lives' - at work. Along with in-house workplace counselling and the provision of formal return to work programs for people recovering from mental illness, he said the programs are showing to have an effect in reducing depression. Mr Harvey said employers often do not know how to cope with the issue of mental health in the workplace. 'It is easy for employers to recognise a physical illness, for instance someone who has hurt there leg,' he said. 'They get a get well card and an office on the ground floor.' 'But for someone coming back from depression they (employers and colleagues) don't how to speak to them.' Other experiences such as marital distress, financial strain or dependent children can exacerbate work stress and result in strain, illness and sickness absence. In addition, other issues such as substance misuse, poor diet and limited exercise may be directly or indirectly related to either the organisation culture or personal choices. Write caption here . The Black Dog Institute is a world leader in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. Emergency Service personnel area the highest risk of suffering mental health issues . But despite how bad the workplace might be, Mr Harvey said the impact of unemployment on mental health is much worse. During the Global Financial Crisis, Dr Harvey said the rate of suicide in America and Europe was inflated quite dramatically as a result of job losses and financial insecurity. Some 5000 additional suicides were committed by people across America and Europe in 2008 - the year the GFC hit. In Australia, the problem was less severe. In Australia issues such as 'downsizing corporations,' highlighted most recently by the closure of Holden's Australian arm, are adding to mental health stress on working-aged Australians. In the northern suburbs of Adelaide, at the company's Elizabeth plant, the rate of youth unemployment is already at 44 per cent and the city as a whole experienced 209 deaths by suicide in 2011 - the ABS reported. He said the risk of suicide is greater if people have been dismissed from their job - without finding another in a 12 month period. 'Involuntary job loss also increases the risk of suicide and attempted suicide,' he said. Adding that while front-line emergency service workers such as doctors and nurses are among the biggest risk groups, those employed in other 'highly demanding jobs' where there is a mismatch between effort and reward are also not immune. 'This is highly prevalent in teachers and lawyers and elements of the public sector.'",

        "document": "(CNN)  -- Inside a freezer in a research laboratory at the University of Washington are blood and blood plasma samples from 92 people who suffer from mysterious illnesses, including tremors, memory loss and severe migraine headaches. Terry Williams hugs her two boys -- Jake, left, and Zack -- in 2006, before she says toxic cabin air made her sick. They are mostly pilots and flight attendants who suspect they've been poisoned in their workplace -- on board the aircraft they fly. Clement Furlong, University of Washington professor of medicine and genome sciences, leads a team of scientists who have been collecting the samples for 2 ½ years. Furlong said his team is a few months away from finalizing a blood analysis test that will be able to definitely confirm whether the study participants were indeed poisoned by toxic fumes. Results of Furlong's research could expand recognition of what a select group of researchers believes is a largely unrecognized risk of flying: the chance that poisonous fumes enter the cabin. \"There's a danger of inhaling compounds that are coming out of the engine,\" said Furlong in his laboratory.  See a diagram of how the air is circulated » . The air we breathe on board a plane is a 50-50 mix of filtered, recirculated air and so-called \"bleed air\" -- which bleeds off the engines, and then is pressurized and cooled before being sent into the cabin through vents. If an engine oil seal leaks, aviation engineers and scientists say, the bleed air can become contaminated with toxins. In 2002 the National Academies of Sciences' National Research Council reported \"contaminant exposures result from the intake of chemical contaminants (e.g., engine lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, deicing fluids and their degradation products) into the Environmental Control System and then into the cabin.\" Of particular concern are toxic anti-wear agents in the oil, designed to prolong an engine's life, called tricresyl phosphates. \"The engine seals fail and there's very potent toxins that can come on board,\" said Furlong. Neuropsychologist Sarah Mackenzie Ross of University College London studied 27 British pilots who claimed they had inhaled contaminated air and subsequently had difficulty processing information and slowed reaction times. Her testing confirmed their symptoms. \"They did appear to underperform on tasks that required attention, processing speed, reaction time, and what we call executive functioning, which is high-level decision making,\" said Ross. Former flight attendant Terry Williams believes she is a victim of such a \"fume event.\" She complains of debilitating migraine headaches, tremors, and blind spots in her field of vision. \"It's been so constant and just continues to worsen so it's extremely frustrating,\" said Williams, who is suing Boeing, the owner of McDonnell Douglas, which made the MD-82 aircraft on which she worked. \"I'm frustrated that I don't feel any better and it's over two years after the exposure.\" Boeing told CNN, \"It is our belief that air quality on airplanes is healthy and safe.\" In its response to Williams' suit, the company said: \"The potential for bleed air contamination has been known through the aviation industry for many years.\" But Boeing denies any responsibility for Terry Williams' illness. While Williams' symptoms appear to be quite rare, it appears that fume events occur with regularity. A British study for the House of Lords found fume events in 1 of every 2,000 flights. In the U.S., airlines are required to report \"fume events\" to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were 108 such reports last year. So why wouldn't more flight attendants, pilots and passengers suffer symptoms? Furlong said a small percentage of people (how small is not known) appear to be highly sensitive to the most toxic chemicals. They may be genetically disposed to a strong reaction, possessing multiple genes of metabolizing proteins in their livers, or temporarily have high enzyme levels (which can be triggered by prescription drugs) that will act on the inhaled chemicals to magnify their toxicity. \"If you happen to be taking a medication that turns on the protein that converts pre-toxin to very potent toxin, you've got an issue,\" said Furlong. As a result, someone sitting next to a victim may have inhaled the same contaminated fumes, but not suffer the same reaction. How might you know that you may have been exposed to a \"fume event\" while flying? Experts say the telltale sign is a \"dirty sock\" smell. That's butyric acid from engine oil, which itself is not highly toxic. But along with it comes the deadly nonodorous compounds tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate and mono-ortho-cresyl phosphate. Boeing's new plane, the 787 Dreamliner, has been designed so that air entering the cabin from outside will not \"bleed\" off the engines. The company says that's only for fuel efficiency purposes, not because of any concern about the quality of bleed air in its current fleet of aircraft. Indeed, Boeing and the FAA say the air quality on airplanes is as good or better than that of the average office building or home. CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.",

        "document": "His actions have touched many across the world and revitalised the Catholic church . But for Pope Francis, comforting this stricken man after today's weekly audience in St Peter's Square was another simple act of compassion. In scenes strikingly similar to his encounter with the disfigured Vinicio Riva two weeks before, the pontiff first spoke with the worshipper and then put his arms around him, blessing him. The man's identity is not known, nor are the details of what caused such terrible damage to his face. Pope Francis may have been sneaking out of the Vatican at night to give money to the poor on the streets of Rome. Here he is pictured after his weekly Papal audience in St. Peter's Square blessing a severely disfigured man . Together in prayer: The Pope and the disabled man shared a private moment where Francis I gestured up to the sky . Personal connection: Pope Francis  leant in to hug and kiss the man and give him his blessing at the end of his audience in the Vatican today . However, his delight at spending a few moments in the presence of the leader of the Catholic church can be imagined. Francis, formerly Jorge Bergoglio, only took office eight months ago but his his iconoclastic style has already had a huge impact on the faithful. He has made personal calls to distraught worshippers, invited the homeless to dine at St Peter's Square and washed the feet of young offenders. However, it was a meeting with Mr Riva, who is covered in growths caused by the incurable condition neorofibromatosis, which moved many to tears. Bringer of joy: Pope Francis has made a habit of dedicating time to greet and bless sick or disabled people at the end of the general audience . The Pope, once again in St Peter's . Square for his general audience, put his hands on the 53-year-old . Italian man, kissed, hugged and prayed with him. Speaking earlier this week, Mr Riva said the pontiff's hug was 'like paradise', adding: 'He didn't even think about whether or not to hug me. 'I'm . not contagious, but he didn't know that. But he just did it: he . caressed me all over my face, and as he did I felt only love.' Mr Riva . recollected: 'He came down from the altar to see the sick people. He . embraced me without saying a word. I felt as though my heart was leaving . my body. 'He was completely silent but sometimes you can say more when you say nothing.' 'First, . I kissed his hand while with the other hand he caressed my head and . wounds. Then he drew me to him in a strong embrace, kissing my face. Act of kindness: Pope Francis (left) comforted Vinicio Riva, a 52-year-old Italian who had travelled to Rome for a audience in Saint Peter's Square in November . Painful: Vinicio Riva with a picture of his late mother Rosaria, who suffered from the same condition he does . This weekend the Pope offered 'boxes of mercy' to pilgrims in St Peter's square. Some 20,000 boxes, designed to look like a packet of painkillers, were illustrated with a human heart and contained a rosary. Addressing the crowd in ST Peter's Square the Pontiff said: 'I now want to suggest a medicine. \"What\" you ask, \"the pope is now a pharmacist?\"' The instruction leaflet, available in several languages read: 'Can be used once a day, but in case of emergency can be taken as much as the soul needs. 'My . head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me. It lasted . just over a minute, but to me it seemed like an eternity.' Earlier this year, Francis tweeted . to his 3.2million followers: ’The Pope must serve all people, especially . the poor, the weak, the vulnerable.’ The so-called 'Pope Francis Effect' has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in Catholic congregations in Britain, and similar boosts around the world. New . and lapsed Catholics are surging back to the confession box 'by the . hundreds or thousands', according to the Italian Centre for Studies of . New Religions. In Italy half of priests have noted a marked rise in support for the church. The .

Last month, a study published in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that men value women’s looks over other traits. Women on the other hand, were more concerned about a man’s social status. The study found that after chatting with the opposite-sex with both low and moderate levels of these traits, men, more than women, rejected and reported less attraction toward potential mates with low physical attractiveness. Women, however, indicated similar aversion toward those with low social status. According the study, men and women differ mostly on the low-end qualities that they want to avoid, not the high-end traits that they ideally desire.",

Victim: The headless body of Judith Nibbs was today discovered at her home near Old Street, in Shoreditch, London . They found the 60-year-old victim had been decapitated, while her estranged husband Dempsey Nibbs, 67, had apparently turned the knife on himself causing serious injuries. He is in a critical condition after being taken to hospital at 5am. Police are waiting to quiz him over the death. Mrs Nibbs, who lived on the Charles Square Estate in Shoreditch, had worked for Hackney Borough Council for six years providing meals on wheels for the elderly, in addition to caring for her disabled daughter. Neighbours today paid tribute to the devoted carer. Dean Cummings, 28, who has lived on the estate since he was born, said: ‘I’ve known her all my life. She was a nice lady and didn’t have a bad word to say about anybody. ‘She was always happy with a smile on her face. She had a disabled daughter and an older son who’s about 25. ‘She worked for her kids. The daughter’s in a home. Who’s going to bankroll that now? It’s just so sad.

Neola Robinson, from Texas, was arrested on Saturday for the murder of her husband Pleasant Ervin 'Shorty' Robinson, 52, who went missing in June 2010. The month before, Robinson angrily said to a friend while they were drinking at a bar that she didn't want her husband of three years to come home 'because if he does he’s going to be missing some body parts, or I’m going to kill him. I don't care if I go to prison.' The 62-year-old has been charged with murder. She is on suicide watch in prison where she is being held on $150,000 bail. Charged: Neola Robinson, 62, is charged in connection with the murder of her husband, Ervin Robinson . Buried: The body of Neola Robinson's husband, Ervin, was found in the front yard of the home where they used to live . Shorty's daughter Crystal Robinson . told the Star Telegram her father had been married eight times before . and she thought he had finally met someone who made her happy. Their problems started when she was . injured in a car wreck in October 2009. She had to stop working and grew . jealous about her husband's female friends. Crystal said by May the following . year her dad planned on leaving his wife and removed all the funds from . their joint checking account and opened a separate one. Soon after, Robinson became . upset with her husband when he went to a friend’s funeral against her . wishes. According to the search warrant affidavit, hours after the funeral, Neola Robinson found her husband at Lynn’s . Saloon in Azle with one of his female friends. That’s when she said her husband had better not come home or . she would dismember or kill him, according to the affidavit. Four days later, police responded to a . domestic dispute at the house where Neola Robinson had locked her . husband outside because he refused to give her money, the document said. Michael Wright, co-owner of TJ . Machine & Tool in Azle, where Shorty Robinson had worked, filed the . missing-person report on June 16, 2010, after Robinson didn’t show up . for two weeks. Hidden in plain sight: Ervin had gone missing in May 2010 yet his wife simply told people that he had left her for another woman . Marital troubles: The couple were often heard arguing and had violent episodes but it has still come as shock to many in the community . He said he was not surprised by the recent discovery. 'I had always suspected that something bad had happened to him,' Wright said on Wednesday. Pleasant Ervin Robinson was last seen . on May 29, 2010, on a store security video in the Fort Worth suburb of . Lake Worth buying food and mattresses. The warrant was to search the house for blood evidence, financial documents and DNA. His wife went to the machine shop . where he worked in early June and was shaking as she said: 'He's gone. He's gone,' saying that he packed up some belongings and left on May 31, . 2010, the document said. Officers searching the home in June 2010 found what appeared to be a large blood stain in the bathroom. The officer said the home was clean . and the kitchen floor appeared to have been recently scrubbed, although . the home was cluttered and dirty when he responded to the domestic . dispute the previous month, according to the document. Bank records show that activity . continued on his personal bank account after he was reported missing, . and Neola Robinson can be seen in a bank's ATM video and a store's . security video using a debit card from his bank account, according to . the 2010 affidavit. Disbelief: Neighbours cannot believe how a woman who is on disability benefits was able to bury her husbands body in their front yard . Good inentions: Although Ervin Robinson had a lengthy criminal history including robbery and DWI, his friends say he was turning things around. His wife remains in Tarrant County Jail on $150,000 bail .",

        "document": "How safe is our tap water? It has long been a source of national pride that we can drink straight from our taps without trepidation. But mounting scientific evidence shows that well-intentioned efforts to make our water healthier - by adding fluoride to prevent tooth decay - may actually be having serious long-term effects on our health. Scientists warn that the risks of this controversial public health policy include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth. Investigators also argue that fluoridation does not bring significant benefits over other health initiatives, such as encouraging children and adults to brush their teeth properly. Scientists warn that the risks of 'water fluoridation' include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth . Yesterday, a new danger was added to the risk list when researchers at the University of Kent warned that the mineral may be responsible for causing depression, weight gain and tiredness. They argue that these debilitating symptoms are the result of hypothyroidism — the failure of the thyroid gland to produce hormones that regulate the metabolism. Their study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, says that areas of England with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected. The watchdog Public Health England moved to assure people that 'the totality of evidence, accumulated over decades of research, tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure, and shows no association with reduced thyroid function'. But Professor Stephen Peckham, who led the new study, said that instead of putting more fluoride in our water, the policy should be reversed: 'Consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure,' he said. New research found areas of England with water fluoridation are linked to rates of hypothyroidism 30 per cent higher than expected. Hypothyroidism causes depression, weight gain and tiredness (file photo) That may not be so easily done. More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). Areas of the country with fluoridation schemes include Cumbria, Cheshire, Tyneside, Northumbria, Durham, Humberside, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, the West Midlands and Bedfordshire. A further 330,000 people drink supplies that are naturally fluoridated by rocks in the ground to the level of 1ppm — including residents of Hartlepool and Easington in the North East of England, Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and parts of North Hampshire and South Berkshire. (Other parts of Britain, which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks, see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water.) Greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay, doctors have warned . That's about one in ten of the population exposed to the 1ppm fluoride level, says the BFS, which promotes the treatment of UK water. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental decay began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, America, were fluoridated to 1ppm. But health concerns have meant that in recent years that level has been reduced in the U.S. to 0.7ppm. Nonetheless, politicians and dentists here are pushing for more of us to have our water supplemented to that 1ppm level. More than five-and-a-half million of us already have tap water artificially fluoridated to the 'optimum' level of one part per million parts of water (1ppm), according to the British Fluoridation Society (BFS). Areas of the country with fluoridation schemes include Cumbria, Cheshire, Tyneside, Northumbria, Durham, Humberside, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, the West Midlands and Bedfordshire. A further 330,000 people drink supplies that are naturally fluoridated by rocks in the ground to the level of 1ppm — including residents of Hartlepool and Easington in the North East of England, Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and parts of North Hampshire and South Berkshire. (Other parts of Britain, which are not artificially fluoridated and have low natural levels of fluoride in local rocks, see concentrations of 0.1ppm or even lower in their drinking water.) Only last month, leaders at the Royal College of Surgeons' faculty of dental surgery published a report saying greater fluoridation would cut the admission to hospital annually of some 26,000 children aged between five and nine for tooth decay. 'Water fluoridation is one way of overcoming that,' said the faculty's dean, professor Nigel Hunt. In December, Labour shadow health secretary Andy Burnham pledged to make a priority of adding fluoride to water if his party wins the Election. 'It's a simple way to improve the health of children. There is no evidence it damages health,' he argued. Certainly, it's recognised by the NHS that fluoride disrupts the process of decay by making enamel more resistant to acid attack — which is the cause of rotting teeth — and reducing plaque bacteria's ability to produce acid. The mineral also strengthens enamel in children's growing teeth. However, if a chemical affects the human body in one way, it is almost certainly bound to change other things. And it is these side-effects that particularly alarm some scientists. It is also worth noting that the mineral which occurs naturally in water is calcium fluoride, while the chemical used to supplement levels of water is sodium fluoride — which critics say can be more dangerous to health. As well as specifically physical side-effects related to fluoridation, there are also concerns over its effect on our brains. A 2012 analysis of previous studies found strong indications that fluoride supplementation may hinder children's intellectual development, causing on average a drop of seven IQ points. Fluoride in water may also harm internal organs. A Polish laboratory study found evidence of liver damage that seems to have been caused by the fluoride interfering with the way our bodies use antioxidants to defend against tissues breaking down. There are also suspected links with kidney disease. One study has found an association between high levels of fluoride in the water and painful kidney stones, which were four times more common than in a similar area without high fluoride, researchers found. Scientists warn that the risks of adding fluoride to water include brain impairment in children, liver and kidney disease, crippling bone disorders and, ironically, disfigured teeth (file picture) The most obvious evidence of harm from fluoride supplementation is dental fluorosis, where teeth become mottled and discoloured by over-exposure. It is also possible that chronic bone disease skeletal fluorosis can be caused by ingesting large amounts of fluoride, which can lead to crippling arthritis, bone fractures and muscle weakness. In response to the established risks, it is recommended by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency that an adult does not consume more than 3-4mg of fluoride per day — the equivalent of drinking three to four litres of water with 1ppm fluoride (the UK has established no maximum RDA of fluoride). But it is more complicated than that. The dangers from exposure to fluoride have been increased over the past few years as the mineral has increasingly been added to commercial products — not only toothpaste but others such as baby milk formula. Even tea can push you over the limit, especially in areas with fluoridated water. A study by Derby University found cheap supermarket tea is particularly high in the mineral, which occurs in it naturally. Four mugs of tea can contain as much as 6mg. Nevertheless, local authorities are currently pushing, with the encouragement of Public Health England, to fluoridate more people's water. But the backlash has begun. Earlier this month, protesters in Hull launched a campaign to halt the city council's plans to add fluoride to their water. Figures show 43 per cent of children in Hull are suffering tooth decay, one of the worst rates in the country. However, local protesters, such as Paddy Holdsworth, of East Yorkshire Against Fluoride, fear the dangers of unwanted side-effects. 'This is compulsory medication,' he says. 'It is just crazy.' Another obstacle lies in the path of the pro-fluoridation camp — a significant hole in their argument that mineral supplementation is the best way to improve mass dental health . About ten years ago, a review of previous evidence by York University researchers found that tooth decay in children across Europe had fallen, irrespective of fluoride in the water. Indeed, the countries showing the biggest decrease — Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark — do not fluoridate their supplies. 'This probably reflects use of fluoridated toothpastes and other factors, including perhaps nutrition,' said the investigators in the British Medical Journal, who concluded that the evidence 'on the potential benefits and harms of adding fluoride to water is relatively poor'. This argument was perhaps unwittingly reinforced last year by national survey evidence from Public Health England itself. The authority warned that drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay, and called for under-threes to have milk and water. And surely it is just such mass education — not mass medication — that in the long term will improve dental health. Our health chiefs should treat us as adults. Rather than slipping something into our water, isn't it high time these authorities introduced sanctions against parents who fecklessly allow their children's teeth to rot? Drinking fruit juice and squash from bottles and feeding cups was responsible for significant amounts of tooth decay, and called for under-threes to have milk and water instead .",

        "document": "Created: . 06:45 EST, 6 May 2014 . A Harley Street nutritionist has been fined after claiming his fitness regime could combat cancer. Former bodybuilder Dr Stephen Ferguson, 45, provided a range of protein shakes and multivitamin drinks, which had 'cured' two of his clients. The health food range could also heal epilepsy, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis, according to his website. With 300 video testimonials from satisfied clients on the website, The Natural Health Clinic enjoyed a turnover of £70,000 in its first year of business. The Harley Street nutritionist told the court he did not know how the word 'cured' came to appear on his website . But today, Dr Ferguson was fined £1,750 for violating the Cancer Act. The act was designed to protect vulnerable people from unprofessional advice. Sentencing, District Judge Adrian Turner told . Hammersmith Magistrate's Court: 'The written material refers to cancer, . with a link to the clinic. 'It is plainly implied this is someone who . treats cancer. 'Any member of the public would believe this is someone who has treated and in two cases cured cancer. 'I’m . satisfied Dr Ferguson was fully involved with everything that’s on his . site and anyone reading this would have no doubt this was an offer of . services for those seeking treatment for cancer. 'I’m . in no doubt those YouTube testimonials are a major part of the . company’s business in treating cancer and Dr Ferguson’s approach to the . Cancer Act has been a head in the sand one.' District Judge Adrian Turner at Hammersmith Magistrate's Court ruled that Dr Ferguson was 'fully involved' Vitamin C capsules sold on Dr . Ferguson's website were captioned with the testimonial: 'Many have said . it helps them get rid of cancer.' Other . products included Multivitamin PH Balancer, Blood Cleanser & Energy . Booster and a Tropical Fruit Whey Protein Powder, which were advertised . as cures for the life-threatening disease, as well as for asthma, . arthritis, and diabetes. It was also implied the clinic was involved in the successful treatment of a patient with prostate cancer. The business flourished between June 17 and October 2 last year, until the council received a complaint. In . a bid to distance himself from the website's content, and video adverts . uploaded to YouTube, Dr Ferguson told the court a female employee was . responsible. 'She was meant to stick to specific guidelines and not put on anything about treating cancer or anything like that,' he said. 'She was asked not to include her own personal views on there. 'I . know it should not say anything that says we are treating cancer. It’s . purely for diet and fitness and exercise and nothing else.' Acknowledging a video strap line that included the word 'cured' for a Merkel cell tumour treatment, Dr Ferguson told the court: 'I don’t know how it got there.' He denied uploading the YouTube content to a page owned by username ‘SFSTEVE100’, and claimed not to know who did. 'I don’t write on my website, I have other people update it for me. I was checking the website, but obviously not everything that went on there, there’s three thousand pages,' he added. The judge also ordered Dr Ferguson to pay £2,500 costs and a £120 victim surcharge, telling him: 'You are not accused of quackery, no one is saying you are not a qualified nutritionist. 'These are reckless offences, not a deliberate attempt by you to exploit the vulnerable.'",

        "document": "By . Associated Press . Guilty: Stephanie Greene, 39, has been  sentenced to 20 years in prison for killing her six-week-old daughter morphine in breast milk . A South Carolina mother has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for killing her six-week-old daughter with an overdose of morphine delivered through her breast milk. Prosecutors said Stephanie Greene, 39, was a nurse and knew the dangers of taking painkillers while pregnant and breast feeding, but chose to conceal her pregnancy from doctors to keep getting her prescriptions. She lost her nursing license in 2004 for trying to get drugs illegally. However Greene's lawyer said she was only trying to stop debilitating pain from a car crash more than a decade before and relied on her own judgment and medical research on the Internet instead of the advice of doctors. The lawyer said Greene is still overwhelmed with grief from the loss of her child, Alexis Catherine Greene, in 2010. The 20-year sentence was the minimum after a Spartanburg County jury found Greene guilty of homicide by child abuse. She could have faced up to life behind bars. Greene will have to serve 16 years before she is eligible for parole. She said nothing in court today and quietly shuffled out of the courtroom, her hands and feet shackled, after she was sentenced. Her lawyer said she will appeal and it's likely the case will be tied up for years to come. It is the first time in the United States that a woman has been prosecuted for killing her child through a substance transmitted in breast milk. Scroll down for video . Adorable: Alexis Catherine Greene (pictured left and right) was born September 28, 2010,  at Mary Black Memorial Hospital . Tragic: Alexis Catherine Greene was just six-weeks-old when she was found dead in her parents' bed in their Campobello home on November 13, 2010 . Greene's lawyer Rauch Wise said prosecutors didn't prove how the baby got the morphine and there is little scientific evidence that enough morphine can gather in breast milk to kill an infant. 'The court can't punish her any more than she already has been by losing a child,' Wise said. Greene's husband Randall Greene did not talk to reporters. Wise said Randy supported his wife and was devastated as he prepared to raise their seven-year-old son alone. Greene's fourth pregnancy in 2010 was unplanned, but she and her husband of 10 years joyously accepted the surprise, Wise said. She has two children from a previous marriage. Alexis was born healthy, and her mother chose to breast feed. Forty-six days later, on November 13, 2010, Greene called 911 to report her baby was unconscious in her bed. On a recording of the call, she sounds groggy and unfocused. The former nurse first tries to do CPR compressions on the baby's back and has trouble counting to keep pace. Investigators at the scene found dozens of pill bottles and painkiller patches on her nightstand where the couple's then four-year-old son could get to them. A toxicology report from the baby's autopsy found a level of morphine in the child's body that a pathologist testified could have been lethal for an adult, prosecutor Barry Barnette said. Sad: Stephanie Greene's (pictured during a court appearance, date unknown) lawyers say she is still grieving the loss of little Alexis four years since her death . Representation: Stephanie Greene's (right) lawyer Rauch Wise (left) said his client would appeal the 20 year sentence because prosecutors didn't prove how the morphine got into baby Alexis's system . A review of her medical records showed Greene carefully hid her pregnancy from her primary doctor. After a home pregnancy test showed she was pregnant, she told her doctor she needed to go to a gynecologist for a birth control. She then got prenatal care from that doctor while not telling her all the painkillers she was taking, Barnette said. 'She was a nurse. She knew how to work the system,' Barnette said. 'She caused the loss of that child.' But that is an unfair characterization of a woman who remains racked with chronic pain from a 1998 wreck where she fractured her skull and pelvis, Wise said. 'She needed those meds to get up in the morning and function,' Wise said. 'She was on total disability because of her pain, her fibromyalgia and all the other things wrong with her.' Scene: Little Alexis was found dead inside her parents' home at 180 Kimbrell Loop in Campobello, South Carolina (pictured) Greene still faces 38 counts of obtaining prescription drugs through fraud, and Barnette said he is still deciding whether to take those cases to court . Greene had her nursing license suspended in South Carolina in 2004 because she was irrational at work, tried to call in a prescription illegally and refused a drug test, according to an order from the state's Nursing Board. Barnette doesn't want his prosecution to stop women from breastfeeding. He took this case personally because his wife had a miscarriage in 1989. She is a nurse and personally reviewed the case. 'We make sacrifices every day for our children,' Barnette said. 'She decided she was going to have her drugs and sacrifice the health, and ultimately the life, of her child.' Scene: The jury at Spartanburg County court (pictured) found Greene guilty of homicide by child abuse .",

        "document": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Music producer Phil Spector was sentenced Friday to the maximum sentence of 19 years to life for the murder six years ago of actress Lana Clarkson. Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict. That means Spector, 69, would be 88 before he would be eligible for parole. Slumped, stone-faced and wearing a dark suit and bright red tie, he sat silently throughout his sentencing by Judge Larry Paul Fidler. Spector's lawyer gave a $17,000 check to Donna Clarkson, the victim's mother, to pay for her funeral expenses -- part of the court-ordered sentence. \"All of our plans together are destroyed,\" the mother said, reading a statement on behalf of her family. \"Now, I can only visit her at the cemetery.\" Fidler denied a motion for a new trial by defense attorney Doron Weinberg, who said he would file an appeal. \"The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson,\" Weinberg said.  Watch Spector receive his sentence » . \"Obviously, he's not very happy,\" Spector's wife, Rachelle, told reporters about her husband. \"I'm going to stand by him and get him out of that awful place so he can come home where he belongs.\" Clarkson, 40, was found dead -- slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth -- in February 2003.  View a timeline of the case » . Spector's trial, which began in October, ended last month when jurors deliberated for 30 hours and then announced a guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge. Fidler had ruled jurors also could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations. Jurors then were deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long \"pattern of violence\" involving firearms. \"This was not an isolated incident,\" Fidler said, noting Spector's two firearms-related convictions from the 1970s. \"The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that.\" In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector \"a very dangerous man\" who \"has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth.\" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out to jurors, however, that Clarkson had bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something he said a suicidal woman would not have done. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. \"This entire jury took this so seriously,\" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that \"it's tough to be in a jury,\" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie \"Barbarian Queen\" and appeared in many other films, including \"Deathstalker,\" \"Blind Date,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and the spoof \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\" Spector's professional trademark was the \"Wall of Sound,\" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called \"little symphonies for the kids\" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, \"Let It Be,\" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.",

        "document": "By . Andy Tillett In Santa Cruz, California . and Ashley Collman . and Lydia Warren . Google executive Forrest Tim Hayes had extramarital relations with girls besides Alix Tichelman before he died, and the captain of the yacht who discovered his body may have tampered with evidence, police said today. The body of the married father of five was discovered after he had been injected with heroin by call girl Tichelman – who then fled the scene – on November 23, but police say they have evidence he had also been seeing other women. Santa Cruz Deputy Chief of Police Steve Clark exclusively told MailOnline: ‘We’re aware that he had other liaisons.’ 'He was meeting with people. And this wasn’t his first encounter with her.’ Scroll down for video . Heartless: Alix Tichelman, 26, appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face manslaughter and drug charges in relation to the November 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. Prosecutors are accusing Tichelman, a call girl, of leaving Hayes to die of a drug overdose . Online connection: Tichelman (left) allegedly met Hayes (right) on the dating website Seeking Arrangement, which pairs 'sugar babies' with rich, older, men and women . Meanwhile, we can reveal police suspect the captain . who found Hayes’ body tidied up . the boat after he found Hayes’ body. On the night of his death, the . 50ft yacht had not left Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor. ‘The . captain is the one who reported finding his body,' Clark told MailOnline. 'The boat was in . pretty clean condition when we found it and we suspect he may have tried . to clean things up a bit. ‘He . did hinder the investigation initially, and it cost us a little bit of . time. I understand why he did it, he has a professional reputation, he . has high-end, wealthy clients, I’m sure he is paid well and part of that . payment is for his discretion,’ he added. The . captain also told police the main cabin camera, which allegedly showed . Tichelman failing to help Hayes after his overdose, calmly finishing her . glass of wine then collecting her things before leaving the scene, . wasn’t working. ‘The camera that was in the cabin and would show us what had happened - he told us it didn’t work,’ Clark said. Santa . Cruz police later found the video footage had all been stored on a . remote server in a media cloud, and managed to get a court order and . release a copy from the technology company that had set it up. Other flings: Santa Cruz Deputy Chief of Police Steve Clark exclusively told MailOnline that Hayes  'had other liaisons' Tichelman, 26, is accused of heartlessly leaving a client to die from a drug overdose, . wrote about her 'love' of killing sprees in a Facebook post published . just days before her July 4 arrest. She appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face . manslaughter and drug charges in connection to the November 2013 death . of Hayes, 51. Deputy Chief of Police Clark told MailOnline Clark that when she was arrested Tichelman was ‘shocked’ but started to reveal her ‘callous’ side during interview. He . added: ‘It was pretty clear that her self-centered nature came through . in this interview, as it did in her committing the crime as well. ‘She . has had contact with people on the outside who she has been encouraging . to remove her social media information. She’s still trying to cover her . tracks and cover evidence which might implicate her. ‘It’s . shocking from the perspective of how callous and uncaring she was. That . she could be so cold and not even cry out for help or call 911 or try . to revive him in any way, it shows the type of person and how egocentric . she was.’ Surveillance . footage obtained by investigators shows Tichelman injecting Hayes with . heroin, and then casually leaving him to die when he has an adverse . reaction to the drug. And this may not have been Tichelman's first killing, as detectives are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. According to a report by Fox News, Tichelman had phoned up 911 and reported the heroin overdose death of  a man named Dean Riopelle. Police in Milton Georgia are taking another look at the case. In another case, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel, Tichelman may have dated the lead singer of the Atlanta-based group, The Judies, Warren Ullom, who was sent  to prison for manslaughter for a heroin overdose. Stone cold: The high-priced prostitute didn't look worried when she appeared in court on July 9 . No plea yet: Tichelman has not yet entered a plea, and was assigned a public defender in court on Wednesday . Tichelman was apparently fascinated with the topic of serial murders, according to posts she wrote on Facebook just last month. 'Really . nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in . cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post. 'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added. In court on Wednesday, Tichelman did not enter a plea and was assigned a public defender. Tichelman has been held on $1.5million bond since her July 4 arrest, when she met with an undercover cop at a Santa Cruz hotel who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. The high-priced prostitute allegedly met Hayes, the married father of five, on website 'Seeking Arrangement' which pairs 'sugar babies' with rich older men or women. Police say the two met a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Scene: She allegedly took the heroin to his yacht, pictured, and administered the drug but as he lay dying, she stepped over his body to finish a glass of wine before leaving the boat . Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said. Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside. Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. 'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online . 'We know they've had a previous . relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION. 'This was all set up . through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the . aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google . searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of . this.' Fetish fan: Tichelman was arrested on Friday after police posed as a client and met her at a hotel . Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County for the July 4 arrest. When asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported. 'She showed . absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark . said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.' Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. Hayes, . who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to . wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his . obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest . will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than . anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on . his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's . Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before . majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty . school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist . According to Tichelman's Facebook, she went to high school in Atlanta before attending George State University and then beauty school. She listed her occupation as a makeup artist . She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months ago. In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an \"intense child\" and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- For the third time, Mahmoud Al-Qassab lowers the body of one of his children into the ground. He steps back as neighbors and relatives shovel dirt over his teenage daughter's grave. He does not cry or wail. \"I thank God this is my third martyr: Ahmed, Abdullah and now her. I thank God, and I will not say anything against his fate,\" Mahmoud told an activist filming the small funeral. Just a few months ago, 18-year-old Ayat Al-Qassab sang and danced with her mother and aunts as they dressed the bride in her wedding gown. Now, her shattered and bloodied body lies in a grave below the crumbling, bullet-ridden buildings of Homs. Read more about Ayat's wedding . \"She was killed and she took my heart, my soul, my mind and everything with her, but we will not give up. We will not retreat. We must keep moving forward,\" husband-turned-widower Mohammad Jumbaz said quietly. Ayat did not lead battles or chair diplomatic talks. She is just like many other Syrians -- young, hopeful, and now dead. \"There was no daughter like her. She was bright and beautiful and playful. Then the siege happened and with it her destiny,\" Aisha Al-Qassab, Ayat's mother, said as tears streamed down her face. Ayat and Mohammad recently found out they were expecting their first child. The new family was elated, even as UNICEF estimates that 2.5 million people, including many children, are affected by the violence and instability in Syria. \"My love, she was only married a few months, then pregnant and now a martyr,\" Ayat's mother said. A 120 mm rocket fired into the family home struck Ayat in the head, killing her and her unborn child instantly. Ayat's father, who was standing nearby, was hit in the shoulder and wounded. \"The week before she died, a rocket attack injured her hand, and I had this feeling in my heart that it was a sign. It was as if God gave us just one more week to take her in and say goodbye,\" Mohammad said. Young, defiant and in love . Brave and defiant, Ayat hardly spoke of the frivolities of bridal gowns and wedding cake. \"I wore a white dress, but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power,\" Ayat said in an interview shortly after getting married. \"We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government.\" Although Ayat and Mohammad married just a week after meeting, the two were in love, her mother said. \"She was young, and I had not planned on her marrying, but the siege brought her destiny. A young hardworking man liked her and she saw him and he saw her and they fell in love and got married,\" Aisha said, shaking her head as if trying to forget. The newlyweds saw their marriage as a symbol of the resistance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For Mohammad, the part-time rebel fighter, revolution remained his shield, but the young man also believed living and loving was the greatest defiance of all. \"She was wonderful. We were newlyweds and we were happy. Even if she upset me I could not be mad at her. Her gentleness captured my heart and I pray that God opens the gates of heaven for her,\" he said, cracking a tiny smile as he remembered his wife. Guns and battles are far from Mohammad's true passion: baking sweet desserts. The young pastry chef loves making indulgent treats for Homs' fighters, families and children. \"When I give a family sweets, it is as if I am handing them a treasure,\" he said as he laughed loudly for the first time, thankful for the power of a single cookie in a city ravaged by war. Ayat shared Mohammad's delight for delivering glimpses of joy through pastries drizzled with sweet \"ater\" or syrup, even as gas, flour, sugar and milk were in short supply. \"She loved sweets, and more than that, she loved to watch me make them. We had even made date cookies and she died before she could eat them, so we gave them away,\" Mohammad said, still smiling. A childhood cut short . Ayat was born and raised in the Old District of Homs, Syria's third largest city. Her father was a laborer and her mother stayed at home with the kids, instilling in her the value of hard work and family. The third of five children, Ayat's two older brothers spoiled the brown-eyed girl while the two younger siblings depended on her care. \"She loved to study and she would always study. When the siege happened there were no schools left open,\" Ayat's mother said. More than 2,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed in civil war-related violence, and about 600 schools serve as makeshift shelters for internally displaced people, according to the Syrian government. \"She loved to help me with the housework, but I would not let her. I wanted her to study,\" Aisha said. The western city of Homs relies largely on industrial jobs. For Ayat's family, education provided an opportunity for their children to escape manual labor in a country where the average monthly salary is $300. \"She wanted to be an expert in Sharia law -- maybe she could have even got her Ph.D. if she got good grades, but God did not plan this for her,\" Aisha said. War and marriage . The Syrian uprising sparked by revolts across the Middle East forever changed Ayat's country and transformed Homs into a bastion of resistance against al-Assad's government. \"(Ayat) grew up on the love of God and when the demonstrations started she fell in love with the revolution and was very proud of her brothers who fought and died for freedom,\" Mahmoud said. Revolution morphed into a full-scale civil war, consuming every corner of the beautiful country in a bloody and relentless fight for power. Amid a stifling siege on Homs, where the Syrian Army regularly blocked food, medicine and supplies, Mohammad and Ayat got married. \"I am very happy here with my life. Here our life is better than a honeymoon outside our country. We are not like the people who fled. Here we have our pride and we are defending our nation. I would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells than for me to abandon my nation,\" Ayat told CNN earlier this year. But as the bitter winter cold and intensifying government shelling added another dimension to the struggle for survival, Ayat began fearing for her life and the life of her unborn child. \"She began to get very scared, and every time she would hear a plane fly overhead she would become afraid,\" Mohammad recalled, \"but she never asked to leave Homs. The opposite -- she was proud to stay, and I thank God for her martyrdom.\" In Islam, martyrdom is a high honor granted by God to those who die fighting for their religion, country or rights of their community. Muslims believe a martyr is destined for heaven, so loved ones must celebrate rather than mourn their death. \"God gave her parents the patience to overcome the death of her brothers, and God gave me the patience to overcome the death of my brother. God willing, he will grant us the patience to overcome Ayat's death, too,\" Mohammad said. After nearly two years of conflict, more than 40,000 people have lost their lives. Syria sees a steady stream of funerals for its so-called martyrs, where shrill cries of joy compete with wails of pain in haunting processions for the dead. As difficult as it seems to rejoice over the death of a loved, the Islamic principle of martyrdom is at its core about blind faith that those who died righteously reside in a better place in the afterlife. It is a conviction the family clings to when nothing else can explain the death of a young, pregnant woman only a few months into her marriage. \"We had prayed that she would live and they would have children,\" Aisha said. \"And that we would become a grandpa and grandma, but God remembered her and he took her,\" her husband interjected. \"I pray that he destines us to martyrdom, too,\" Aisha added. The family's near impenetrable faith prevents them from protesting Ayat's fate, but by accepting her death, the family must survive on memories of her life. \"I will remember everything about her. What more can I say? I will remember everything, everything,\" Mohammad murmured. And with that, the family members bowed their heads and fell silent.",

He was one of the prime-time stars of 80s television with his clean-cut comedy routines and impressions. But Bobby Davro was left appalled rather than entertained when he tuned in to watch fellow comedian Jimmy Carr this week. Within hours he took to Twitter to vent his disgust at the content of Being Funny on Channel 4. Foul mouth: Clean-cut comedian Bobby Davro (right) was left appalled when he tuned in to watch Jimmy Carr (left) this week, taking to Twitter to express his disgust . Davro, 55, who became a star with ITV . shows including Bobby Davro on the Box, claimed that ‘standards have . dropped’ after watching Carr’s performance. ‘I can’t believe the joke he told to finish his show,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry but it’s beyond bad taste. Go and see a good panto with comedians that can make a whole family laugh without resorting to foul language. Innuendo not puerile filth!’ He wasn’t the only one to find Carr’s gags a turn-off. Scores of viewers reached for the off switch mid-way through the show despite it being screened after 10pm on Wednesday. Offensive: Some of Jimmy Carr's 'less crude' jokes . Carr poked fun at the blind, the death of Princess Diana, homosexuals and children, and made a tasteless Holocaust joke. The show was from his performance at a . club in Birmingham and Vivienne Pattison, of pressure group . Mediawatch-UK, said the public reaction highlighted how content for a . comedy gig was not necessarily suitable for TV – even after the . watershed. ‘When you’re in a . club you have to prove that you are 18 or over,’ she said. ‘When it’s . on TV that’s not the case. It’s offered for public presentation and . there is no way of knowing what is going to be included. ‘The fact that people turned off does show this is not what they wanted to see.’ Standards: Davro, 55, who became a star with ITV shows including Bobby Davro on the Box, claimed that 'standards have dropped' after watching Carr¿s performance . Tasteless: Carr poked fun at the blind, the death of Princess Diana, homosexuals and children, and made a tasteless Holocaust joke . Davro fell out of favour as taste in comedy changed – a point he touched upon during his rant at Carr. ‘We all love a good dirty joke but I’m sorry I would never dream of telling ones so offensive as Jimmy’s,’ he said. ‘I can’t believe that TV allows such filthy material. Why is it so popular to use every expletive going? Standards have dropped.’ Davro’s career downturn coincided with a troubled personal life, including a divorce said to have been caused in part by his desire to get back in the big time. It is a position he has never regained, and this year he will be starring in pantomime in Plymouth. Bad taste: Bobby Davro tweeted his disgust at the show . Filth: Davro said comics did not need to resort to foul language . Dropped standards: Davro said he could not believe what was allowed to be shown on television . Davro admitted to a certain envy over Carr’s earnings, but has no wish to follow his path. ‘I wonder if I started to tell jokes like Jimmy Carr that would make me more popular. If I did I think I would be lynched,’ he said. ‘Jimmy Carr is a great comic but I can’t understand how he can tell filthy sexist jokes and be thought of as brilliant.’ Lynched: The comic mused over whether he should tell jokes like Carr . Riches: Davro admitted to a certain envy over Carr's earnings, but has no wish to follow his path . He found support on Twitter, with fellow users describing Carr as ‘insensitive’, ‘offensive’ and ‘so over the line, it’s unreal’. Carr, 41, host of quiz show 8 out of 10 Cats, was criticised by the Prime Minister last year when his use of a controversial Jersey-based tax scheme was revealed. It led to him apologising and withdrawing from the scheme. TV watchdog Ofcom and Channel 4 confirmed they had received a handful of complaints about Being Funny, which had 780,000 viewers. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘This was a repeat of a Jimmy Carr stand-up show, which featured his established brand of humour and was broadcast in a late-night slot. It was preceded by a continuity warning for strong language and adult humour.’",

        "document": "Shahe, Yunnan (CNN) -- \"Stand to attention,\" barked the class monitor as we walked into the classroom at the Shahe Primary School, an hour's drive from the county seat of Tengchong, a remote region in China's Yunnan Province. On cue, the 30 or so second-grade pupils stood up and greeted us with wide grins and smiling eyes. I had joined a group of leading educators and volunteers from the Teach For All global network, which places volunteer teachers in disadvantaged schools in 32 different countries. They had gathered in Tengchong for their annual conference. We took a side trip to observe in one of the elementary schools that served Shahe's 3,800 villagers and sat in on a mathematics class. To kick off the morning session, the female teacher asked volunteers to step forward and pretend to be \"passengers\" in a bus. Several pupils \"boarded\", a few got off, and a few more got on as the class shouted a running count of the \"passengers.\" The teacher spent the rest of the 40-minute class teaching the basics of addition and subtraction, frequently leading the pupils in reciting drills. Through the session, pupils sat still, listened attentively and answered questions often in unison. Initially, I was put off by what seemed like rehearsed recitation and learning by rote. \"Old habits,\" a local teacher said. But later, I understood why. \"It has something to do with collective culture in China,\" said Susan Wang, a graduate of Zhejiang Normal University, who had taught in public schools. \"We ...believe in the importance of reciting repetitively. When a book is read a hundred times, a Chinese idiom goes, its meaning becomes naturally clear. \"That's why from childhood we are taught to recite poetry -- you can at least recite, if not write, poetry. \"For subjects like math, it's helpful because it's about remembering pithy formulas. Teachers even make up doggerels (rhymes) to help memorize them.\" For me, my experience in the Shahe classroom illustrates the pros and cons of China's education system. \"Chinese schools excel in knowledge-based teaching,\" said Junheng Li, author of \"Tiger Woman on Wall Street.\" \"For subjects like math and grammar, this is very important, especially in a child's early years of schooling.\" Li, who attended public schools while growing up in Shanghai, said this intense focus on academics \"cultivates strong discipline, work ethics and stamina.\" The Shahe pupils impressed me and fellow observers as disciplined and well-behaved. When I took out my camera, they gladly posed and flashed V signs. Many gathered around me to look at their digital photos. Their eyes sparkled with curiosity. They exuded pent-up energy and hunger for knowledge. \"Except for the migrants, our kids are not as hungry,\" noted an educator for Teach for Austria. \"Here one billion people are hungry, trying to reach the top.\" But this traditional teaching method has its downside. It emphasizes lectures and learning by rote, instead of more give-and-take in the classroom. As in many Chinese schools, it's mostly about tests and exams. \"Education was a series of hoops to jump through, not a process of self-improvement or self- discovery,\" said Li, the author. The \"gaokao\" system -- the annual nationwide college entrance and virtually the sole determinant whether a student goes to college -- has largely contributed to this blind cut-throat competition that involves students, parents and teachers. \"For years leading up to gaokao, Chinese kids are tested and ranked on a narrow set of subjects, leading to incessant and often bitter competition,\" Li explained. \"This has engendered a society bent on self-promotion.\" In some cases, experts said, that has led to cases of bribery and cheating during the exams. While Chinese students may be strong in basic education and passing exams, they are weak in creativity and innovation. Because the system is geared towards getting high scores in exams, students with special talents are often lost as \"under-achievers.\" Many educators now acknowledge the system no longer suits the next stage of China's growth. They consider overhaul of the education system to be critical to China's economic growth and to achieving its goal of competing with the U.S. and other advanced countries in science, technology and innovation. Educational reforms still have a long way to go, but some changes are underway. To relieve students of heavy load, the Ministry of Education last August issued a 10-point decree, stipulating fewer exams, no written homework, no teaching during spare time or holidays and a compulsory hour of physical exercise daily. A long-term blueprint for reform seeks to change the thrust of education by putting a premium on integrating \"learning with thinking\", \"learning with practice\" and \"teaching children according to their aptitude.\" These goals require a change in mindset. \"The knowledge economy does not pay for what you know but for what you can do with what you know,\" said Andreas Schleicher, OECD special advisor on education policy. They also require massive investment in resources. For years, China spent only around 2% of gross domestic product on education, compared with the minimum 6% recommended by the United Nations. Since 1993, I have heard Chinese leaders pledge to raise it to 4% of GDP. It was only last year when they finally lived up to that promise.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:55 PM on 22nd June 2011 . Loophole: Obama's health care law will let millions of middle-class people get nearly free insurance meant for the poor . An anomaly in Barack Obama's controversial healthcare law will allow millions of relatively well-off people to qualify for Medicaid, it emerged today. The loophole, which was only discovered after the complex bill was signed, will give some couples earning four times the federal poverty level entitlement to nearly free insurance meant for the poor. It means a married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $64,000 and still get Medicaid, according to officials who make long-range cost estimates for the Health and Human Services department. After initially downplaying any concern, the Obama administration said late yesterday that it would look for a fix. Up to three million people could qualify for Medicaid in 2014 as a result of the anomaly. That's because, in a major change . from today, most of their Social Security benefits would no longer be . counted as income for determining eligibility. A married couple who have both retired early could have an annual income of about $64,000 and still get Medicaid, it has emerged . Medicare chief actuary Richard Foster says the situation keeps him up at night. ‘I don't generally comment on the . pros or cons of policy, but that just doesn't make sense,’ Foster said . during a question-and-answer session at a recent professional society . meeting. It's almost like allowing middle-class people to qualify for food stamps, he suggested. ‘This is a situation that got no attention at all,’ added Foster. ‘And even now, as I raise the issue with various policymakers, people are not rushing to say ... we need to do something about this.’ President Obama, surrounded by lawmakers, signs the healthcare insurance reform legislation during a ceremony in the the White House on March 23, 2010 . Indeed, administration officials and . senior Democratic lawmakers say it's not a loophole but the result of a . well-meaning effort to simplify rules for deciding who will get help . with insurance costs under the new health care law. Instead of a hodgepodge of rules, there will be one national policy. ‘This . simplification will stop people from falling into coverage gaps and may . cause some to be newly eligible for Medicaid and others to no longer . qualify,’ said Brian Cook, spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and . Medicaid Services. But states have been clamouring for . relief from Medicaid costs, complaining that just these sorts of federal . rules drive up spending and limit state options. The . program is now one of the top issues in budget negotiations between the . White House and Congress. Republicans are pushing for a rollback of . federal requirements that block states from limiting eligibility. Public . opinion: Protesters in California made their views clear. Critics have . also attacked Mr Obama over a system they feel mirrors Britain's ailing . NHS . People hold up signs as they attend a town hall meeting on healthcare reform in California . Medicaid is a safety net program that serves more than 50 million vulnerable Americans, from low-income children and pregnant women to Alzheimer's patients in nursing homes. It's designed as a federal-state partnership, with Washington paying close to 60 per cent of the total cost. Early retirees would be a new group for Medicaid. While retirees can now start collecting Social Security at age 62, they must wait another three years to get Medicare, unless they're disabled. Some early retirees who worked all their lives may not want to be associated with a health care program for the poor, but others might see it as a relatively painless way to satisfy the new law's requirement that all Americans carry medical insurance starting in 2014. It would help tide them over until they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare. The actuary's office said the three . million early retirees who would become eligible for Medicaid are on top . of an estimated 16 million to 20 million people that Obama's law would . already bring into the program, by opening it to childless adults with . incomes near the poverty level. Federal taxpayers will cover all of the . initial cost of the expansion. Heated issue: The debate over healthcare caused violent outbreaks at town hall meetings like this one is Ybor City, Florida in the summer of 2009 . A spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee, which wrote much of the health care law, said if the situation does become a problem there's plenty of time to fix it later. ‘These changes don't take effect until 2014, so we have time to review all possible cases to ensure Medicaid meets its mission of serving only the neediest Americans,’ said Erin Shields. But Republicans already see a problem. Former Utah governor Mike Leavitt said adding early retirees will ‘just add fuel to the fire,’ bolstering the argument from Republican governors that some of Washington's rules don't make sense. ‘The fact that this is being discovered now tells you, what else is baked into this law?’ said Mr Leavitt, who served as Health and Human Services secretary under President George HW Bush.",

A 1,500-year-old amulet has been unearthed in southwest Cyprus that bears a palindrome inscription (pictured), which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. It translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine’ The amulet was found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos and the inscription translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine,’ Livescience reported. It is not the first ancient artefact bearing a palindrome to be discovered. Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Palindromes were possibly used with a similar intention. As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, and Harpocrates, the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool.

As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, Osiris, and Harpocrates (depicted here on a Roman pillar), the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool . The inscription on the amulet, found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos in Cyprus, translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine.’ It was written as a palindrome, which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. There are two small mistakes in the inscription. The 1,500-year-old amulet also bears unusual drawings on the other side. It features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, Osiris and Harpocrates, the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool. The protective charm also has a mythical dog-headed creature called a cynocephalus etched into it, who is mimicking Harpocrates. It is unclear exactly why the images or precise words were chose, but amulets were believed to protect their owners from harm. It is unclear exactly why the images or precise words were chosen, but amulets were believed to protect their owners from harm. The unusual object was discovered in 2011 in the ancient agora – a meeting place – in Nea Paphos, by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. Professor Joachim Śliwa, of the university, wrote that there are two small mistakes in the palindrome, in the study published in the journal, Studies in Ancient Art and Civilisation. The scribe accidentally wrote ‘p’ instead of ‘v’ on two occasions. At the time the amulet was made, Cyprus was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire. Its official religion was Christianity and pagan practices were increasingly clamped down upon. Despite this, people, such as the owner of this amulet, carried on practicing old believes and superstitions. A mosaic dating from the seventh century AD was also found to have pagan elements in it. Leader of the excavation, Professor Ewdoksia Papuci-Wladyka, said that it seems that Christian and pagan religions coexisted in Paphos. However, the pagan drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew. The unusual object was discovered in 2011 in the ancient agora – a meeting place – in Nea Paphos (marked on the map), by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland . Drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew. Professor Śliwa wrote that details may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill. One of the images shows mummified Egyptian god, Osiris (pictured here in a frieze dating to 1,275BC . Professor Śliwa wrote that the animals may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill and have unusual details. For example, he explained that Harpocrates should be sitting on a lotus flower, not a stool, while cynocephalus should not be mimicking the god of silence. He told LiveScience: ‘[In] the classic version, the cynocephalus faces Harpocrates with paws raised in adoration.’ Cross-hatched lines across the two character’s bodies, also suggests that the scribe thought they were mummified, which is incorrect in the case of Harpocrates. A collection of 130 ancient 'curse tablets' featuring gruesome messages of revenge was added to the World Heritage register in June 2014. They include wishes that thieves should go blind and mad, while cheaters become as 'liquid as water.' The nasty messages – known as curse tablets - were written on pieces of lead by victims of theft or wrong doing, and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset. Artefacts bearing palindromes have been discovered in the ancient world. Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' (pictured) have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency . Some messages included magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Others were pierced with nails to achieve a similar result. A total of 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary heritage. In what could be the Roman version of modern-day trolling, the authors poured bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways. One tablet asks for an adversary's intestines to be ‘quite eaten away’, while another one reveals that the victim of a theft of a bronze vessel wanted the cup to be filled with the thief’s blood. The curses, which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of lead and pewter and are addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva. They were cast into the hot springs at Bath, where they were left for the goddess, who was worshiped by Celts and Romans and believed to dispense justice.",

Now it can be revealed that United are discussing a ground-breaking tour of the Far East to supplement an expected visit to the Middle East in January. Neither projects have yet been rubber-stamped by the United board or by manager Louis van Gaal but the club are aware that there are gaps in the calendar that would enable them to make the trips. With United set to return to America for the next summer’s pre-season tour, a post-season venture in May – lasting a week – would bring the clubs some revenue and help sate the appetite of millions of Asian fans who haven’t seen the club’s star players in the flesh since Moyes and his squad travelled to Thailand, Australia and Japan in the July of 2013. In terms of a January game, the Middle East remains the most likely venue for a fixture, possibly against AC Milan, but it is understood United have a number of options open to them in terms of a staging venue and opponents and that no decision has yet been made on whether to pursue a game which could be worth in the region of £3m to the club.

Meanwhile, United midfielder Daley Blind is due to undergo a scan today to assess the extent of knee ligament damage suffered while playing for Holland against Latvia on Sunday.

        "document": "Teacher Priscilla Davo Ortego has been suspended amid allegations she sellotaped children's mouths closed . A primary school teacher has been suspended for Sellotaping over the mouths of her 10-year-old pupils after they refused to stop giggling and talking. Priscila Davo Ortega, 27, allegedly lined up more than 20 children during her art lesson and put layers of sticky tape across their lips because they were being too noisy. Parents said that when some children ripped off the tape because they were struggling to breathe, the Spanish-born teacher replaced it. Other children were left with bleeding lips when the tape was removed, and several said that they were scared about returning to school. Miss Ortega has been suspended from teaching art and Spanish at Danesfield Church of England middle school in Williton, Somerset, pending an investigation. Police said they would work with the local education authority. Parents learned what had happened when their children returned home on Monday. The Year 6 pupils said Miss Ortega imposed the punishment because they were making too much noise while playing a game of blind man’s bluff. Lisa Duffield, said: ‘I was absolutely disgusted when my daughter told me what the teacher had done. I went straight round the school and demanded to speak to Mr Bradbury, the headteacher. ‘I told Mr Bradbury that under no circumstances was my daughter to be taught by her until this matter was sorted out. I didn’t trust myself to speak to the teacher myself, as I feared I might slap her.’ Sarah Gower, 38, of Williton, said: ‘The teacher did not like that they were giggling too loud, told them all to be quiet, and if they weren’t quiet she would put Sellotape over their mouths, which she did. ‘A couple of them had difficulty breathing, so they ripped it off and she put more on top. My son was confused about what happened and he was a bit scared about going to school this morning.’ Upset: Pupil Thomas Bradbury said some friendss had rashes after the Sellotape placed over their mouths to keep them quiet was torn off . Stacey Bradbury, 28, from Watchet, Somerset, said she was ‘disgusted, shocked, traumatised’ by Miss Ortega’s actions. Her . 10-year-old son Thomas said: ‘She put Sellotape on our mouths just . because we were talking. Some people had a really bad rash after and . some girls in my class had their lips bleeding.’ Rob Lovell, 33, of Williton, said his 10-year-old daughter told him Miss Ortega said she was carrying out an ‘experiment’ to see how long the children could be quiet. ‘When my daughter took the tape off her mouth, it split her lips and they were bleeding,’ he said. ‘The same thing happened to quite a few of the pupils. They were all very upset.’ Miss Ortega is from the village of Huetor Santillan, near Granada. She worked as a nanny in London from November 2010 to June 2011, before returning to Spain to complete a master’s degree in secondary education. A teacher has been accused of taping up the mouths of 10-year-olds at Danesfield Church of England School, Williton, Somerset . The teacher has now been suspended and the school has launched an investigation . She did a month-long placement at Danesfield in 2012, and began working there full-time in January. In May last year, she wrote on Facebook: ‘Now for sure, next school year, I will be an art and Spanish teacher in Danesfield School in pretty Sommerset[sic]! A bit nervous but happy.’ Last night, Miss Ortega’s family said she must have acted ‘in jest’ and not to punish the children. Pablo Davo, her uncle, who lives next door to her parents Jorge and Mari Trini in Huetor Santillan, said: ‘Sellotaping children’s mouths up because they’re being noisy would be totally out of character for Priscila. 'Avoid discussion with the media': A copy of a letter to parents of pupils at Danesfield Church of England School . Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they had spoken to one family but added that they would not be taking any further action . ‘She loves her job and she loves children and she never mentioned any problems when she was back here a couple of weeks ago.’ Danesfield School was rated as ‘good’ in its most recent Ofsted report, and the incident happened on the first day of lessons since it became an academy. Headteacher Ian Bradbury said: ‘The wellbeing of our children is of vital importance to us. An incident happened in a lesson on Monday. Following that incident, I have suspended the teacher involved until a full and thorough investigation has taken place.’ Pupils at Danesfield School said the incident came during a 'trust game' where they were led round the room by classmates while their eyes were closed. Speaking outside the school gates, Ryan Knowles, 11, said Ms Davo put . seven pieces of tape on his mouth which remained in place for 25 . minutes. The schoolboy said: 'She told us if we weren't quiet she . would tape our mouths up and then went to the cupboard, got it out and . lined us all up. 'I was thinking and saying to her 'why are you . doing this?' It is ridiculous and it was upsetting. I'm scared now about . if I have to go back into her class. I don't know what she might do . next.' Ryan's father Adam, 34, said the incident flew in the face of the trust he put in teachers to look after his son. The paper mill worker said: 'All those teachers in there are strangers to me, but you have to trust them. Ryan Knowles, 11, said Ms Davo put seven pieces of tape on his mouth which remained in place for 25 minutes . 'But then this happens - it's disgusting.' Lisa Duffield, 42, said her daughter Ella, 11, is refusing to go into class with the teacher again. The shop assistant said: 'It's disgusting. I can't believe it has happened. 'Ella is quite sensitive like lots of girls her age and she was very angry. She said: \"Mum I'm not going back into that class with that teacher ever again\". 'The most upsetting thing about the whole thing is you take them to school trusting they will be looked after by adults. 'I want her gone. This is disgusting. I've been told that the kids are going to get a full apology from the teacher. I hope so. 'If I had done that to Ella and she came into school and told them I would have had social services called.' Cheryl Mills' daughter Jess, ten, told the teacher she was allergic to sticky tape but was still given the punishment. The mother-of-three said: 'I feel very let down. She isn't allergic but she just panicked and didn't know what to do. 'She told her she was allergic but it made no difference. She was one of two kids who took it off. 'Jess was a bit shocked and upset. She didn't know what to say or how to feel.'",

        "document": "London (CNN) -- For table tennis players Pam Fontaine and Tara Profitt, competing at the London 2012 Paralympics marks the climax of a remarkable journey. \"It's really kind of awesome,\" Fontaine told CNN. \"It's kind of surreal, the chances of it happening -- I thought we probably would've done a better job with winning the lottery than for us both to be able to do it again, 20-something years later.\" The U.S. pair first took part in 1984 at Stoke Mandeville, outside London, but then lost touch with each other. They retired from the game to concentrate on other aspects of life -- in Fontaine's case, on her first love, wheelchair basketball. But after each separately decided to take up table tennis again just a few years ago, they were reunited by chance in 2008. Paralympics history comes full circle at London 2012 . In the course of catching up they conjured up a dream: to play together at the London Paralympics, 28 years after they first traveled to the United Kingdom as naive 19-year-olds to represent their country. The idea had an added piquancy because it was Fontaine who had first introduced Profitt to table tennis -- also known as ping pong -- at the Ohio college where they met in 1983. But could they pull it off? It wasn't going to be easy to make the grade for selection nearly three decades later. Aspects of the game had changed, rules had evolved -- and their rivals for coveted spots on the Team USA Paralympic squad could be of any age. What do the Paralympics mean to you? Undaunted, they set about getting themselves back up to speed through dedicated training; Fontaine in the Dallas area and Profitt in her home state of Connecticut, aided by coach Roman Tinyszin. They traveled the globe last year to gain world ranking points in International Table Tennis Federation tournaments, taking in everywhere from Venezuela to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Slovenia and the Netherlands. Fontaine's place in the Team USA squad was confirmed in January this year. Then came an anxious wait to see if Profitt had made it into the last spot in her disability class. Finally the news they had both been praying for came through in March -- she was in. Profitt, 47, was overjoyed by the news. \"It means a lot to me,\" she said. \"The older you get, the more you appreciate the things in life. \" As 19-year-olds, Profitt and Fontaine played singles at the 1984 Games rather than doubles, partly because they fall into different classification bands. The complex Paralympic system is intended to make sure athletes compete against others with the same level of impairment. But this time around they will be competing both individually and in the team event. Fontaine is aware of how much things have changed for Paralympic athletes over the years. \"Back in those days, you had to pay your own way. If you couldn't afford it, you couldn't go, so you had to fundraise,\" she recalled. \"The uniforms were so ugly nobody wanted them.\" Despite more than two decades out of touch, the friends still have many things in common. Fontaine has two sons, one in the military and the other starting college, while Profitt has one; all three boys are very close in age. Profitt is accompanied on the trip to London by her husband, Matt -- who was introduced to her by Fontaine when they were all students at Wright State University, in Dayton. They will celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary in London. Both women were also successful able-bodied athletes before each suffered a devastating accident while a teenager. Before meeting Fontaine in college, Profitt thought she would never practice sport again after a diving accident left her paralyzed from the chest down in 1979. She still appreciates what Fontaine did in introducing her to life as a disabled athlete. Fontaine had played high school basketball before she was paralyzed in an automobile accident at age 16. The impact, in the days before seat belt laws came into force, sent her flying from the passenger seat through the windscreen. She broke her back, among other injuries, but a month after leaving the hospital she was at her first wheelchair basketball practice. \"I didn't have that period of 'Woe is me,'\" Fontaine said. \"I was right back in it.\" Just over a year later, in 1982, she made her first trip overseas to play table tennis. But after competing at the 1984 Paralympics, Fontaine retired from the sport to focus on her beloved hoops instead, eventually retiring as an international basketball player in 2002. Five years later, Fontaine took up table tennis again. She tried for the Beijing squad in 2008 but just missed out on a place. \"I knew I was close to the level, so I said, 'OK -- there's another four years. If I work really hard, try hard, stay on track, maybe I can make the next one.'\" When a fellow table tennis player then put her in touch with Profitt, who had picked up the game again in 2008, their shared dream was born. Since then, they have spoken almost every day, said Fontaine. The fact they are returning to the United Kingdom, where they played in their first Paralympics, makes its realization all the more special. \"It's back where we started -- it's kind of like I went through a full circle,\" said Fontaine. \"We worked really, really had to get where we are and it's been a fun journey for the most part.\" Both are down-to-earth about their achievements, despite their inspirational history. Profitt runs two senior table tennis programs, while Fontaine's work as an adjunct professor teaching kinesiology, the study of body movement, at Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, means she can also share her love of sport. \"I've never really thought of myself as an inspiration -- I just feel that I am blessed to be an athlete. I've been an athlete my entire life,\" Fontaine said. \"If I can help someone along the way, change someone's attitude about people with disabilities, help people to learn something, then that's a good day.\" The chance to represent the United States once again at the Paralympics is a \"true honor,\" she said. \"That is one of the greatest honors you can have as an athlete, to represent your country, and your community, and yourself and your family.\"",

Determined: Laura Britland, 32, pictured here with her scuba instructors Marcus Bancroft (left) and Dave Lowe - has learned to scuba dive despite having no arms so she can swim underwater on honeymoon . Ms Britland uses her feet to tackle everyday tasks at home - but underwater the diving flippers get in the way. So the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so she can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees. She said: 'I was looking for something to do as a challenge and I was spurred on when somebody said I couldn’t do it. It wasn’t easy at first but like everything else if you are determined you’ll succeed. 'If I felt myself getting knocked back I would think about how much I want to dive in the Maldives on honeymoon with Jon.' Technique: Mr Lowe adjusts her breathing apparatus in the pool. Ms Britland uses a special technique which enables her to propel herself through the water, despite her disabilities . Swim: The scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so Laura can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees . Practice: She goes through her paces in the pool. Ms Britland said the attraction of diving was that it is 'peaceful and calm' Ms Britland learned to swim when she was a little girl but only on her back because you need arms to keep your head out of the water. But she said her greatest fear was making the 'giant stride' - the term divers use to describe the moment they step over the edge of a pool or boat into the water. She said: 'Since I was a child I’ve been taught not to fall, as I’d end up flat on my face because I can’t put out a hand to stop me. So stepping forward into the water felt alien to me, but now I’ve got used to making that giant stride. Future: Ms Britland - pictured here with fiance Jon Furness - has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club . 'The other problem was the diving mask, you need a hand to take it off and clear it from water or misting. I had to concentrate on remaining calm when my mask was full of water instead of panicking, as that made it more difficult to clear.' Ms Britland said she developed a technique of looking up and putting her tongue on the roof of her mouth then breathing through her nose to clear the mask. The charity worker, of Rugby, Warwickshire, has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club. She is now planning her first open water dive at the Stoney Cove National Diving Centre, a former quarry, near Leicester. Ms Britland, and  civil servant Mr Furness, 33, are getting married in Sheffield next month and will honeymoon in the Maldives later this year. She was born without arms due to a genetic condition but said her parents refused to treat her any differently to any other child. She said: 'I was born without arms - there’s never been an explanation why, but it seems to be genetic. I’ve never been interested in finding out the reason. 'My parents’ attitude has always been just to get on with it, they never let me say I couldn’t do anything - I couldn’t get out of helping around the house. I use my feet a lot, where other people would use their hands.' She said the attraction of diving for her 'is that it is peaceful and calm, and, when I dive, I feel the same as other people.' Love: The couple are now looking forward to looking at the coral and tropical fish on their honeymoon . Ms Britland is about to take delivery of a custom-made £950 armless dry-suit with buoyancy valves built-in so she can use her chin or knees to adjust them. The zip has also been adapted so she can fasten it herself. Mr Furness, who is also learning to dive, said: 'I’m really proud of her - if you tell Laura she can’t do something she will prove them wrong. I can’t wait to dive together in the Maldives and hopefully have our photograph taken together underwater.' The pair praised diving instructors Marcus Bancroft and Dave Lowe who rigged up the elaborate system that allows Ms Britland to operate her scuba equipment with her knees. Mr Bancroft, 42, said: 'Laura is a brave and inspiring young woman - by the time her honeymoon comes around she will be a competent diver.'",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:48 EST, 6 February 2013 . A federal prison guard allegedly had an affair with an inmate convicted in one of New York's most notorious police killings and became pregnant with his child in an attempt to save him from the death penalty. Nancy Gonzalez, 29, was arrested Tuesday on charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, according to court papers. Wilson was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry. Illegal liaison: Federal prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope' ‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers. Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court. A new jury must decide his fate. But replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty because he is mentally disabled. On Tuesday, Gonzales, who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island home, New York Daily News reported. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted. According to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. According to one inmate, he witnessed the 29-year-old female guard moving away from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . The complaint made public Tuesday and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison. Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?' It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection. 'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.' Insanity claim: Wilson's defense attorney argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped . Wilson was found guilty in December 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island. The following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954. However, an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to be a villain. Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.",

Coffee giant Costa has apologised to a mother who was thrown out for feeding her disabled son. Clair Walker was asked to leave after a customer complained she was put off her latte by 15-month-old Brayden being fed through a tube. Mrs Walker, 29, and her husband, Kenneth, 44, said they were told not to return to the Aberdeen shop after the incident on September 4. Unfair: Clair and Kenneth Walker say Costa coffee discriminated against their disabled son Brayden by asking them to leave the shop . Costa investigated after a friend of the couple posted about the incident on Facebook, prompting an angry reaction. The firm said it had apologised to the family and would deal with the member of staff involved. Staff asked Mrs Walker to leave the Bon Accord shopping centre cafe after a customer complained they 'could hear the wind in his tube'. She said: 'I felt the whole situation was disrespectful but I am pleased that Costa called me to apologise. 'I agree that this is a one-off, isolated situation, caused by one person and not Costa as an organisation.' Disability: Brayden Walker, 15 months, suffers from posterior urethral valves and needs 24-hour care . Brayden suffers from posterior urethral valves, a serious kidney condition, and needs 24-hour care. He is fed by a machine that administers exact quantities of milk and medication through a tube. Mrs Walker added: 'Brayden gets air through it when he feeds. 'The staff said it was making other customers uncomfortable and could we stop and leave. 'They said not to come back - I assumed that meant ever. 'Nobody bats an eyelid when a woman breast-feeds in public - but when you feed a child through a tube they’re outraged. 'I was sickened that someone could be so shallow.' In a statement a Costa spokesman said: 'We are able to confirm that we have now spoken to Mrs Walker, the lady involved, and sincerely apologised for the incident involving her family. 'We will deal with the staff member involved in line with our human resource procedures. We will reinforce our policies around disability to all Costa team members at the earliest opportunity. 'We will increase our focus on teaching staff how to deal better with sensitive situations whatever they may be.' The coffee chain was a partner in a scheme in 2009 that helped disabled people gain work placements and employment. Costa Coffee: Mr and Mrs Walker were asked to leave the branch in Aberdeen's Bon Accord shopping centre . Richard Hamer from Capability Scotland, a campaign group for the disabled, said: 'It seems the everyday lives of disabled children are too much for some people to stomach. 'Costa must take action to show they won’t tolerate such discrimination.' Aberdeen MSP Kevin Stewart said: 'Common sense and courtesy shouldn’t have allowed this.' The Equality and Human Rights Commission for Scotland said that it is possible to look into further action if the Walker family register a complaint.

A crewman has died and 11 others had to be rescued when stormy seas overcame their vessel in the North Sea. The Vos Sailor was damaged and took on water during severe weather overnight. Coastguard launched a rescue mission after a mayday call at 4.30am and 11 crew members were winched to safety. Police said one man was fatally injured however. His body has not yet been recovered. Meanwhile, a major rescue operation took place in Sunderland this afternoon after 15 fishermen were knocked off their feet by waves which crashed over Roker Pier. Scroll down for interactive map of the flooding . A family are caught in sea spray as the sea crashes into the coast in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire with high winds and rain washing away last week's snow . Authorities evacuated residents because of unusually high waters, which also affected other parts of Scotland . The men were fishing on the pier and . a man in his 60s was left with a broken leg following the incident at 1.30pm. He was winched off the pier by helicopter and taken to hospital in Newcastle. Rescue teams were forced to evacuate the other men through a tunnel . underneath the pier. The stricken vessel in the North Sea, which was deployed on the Balmoral Oil . field, sustained significant damage. At present emergency services cannot board the boat, and are trying to return it to shore. 'It appears at this time that one crew member has suffered fatal injuries,' a Grampian Police spokesman said. 'Next of kin have been informed of this situation although no details can be confirmed at this time. 'Efforts are ongoing to recover the vessel which will be brought in to Aberdeen harbour in due course. 'As is normal in such circumstances a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.' Aberdeen Coastguard was contacted . just before 4.30am by a nearby installation who heard the faint mayday, . as stormy weather wreaked havoc across the country. Frightening: Huge waves knocked 15 fishermen off their feet on Roker Pier in Sunderland this afternoon. One man in his 60s sustained a broken leg and was winched to safety by a rescue helicopter. This is a file picture . The . vessel in difficulty sustained significant damage and became disabled . while on standby vessel duties 120 miles Northeast of Aberdeen. Six . other vessels, and three helicopters were sent to the scene. This . includes the Coastguard Search and Rescue helicopter from Sumburgh, an . RAF helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth and Bond 1 – the BP Jigsaw . helicopter. At the time, winds in the area were reported to be south-easterly 60-75 knots with 6.5 metre seas. Non-essential crew on the nearby North Sea Producer, a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, were evacuated to other rigs as a precaution because the disabled boat was drifting. The incident in Sunderland took place at about 1.30pm this afternoon. A total of 15 fisherman were hit by two huge waves, which knocked them off their feet. Bev Allen, watch manager for Humber Coastguard, said: 'We had a number of people on the pier at Roker who were knocked off their feet. One sustained a broken leg and they all had to be evacuated off. 'They were anglers hit by two successive waves which knocked them all over. If anybody had of gone into the water it would have been very dangerous.' The man with the broken leg was winched off the pier by a rescue helicopter while the remaining fisherman were evacuated through a tunnel under the pier. It has now been closed to the public. More than 120 areas across the UK are on flood alert this morning with heavy rain set to lash the country over the weekend. The Environment Agency increased the number of areas at risk overnight as rain continued for a second day. While . the worst affected places are in the South West, 128 areas across the . South East, Midlands, central and northern England, Wales and southern . and central Scotland are also on alert. The . weather has been so severe that pensioners were forced to flee their . homes because of raging coastal floods in Aberdeenshire. High tides and drastic conditions led to 25 people being taken from sheltered housing complexes at Stonehaven. They were taken to St Bridget's Hall in the town, where a rest centre was set up. Further north at Peterhead, about 30 people were evacuated from properties in the Roanheads area. Some stayed with friends while others were given accommodation at a hotel, according to Aberdeenshire Council. People at a care home in Huntly, which . sits inland at the River Deveron, were told to prepare to leave but . later given the all clear. Willie . Munro, of Aberdeenshire Council, said: 'Trained council staff and . emergency services personnel are on hand at St Bridget's Hall to provide . support for the people who have been evacuated. 'High . tide in Stonehaven has passed and, while we continue to monitor the . levels of the River Carron closely, there are currently no concerns that . the river will flood.' Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse . said: 'Local emergency services moved quickly to deal with the aftermath . of the flooding, which was caused by unusually high tides and high . winds, in Stonehaven and Peterhead. 'Emergency staff are also monitoring . the situation at Lossiemouth. They have all demonstrated the utmost . professionalism in the face of very challenging weather conditions. 'Local residents affected by the . floods have been moved to safety and offered support. I want to express . my sympathy for their ordeal.' The heavy rain is expected to stay for the weekend, before a brighter start to the week, although the rain will return on Thursday . A dog walker braves the waters to find a path alongside the floodwater from Pocklington Canal, Sutton upon Derwent, East Yorkshire . Authorities took the action because of unusually high waters, which also affected other parts of Scotland. In Wick, on the far north coast, roads were closed and fishing boats were damaged in high winds. About 12 cars were moved from a car park when a strong surge breached a river bank, police said. Several roads were closed by debris thrown up by the waves. A further 15 areas across the west, as . well as in Northampton and Warrington, are expected to flood, the . Environment Agency said. Around . 30 commercial properties were flooded yesterday in the coastal town of . Looe, south Cornwall, as a band of heavy rain swept in from the . Atlantic. Tom Tombler, . meteorologist for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press . Association, said: 'The heavy rain will affect mostly the western parts . of the the UK and southern England as well as Wales. 'The risk of localised flooding remains throughout the day, especially in areas which saw heavy rain yesterday. 'Between 10mm and 20mm is expected in the worst-hit areas. 'Temperatures will remain milder though, around 10C for most areas.' The heavy rain is expected to stay for . the weekend, before a brighter start to the week, he added, although the . rain will return on Thursday. Firefighters praised the speedy actions of three hunters who found a man desperately clinging to a tree following a flash flood. Early this morning crews were called to a brook, near the River Exe in Devon, which had swollen to around 6ft deep. More than 12 firefighters helped rescue the man, who was taken to hospital suffering with hypothermia. The fire service said it believed he had taken a wrong turn while walking back to his home in Exwick, near Exeter, before slipping into the brook. Sean Faulkner, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Luckily there was a group of three gentlemen who were out hunting and they heard his cries, because it was in the middle of nowhere, and they raised the alarm. 'If it wasn't for the swift actions of the men and the crew it could have been a different outcome.' A spokeswoman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said crews received a 999 call to the incident at around 1.15am today. She also added the service had received around 10 calls relating to flooding within the past 24 hours. Yesterday Plymouth endured 29mm of rain, while Culdrose in west Cornwall received 21mm in 18 hours. The Environment Agency is still advising people to stay away from seafronts, quaysides and jetties along the south coast to avoid powerful waves. A spokesman said: 'The strong winds and high tides can be quite dangerous for people walking along the coast, with waves breaking on to coastal paths.' The combination of warmer temperatures and flash floods have dashed hopes of a white Christmas. Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'It’s mild and wet at the moment and it looks unsettled with showers of spells of rain ahead all the way into January, with low pressure for much of the time. 'There’s no signal for a colder spell in the Christmas period. Temperatures are expected to be around average - and snow is rare in the South in late December. 'There’s always a higher chance of snow on hills and mountains in Scotland and the North, but there’s no indication of a widespread wintry spell.

        "document": "(CNN) -- Tax day is an annual stress test for millions of Americans, but Wednesday's Internal Revenue Service filing deadline may be the toughest one yet for many who can't pay their mortgages or rent, let alone a big tax bill. Jonathan Hermosa wears a costume this week to beckon customers to a tax service office in New York. \"Our message to taxpayers [is] that we're going the extra mile to help those of you in economic distress,\" IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman told the National Press Club in Washington on Monday. \"We want to get you your refunds as quickly as possible. And if you think you can't pay, please come in and let's talk about it. There are steps we can take to help.\" iReport contributor Crystal Gress will need to follow some of those steps. The Coplay, Pennsylvania, bank call center employee said she doesn't know how she's going to pay the $1,200 she owes the IRS. It's the first time she's had a balance due on April 15. \"I'm really scared because I've never had to do it before,\" said Gress, 23. \"I'm used to getting a return, but this past year has been really rough.\"  Watch who's more likely to get audited » . Gress adjusted her withholding last year to increase her take-home pay to cover bills; she intended the change to be temporary, but car repairs and other expenses kept coming up, she said. She used an estimating tool on tax preparer H&R Block's Web site and got the bad news. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap. I owe money.' And I don't know what to do now,\" she said. \"... I waited until yesterday to do my taxes because I didn't want to submit them.\" People who know they're getting a refund tend to file as early as possible, while those with a balance due tend to file late in the season, IRS spokesman John Lipold said.  Watch last-minute tips from CNN's Gerri Willis » . \"A lot of people who were getting refunds in the past are not getting them this year,\" said Brian Joubert, owner of L&B Tax Service with five locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area and Houston, Texas. Because his clients usually pay their preparation fees out of their refunds, Joubert's company has had to make changes to accommodate them, including cutting fees in select cases, holding checks until payday or taking payments in installments. \"We've had more people to pay with a credit card this year than I've ever seen,\" said Joubert, who has been in the tax preparation business for 12 years. \"I feel like a department store in some sense.\" The IRS has a monthly payment plan, but it comes with an upfront fee, stiff penalties and interest, making it more costly than a commercial loan. But a loan isn't an option for Gress, whose credit rating is hurt by lingering debt from admittedly unwise earlier choices. After her monthly rent, utilities and car payment, \"I barely have enough to buy ramen noodles,\" Gress said. iReport.com: Read more of Gress' story . She tried to refinance her $5,000 used car but was turned down, and getting a loan from her family is not an option, she said. Her fiancé doesn't make much at the auto body shop where he works, and she can't work a second job because of long hours at the call center and recent hip surgery. \"I've been looking at every option to pay my taxes,\" she said, acknowledging she'll probably have to go with the costly IRS installment plan. She won't be alone. Between 2 million and 3 million taxpayers a year follow that route, Lipold said.  Watch what protesters are planning for tax day » . Others in similar situations might consider filing for an extension, but they still have to pay extra on any balance not paid by midnight Wednesday. \"Bring your checkbook when you go to file an extension,\" said Amy McAnarney, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. \"The tax that isn't paid by April 15 is subject to interest and penalties, so it's best to pay as much as you can even if you are requesting an extension.\" In rare cases, the IRS will negotiate with the taxpayer and settle for a smaller amount in what is called an offer in compromise. In 2008, the agency worked out 11,000 offers in compromise (out of about 150 million individual returns) worth about $200 million, Lipold said. \"The IRS understands that a lot of people are having problems right now economically and is willing to work with them,\" he said. \"If you're having a problem, call now.\"  Watch how your car could earn you a tax break » . In contrast to Gress, Joe and Patty Lewis are getting a large tax refund for the first time. The Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, couple are due $7,000, which they said they hope will help save their home, which is in foreclosure. Joe Lewis' job as a senior systems analyst was eliminated in January 2008, and at 56 he hasn't found anyone willing to hire him. His $1,800 monthly unemployment benefit -- of which $900 goes to COBRA health care coverage -- runs out at the end of April. iReport.com: Watch Patty Lewis' iReports . Patty Lewis, 55, is a former executive with a furniture company who is disabled and no longer able to work. She first shared her story on iReport.com. The $7,000 is mostly a refund of the penalties they paid when they cashed in Joe's 401(k) and a deduction for their considerable medical expenses, Patty Lewis said. The Lewises are in talks to take that money and a lump-sum payment of her private long-term disability insurance and make a deal with their lender to settle their mortgage debt, she said. \"If I cash it in, I'll be screwing myself by a couple hundred thousand dollars,\" she said. \"But if it's something that's going to save me from foreclosure, I'm willing to do anything I can to secure my home. I'm offering my lender everything that I possibly have. I'm praying to God.\" Until Joe can find a job, \"I'm going to have to live on $900 Social Security a month, which is going to be extremely difficult, but our house is everything to us and it's the only thing that I have to offer,\" she said. Their property taxes are $500 a month, she noted. The couple has filed for mortgage assistance available through national economic stimulus legislation, but Patty Lewis said she doubts they'll get it. \"The administration is not looking at people who have been out of work since this recession started -- December 2007, January 2008. That's when my husband lost his job. And they know that a huge part of foreclosures is due to job loss, but yet they still keep addressing the subprime and adjustable-rate victims,\" she said. \"And there's nothing out there for us at all. ... How can they structure the payments in order for you to pay that mortgage payment every month?\"",

        "document": "The method used to decide whether or not the NHS will fund a drug is should be scrapped, according to a new study. The formula used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) assesses a drug by looking at how much a year's worth of treatment costs compared with the benefits the patient gains in life expectancy and improved health. But researchers, funded by the European Commission, found the system currently used by the UK drugs watchdog is deeply 'flawed'. Flawed? Decisions not to fund drugs such as Herceptin for early breast cancer were reversed after causing huge controversy . The method is known as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and has been used as a template by other countries such as Canada. However, the decisions are often controversial as they affect whether patients suffering illnesses such as cancer can receive potentially life-altering treatments. NICE generally turns down treatments that cost more than £20,000 per QUALY as not cost-effective, which often rules out new revolutionary drugs. Now a team of researchers, led by French doctor Ariel Beresniak, have called for it to be scrapped as it produces the 'wrong results.' 'This isn't a scientific way to classify and prioritise the drugs - mathematically, it's flawed,' Dr Beresniak told the BBC. 'NICE has made negative recommendations about many major innovative drugs, based only on arbitrary incremental cost per QALY.' The researchers added that the method doesn't reflect different views on illness and disability. Dr Beresniak believes the system used by NICE to decide whether to fund drugs produces the 'wrong results' They found these could vary widely after surveying 1,300 European respondents, including 301 in the UK. For instance while 71 per cent of respondents would prefer to live 15 years in a wheelchair than die after ten or five years in a wheelchair, the remaining 29 per cent would rather die earlier. The team suggested that another approach should be considered, perhaps that looked at how many relapses a drug might prevent or how many cases of remission it could provide. The findings were welcomed by a number of charities. James Whale, Chairman of The James Whale Fund For Kidney Cancer said: 'This new research funded by the European Commission underlines what we have been saying about the NICE system of cost of ‘treatment against effect on health and life expectancy’ all along, it is simply incorrect. NICE have to scrap these guidelines now and start giving hope to all cancer patients and put a stop to their ‘flawed’ methodology without fail.' However, a number of British experts have defended the system, saying difficult decisions needed to be made working with a limited budget. Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton Professor of The Public Understanding of Risk, University of Cambridge, said: 'These type of criticisms are not new and do not invalidate what is done by NICE. 'Of course the QALY approach is not perfect, but some mechanism is needed to provide consistent comparisons across different medical interventions, based on aggregate benefit and cost.  Otherwise the money could go to those with the most appealing emotional argument.' Prof John Cairns, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the NICE Appraisal Committee for 10 years, said: 'We . need to be able to compare what we gain by spending in one area with what we . lose by not spending in another area. 'This new project’s suggested . approach of using measures of outcome specific to particular diseases will not . allow us to do that. 'QALYs are certainly not . perfect and we should be looking for better ways of informing decision making . but getting rid of an imperfect system without replacing it with a better one . is not the way forward.' A NICE spokesperson said: 'When we want to find out whether a new treatment provides more for patients than current practice, and whether any improvement in quality or length of life justifies the price the NHS is asked to pay for it, we need to use a measure that can be applied fairly across all diseases and conditions. The QALY is the best measure anyone has yet devised to enable us to do this. 'Economists will argue about the precision of the QALY methods and it’s not perfect. But it’s based on solid research and uses a way of measuring how quality of life changes when using different treatments, which is the best we have available. 'It’s developing and improving all the time and the criticisms in this, rather limited study haven’t shaken our confidence in its value to NICE in helping make decisions on the best way to use new and sometimes very expensive drugs and other health technologies.'",

        "document": "Stephenville, Texas (CNN)The trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle, the protagonist in the top-selling book and hit movie \"American Sniper,\" began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle's own words to bolster an insanity defense. Eddie Ray Routh is accused of killing Kyle and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range at Rough Creek Lodge, about 90 miles southwest of Dallas on February 2, 2013. In his opening statement, defense attorney Tim Moore read a text Kyle sent to Littlefield about Routh as the three men rode in Kyle's pickup truck to the range. \"About an hour and a half into the drive, Chris Kyle was sitting in the driver's seat and he texts Chad Littlefield sitting right next to him. He texts, 'This dude is straight-up nuts,'\" Moore said. \"Chad Littlefield texts Chris Kyle back, 'He's right behind me, watch my six [military lingo for 'watch my back.']. So while we don't know what the conversation was, we do know what Chris Kyle was thinking at the time he was in that truck.\" Moore said Routh killed the two men because he suffered \"a psychosis so severe that at that point in time he did not know what he was doing was wrong. ... He thought in his mind at that moment in time it was either him or them.\" But Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash told the jury that Routh told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning. He admitted that he killed the two men and said he \"knew what he was doing was wrong,\" the prosecutor said. Routh used two guns, Nash said. Routh shot Kyle five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head, using a .45-caliber pistol, and shot Littlefield with a 9 mm pistol four times in the back, once in the hand, once in the face and once in the head, Nash said. A different .45-caliber pistol with all its rounds fired was found on the ground near Kyle's head, Nash said. \"(Kyle) had shot all the bullets in his gun when he was shot in the back,\" said Nash, referring to the fact that Kyle had just fired at a target. The trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. The film has grossed more than $280 million, the most ever for a war movie, and the autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. The first witness with Kyle's widow. Taya Kyle recounted the last conversation with her husband, on the phone. \"I said are you OK?\" she said. \"He said 'yep.' And that's not common for him. I could tell something was up and he was just quiet ...\" On that day, Kyle took Littlefield and Routh, a troubled veteran he was trying to help, to the firing range. Taya Kyle said her husband sounded irritated. \"Normally, going out there, especially a place like Rough Creek -- usually it's beautiful. He feels really good about helping somebody. He's making their day and he knows it,\" she testified. \"Earlier, he thought that guy sounded really excited to go, so he thought he was doing a good thing.\" She said their last conversation \"was very short, and it wasn't short like, 'Hey, you are interrupting a good time.' It was short like, 'I wish I could say more but I'm not going to because there were people around.' \" Later she texted and he didn't reply, and she became worried, she testified. Kyle had already risen to fame through his book when he died. He'd been doing charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated, authorities said. Frank Alvarez, resident manager of Rough Creek Lodge, testified Kyle had \"exclusive access to the range when he came out.\" Kyle had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes, Alvarez testified, but \"about 5 p.m. I got a radio call that said I had to go to the shooting range. Something had happened.\" A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived.  Jurors were shown graphic photos of their bodies. Taya Kyle was in the courtroom at the time. Routh, an unemployed former Marine reportedly diagnosed with PTSD, was gone, and so was Kyle's black Ford pickup, police said. Routh drove up in Kyle's truck at his sister's house 65 miles away, police said. She called 911, telling the operator he claimed to have killed two men. \"They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy,\" Routh's sister told authorities. Routh got back into the truck and hit the road again, police said. Officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a Dallas suburb. While talking with police, he jumped back into the truck and sped off again, police say. They gave chase and stopped him after spiking his tires. He did not struggle when they arrested him, police said. Relatives of Routh, 27, and those close to him declined interview requests from CNN. Routh's attorney is making the case that his client is not guilty by reason of insanity. Since July 24, 2013, when a judge filed a gag order in the case, nobody associated with Routh's trial has been permitted to speak to the media. Before that order was issued, a reporter asked Capt. Jason Upshaw of the Erath County Sheriff's Office what could have driven Routh to the alleged murders. \"I don't know that we'll ever know,\" Upshaw said. Routh served in the Marines from June 2006 to June 2010. His time in the military included a 2007 tour of duty in Iraq and a humanitarian mission to help the victims of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Kyle learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father, then went on to serve four combat tours in Iraq with the SEALs, though his official biography notes he also worked with Army and Marine units. He received two Silver Stars and other commendations before leaving the Navy in 2009 after 160 confirmed kills, which he called a record for an American. He said that while killing did not come easy at first, he knew it meant saving lives. \"The first time, you're not even sure you can do it,\" he said in the interview. \"But I'm not over there looking at these people as people. I'm not wondering if he has a family. I'm just trying to keep my guys safe.\" Kyle's story and the movie made from it have triggered broad enthusiasm but also drawn critics and doubts about his accounts. A sniper's view: 'When you are bred to kill, you know' Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Jason Morris reported from Stephenville, Texas, and Ralph Ellis and Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.",

        "document": "One day last January, Robert Ethan Saylor, a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome, went to see the movie \"Zero Dark Thirty.\"  When it was over, Saylor briefly left the theater, then decided to return and see it again. The manager called security because Saylor didn't pay, and three off-duty deputies, moonlighting at the mall, came in to confront him. According to Frederick County, Maryland, police statements, he swore at them and refused to leave. The deputies tried to remove him, despite Saylor's caretaker's warnings and pleas for them to wait and let her take care of it. What happened next is a little unclear, but witnesses say the deputies put Saylor on the floor, held him down and handcuffed him. Saylor, called Ethan by his family, suffered a fracture in his throat cartilage. He died of asphyxiation. The death was ruled a homicide, but a grand jury failed to indict the deputies and they returned to work without charges. My son has Down syndrome, so I have been following this case closely. But for months, it seemed as if only people in the disability community cared about it. Petitions for independent investigations sputtered out with just a few hundred votes. Local reporting on the case never made a splash in national media. Meanwhile, the Frederick County sheriff investigated his men's conduct, ruled they had followed procedure correctly, and tried to move on. Police violence against people with disabilities is not uncommon, but the cases don't seem to get a lot of publicity. Most people see the disabled as, at best, passive victims, objects to care for, perhaps to love, but not people with whom we automatically identify. This is a mistake. We are all only temporarily able-bodied.  Accidents, illness, and age wait for us all. What happened to Ethan Saylor could happen to you. In July, his death began to get more attention. Heather Mizeur, a member of the Maryland House of Representatives and candidate for governor, seized on Saylor's story and called for new training for law enforcement. Debra Alfarone, an investigative journalist in Washington, began to broadcast and write about the case.  A petition asking Gov.  Martin O'Malley to investigate went viral in mid-August, garnering 300,000 signatures in just a week. This petition fueled a renewed, suddenly national, media narrative. Ethan Saylor and #JusticeForEthan are now an official cause. What's next? An outside investigation either by the Justice Department or as part of a civil lawsuit might piece together the chain of events from the moment deputies confronted Saylor to his death on the cinema floor. We need an unbiased assessment of responsibility, not just to help the Saylor family understand -- although that's important -- but to help all of us understand what went wrong. When law enforcement officers encounter people with disabilities, things can go wrong very easily. Dennis Debbaudt trains police on how to respond to people with intellectual disabilities, and argues that such cases require special tactics. First, he says, law enforcement officers should ensure that they, bystanders and the person with a disability are all out of danger. If the situation is safe, Debbaudt says, officers need to take all the time that's necessary to resolve the problem without force. He tells officers that if the person with a disability isn't \"aggressing into the officer's space,\" then there's generally no good reason to \"aggress into theirs.\" Saylor's aide was asking the officers to wait, rather than handcuff and arrest him, because he hated to be touched. To wait sounds a lot like common sense. According to both the officers' and witnesses' statements, no one seems to have been in danger, a deputy initiated contact only after Saylor swore at them, and witnesses report that the officers remained calm throughout. At worst, taking more time would have inconvenienced other moviegoers -- who, in any event, did not see their movie because of the death. I can't say whether the deputies did anything wrong; in fact, they may have followed their typical procedures to the letter. But with just a little more patience, Ethan Saylor could still be alive. This tragedy raises questions about how people with disabilities fit into society. The Americans with Disabilities Act suggests that employers must offer reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities. That standard has entered the broader culture, even as we repeatedly litigate the meaning of \"reasonable.\" Would it have been reasonable to let Saylor watch the movie for free? Would it have been reasonable to try to talk it out for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, delaying the start of a movie? Would it be reasonable to bar admission to people with disabilities? Making sure we figure out how to safely include people with disabilities throughout our community matters to everyone. Here's a very different story with an equally tragic ending. On August 2, John Wrana, a 95-year-old World War II veteran in Park Forest, Illinois, was scared. He didn't want to go to the hospital for surgery, because he didn't want to end up on life support. The staff at his assisted living community decided to involuntarily commit him and called the police. He threatened the staff with a shoehorn and a cane. The police came. They shot him with a Taser and and fired beanbag rounds at him. He died. The Park Forest police say, \"Attempts were made verbally to have the resident comply with demands to drop the articles, to no avail.\" The police claim he had a kitchen knife, but the family disputes this, saying there was no knife in the old man's room before the incident. Unlike Robert Ethan Saylor, John Wrana was not born with a disability. He made it through WWII with his body intact. But he was only temporarily able-bodied, then age caught up with him.  Once in the world of disability, confused and stripped of his power to govern his body, he encountered the police and was killed. Disability rights are universal human rights, not abstract principles. But if it takes a personal reason to care about rights for the disabled, remember this: You might need them someday.",

        "document": "By . Louise Cheer . A quadriplegic man had to leave his wheelchair behind when an airline told him he could not bring it onboard. Peter Darch, a former West Australian of the Year, was travelling from Perth to Bali with his wife, parents and grandparents when he was approached by the same Air Asia staff who had checked him in an hour before takeoff to say they would not stow the wheelchair. His wife, Azucena, was forced to stay at the airport overnight and wait pay $700 for a flight on another airline who did allow her take the foldable, electric wheelchair with her. Peter Darch, 29, was not allowed to bring his electric wheelchair on board an Air Asia flight last Tuesday . The 29-year-old said he was 'disgusted' by the move. Mr Darch, from Mundurah, Western Australia, who was 2011's Western Australia Young Person of the Year, has complained to the Australian Human Rights Commission about last Tuesday's incident, saying it was disability discrimination. Initially the airline cited the wheelchair's batteries as the reason why they could not let it onboard. But despite having a dangerous goods certificate that ruled the batteries safe for travelling, the airline still refused to take it. Mr Darch said he tried to compromise by offering to remove the batteries and repurchase some in Bali. The wheelchair, similar to the one above, was instead taken by his wife to Bail after she forked out $700 for another flight . 'The airline’s response was no, that even without the battery – which had originally been used as the reason the chair could not travel on the airline – it would not be allowed in the cargo hold,' he told Perth Now. Mr Darch also said the size of the chair was not an issue as it could be folded down to a size that was 'not much bigger than a suitcase'. Furthermore, when asked if he could use one of the airline's airport wheelchairs to transport him to his Bali hotel, he was also told 'no'. Air Asia has denied Peter Darch was discriminated against by staff at Perth Airport . To get around, Mr Darch had to hire a wheelchair from a travel company in Bali. Unfortunately this is not the first case Australian Disability Discrimination Commissioner Graeme Innes was aware of. Mr Innes said it was potentially a breach of legislation if an airline refused to carry a person's mobility aid. In a statement, Air Asia denied Mr Darch had been discriminated against. A spokesperson said their website had a strict policy on the storage of battery-operated wheelchairs and mobility devices.",

To his colleagues and staff who watched him up close year after year, and to millions of Americans who saw him fighting on so many fronts, he was a committed champion of equality, justice, peace and protection of those in need. How did he do it? With incredibly long hours, amazing energy and hard work, coupled with a zest for politics -- in the best sense -- and legendary legislative mastery acquired over the years. His staff knew that when he was starting an initiative, his first priority instinctively was to win over as staunch a conservative as he could find to be his partner and original co-sponsor. It worked so many times. Sometimes, he would leave an evening event where he was the honoree before it had ended. The next day, a cynical scribe might note that shortly after receiving his award, \"Kennedy bugged out early.\" I knew that the senator had gone home to be able to help his son with homework or put him to bed, and then had begun a late-night briefing with staff to prepare for an important hearing the next morning. Finally, over a life of personal trials and tribulations, Kennedy had developed great \"empathy\" -- a word recently much maligned, but all-important in the Senate's staid, marble halls. He had endured the physical and emotional pain that enabled him to feel the pain of illness, discrimination or disability endured by others. You could see that he did, as he gently helped a tearful witness through difficult testimony at a Senate hearing. Kennedy knew well that on Capitol Hill you tried for a full loaf, sometimes took half of one and, if necessary, you planted the flag, took a slice and came back another day for more. But he also remembered Frederick the Great's admonition: \"L'audace, toujours l'audace (boldness, always boldness.)\" The 1965 Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of modern civil rights laws, revolutionized America. In small Mississippi towns and elsewhere in the South where African-Americans once feared walking past the sheriff's office, they now may be the elected sheriff, mayor or state senator. The same is true for Hispanics in parts of the Southwest. The Act's two main parts are Section 2 and Section 5. Section 2 is a permanent, nationwide prohibition against electoral discrimination. Section 5 requires preclearance by the U.S. attorney general of election law changes in jurisdictions covered by the provision. From the beginning, Section 5 was controversial and was set to expire in 1982. In 1980, however, a Supreme Court ruling had gutted the equally important Section 2 with a statutory misinterpretation. Kennedy had to decide which section to save. The nation's civil rights coalition urged him to go for both. Many Democrats warned that trying to preserve both was a bridge too far and that Kennedy would risk losing everything. After much debate, and uncertainty, he firmly decided to go for broke, and \"ran the table.\" Section 5 was preserved for another 25 years, while the statutory clarification of Section 2, combined with the 1990 census, dramatically increased the number of minority members of Congress. Kennedy was interested in results. At the outset of Watergate, long before it became a constant headline, he and his staff started the Senate investigations, fully apace with the Washington Post, and unearthed the \"dirty tricks project\" of the 1972 Campaign. But he came to realize that a Kennedy was not the most appropriate person to chair hearings on the Nixon White House and supported Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's creation of the select \"Ervin Committee\" to finish the job. Kennedy's intense pursuit of the causes he championed was matched by his fabled sense of humor. I enjoyed both his huge store of anecdotes and his gentle barbs, except when I was the target. Sitting in the back of the Senate chamber behind him and Sens. Edmund Muskie, Walter Mondale, Eugene McCarthy and Phil Hart while they regaled each other with the foibles of Washington was a treat that helped lighten the often tense atmosphere of debate on heated issues. Occasionally, he missed the humor in the situation, especially if advance work for his events wasn't up to his standards. I remember Kennedy rebuking Bob Shrum, his speechwriter, and me for running late as he weaved through traffic from his suburban home to an interview by civil rights leader and radio host James Farmer. Shrum kept assuring him that the interview would be prerecorded and could be taped whenever they got there. Then, at a stoplight, a cabbie leaned out his window and yelled: \"Hey Ted, you're late. They're all waiting for you.\" It turned out that, because Kennedy had been in the news a lot, Farmer had decided to do the interview live on his daily show. Needless to say, Kennedy did not laugh. Superseding these and many other recollections of Kennedy the senator is my vivid memory of him as a person uniquely able to distract and comfort others in distress. On time stands out. When my first Senate boss, Phil Hart, was in the last stages of his battle with cancer, Kennedy spent hours by his side offering humor, Irish tales and Senate banter almost endlessly, as Chris Dodd and many others have now done for him. Hopefully, we will see his like again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Burton Wides.",

        "document": "By . Ted Thornhill . A bridegroom who raped a teenage girl on his wedding night while his pregnant wife slept in the next room was jailed for 18 years today. William Jordan carried out the sickening attack when he was 18 after tying the knot at Hammersmith town hall in west London. The newlywed couple had spent the night celebrating at a friend’s home with other friends and family before turning in. Jailed: William Jordan was sentenced to 18 years in jail for raping two girls in the 1970s . He had snuck out of the bed he was sharing with his wife and raped a 14-year-old girl. His victim was too terrified to tell anyone what had happened and blocked out the memory for years to come. Jordan, who is now 59, has finally been brought to justice 41 years after the attack, which took place on April 20, 1973. In 1977 Jordan began abusing another young girl when she came to babysit his two children once a month, the Old Bailey heard. When he and his wife went to the pub Jordan would sneak away and rape the 11-year-old at his home before going back ‘as though nothing had happened’. The attacks carried on for the next two years. The judge, Mr Recorder Oliver Sells, QC, branded Jordan a ‘devious, predatory abuser’ as he sentenced him to a total of 18 years imprisonment. The judge said: ‘On your wedding night after a ceremony at the town hall you and your new wife, who was heavily pregnant and only 16 years of age, retired for the night to the house of some friends. ‘During that night, your wedding night, you went into the room of the child and raped her forcefully. ‘She has blocked out that incident from her mind and was unable for good and powerful reasons from speaking about it and has for many, many years kept silent.’ He continued: ‘After the wedding in 1973 you and your wife had children. ‘As they grew up an 11-year-old girl came over to your house to babysit about once a month over a two-year period. ‘She already had a miserable home life, a violent father and uncaring mother. She told the jury that she loved your two children and being with them was for her a brief escape. ‘You knew all this and yet you abused your position of power. ‘When you and your wife went out to the public house you would pop back to your home and rape that young child before going back to the pub as though nothing had happened. ‘This state of affairs only ended when the child was taken into care.’ The judge added: ‘She told the jury there was no one she could tell and no one who would believe her. ‘If she had told what you did she would be beaten and treated even more badly. Ordeal: The judge praised the victims' dignity and courage in speaking out and giving testimony at the trial (picture posed by model) ‘Both these women’s childhoods were blighted and their lives remain affected to this day by your conduct.’He commended both the women for their courage in speaking out and ‘fighting their demons’. ‘They both endured decades of undeserved silence, shame and suffering,’ Judge Sells said. ‘You enjoyed decades of undeserved freedom, status in your family and the power of an abuser. ‘Finally they both in middle age found the courage to speak out. They gave their evidence in open court in full view with great dignity. ‘They fought their demons and gave a compelling account of what you had done to them.’ He added: ‘You were a devious, predatory abuser of children over a period of years.’ Judge Sells continued: ‘It’s clear the jury found their accounts moving. ‘I hope they [the victims] now feel the justice to which they are entitled has been done.’ The court heard Jordon was convicted of another sexual offence in 1980. Defence barrister Tim Starkey said he suffers from a number of health conditions including epilepsy. Jordan, from Hammersmith, denied the charges, but was convicted by a jury of three counts of rape. He will remain on the sex offenders register for life.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a formality, but the Netherlands was made to sweat against Costa Rica before eventually overcoming the 2014 World Cup's surprise package and booking a place in the semifinals Saturday. Substitute goalkeeper Tim Krul was the hero, saving two penalties to secure a 4-3 shootout victory after this tense, nervous quarterfinal finished goalless. Incredibly, the Newcastle man was brought on in the 29th minute of extra time with the sole job of denying \"Los Ticos\" in the spot-kick showdown. It earned the Dutch a second consecutive semifinals appearance, having lost to Spain in the title match four years ago. Now the aim for Louis van Gaal's men is to go one better than in South Africa. Standing in their way of another final appearance will be Argentina, which defeated Belgium in the day's earlier game thanks to a solitary early goal from Gonzalo Higuain. Wednesday's clash will be a repeat of the 1978 final, which Argentina won 3-1, and the dramatic 1998 quarterfinal in which the Dutch triumphed thanks to a spectacular Dennis Bergkamp winner. On the performances of both teams Saturday, it will be difficult to pick a winner. Belgium coach Marc Wilmots described Argentina as \"ordinary\" in his post-match press conference earlier in the day. Likewise, there was little that was obviously special about the Dutch against Costa Rica -- but Van Gaal's players have recorded some impressive results at this World Cup so far. A thrilling 5-1 demolition of reigning world champion Spain was followed up with two closely fought victories over Australia and Chile. The round of 16, meanwhile, produced a dramatic late win over an impressive Mexico side in the oppressive heat of Fortaleza. In Arena Fonte Nova, Salvador, the Oranje was faced with another Latin American opponent -- a Costa Rica team which was only the fourth side from the CONCACAF region to reach a World Cup quarterfinal. Solid defensive displays and tactical astuteness from its wily manager, Jorge Luis Pinto, had brought Los Ticos this far. Nobody expected them to get out out of a pool containing Italy, England and Uruguay, let alone as group winners. A heroic display with 10 men against Greece in the round of 16, winning a shootout, ensured Pinto's team would progress further than ever before. But in Van Gaal, Pinto had met his match. The Dutch master, who will take over the reigns at Manchester United once the World Cup is over, is one of the most celebrated European coaches of the last 30 years. Throughout the tournament he has switched his style, tactics and personnel depending on the demands of the opponents. A rapid counter-attacking style was deployed against Spain to devastating effect while striker Dirk Kuyt was effectively utilized as a defender against Chile to stifle the South Americans' impressive forward line. Here, Van Gaal adopted a similarly prudent approach. Both sides started cautiously, standing off and refraining from pressing until entering each other's territory. Whether this was down to a mark of respect or a pacing exercise in the Salvador heat was unclear, but the Dutch were the first to break the tentative rhythm. Robin van Persie was played through by Memphis Depay but Keylor Navas, who has performed admirably throughout the tournament, blocked low to his left before springing up to gather Wesley Sneijders follow-up. Moments later Navas was at it again, saving low from Depay who had been set up by Van Persie. Costa Rica had its own chances, though they were less clear cut. A series crosses peppered Jesper Cillessen's goal but there was little to concern the men in orange until a flick from Celso Borges bounced invitingly across goal with no Costa Rican striker to tuck home. The Dutch responded with a free kick from Sneijder that was spectacularly clawed away by Navas shortly after. After the break, both managers looked to break the stalemate by shuffling their pack. Marcos Urena replaced Joel Campbell up front for Los Ticos while the Dutch also made a striking change, taking off Depay for Jeremain Lens. Then, just as it seemed the game would never break from a crawling pace, it burst into life. Arjen Robben, who Costa Rica looked to double up on all night, burst forward and, despite accentuating what was minimal contact from Giancarlo Gonzalez, won a free kick on the edge of the box. Sneijder stepped up and rattled the post with a vicious swerving shot before the ball was eventually cleared. All of a sudden, the Dutch were energized and Los Ticos were rocking. Another free kick caused chaos in the Costa Rica box and the ball dropped to Van Persie, who fired in a shot that Navas again did well to block. As the clock struck 90 minutes the Dutch had their best chance of all as Daley Blind's low cross evaded everyone until it landed at the feet of captain Van Persie at the back post. The Manchester United striker struck the ball goalwards with Navas stranded but his shot was met by the retreating, Yeltsin Tejeda who somehow used his body to deflect the ball onto the bar and away. After what was for so long a sterile contest, the brief break before extra time barely seemed enough for the now clearly tiring players to catch their breath. The Dutch again started on the front foot as Navas made another fine save from a Ron Vlaar header. From the resultant corner, the keeper was almost caught out as he flapped at Sneijder's cross. Klaas Jan Huntelaar was introduced at the break for defender Bruno Martins Indi as Van Gaal attempted to avoid the dreaded penalty shootout. The striker, whose injury-time penalty won the day against Mexico,was soon booked for crashing into Navas when challenging for a high ball. Costa Rica threatened next as substitute Urena broke free at the edge of the box, working a yard of space before firing a low shot that Cillessen dived to push away. Even closer was to follow at the other end. As the clock ticked down, Sneijder peeled away at the far edge of the box before setting himself and unleashing another brilliant curling strike. For once Navas was helpless. But again the woodwork came to his rescue as the midfielder's shot bounced away of the crossbar. Penalties it would be -- but not before Van Gaal took the unorthodox decision to replace Cillesen with Krul for the shootout. \"There is no question about who will start next game, it will be Cillessen,\" Van Gaal said. \"But we felt Krul was the better choice here. \"We told Krul that he would be a possibility for the penalties, but we didn't tell Cillessen, as we didn't want to ruin his preparation.\" It was a bold call that would prove decisive. Krul prowled around his area in an attempt to psyche out the Costa Rica penalty takers, pointing to his eye to let them know he'd done his homework. Maybe he had, maybe he hadn't. But his efforts to unnerve his opponents worked. Krul first dived low to his left to save from Bryan Ruiz and when Dirk Kuyt drilled the Netherlands' fourth spot-kick home, Michael Umana knew he had to score to keep his side in the competition. Sadly for Umana and the tiny Central American nation of five million souls, he couldn't, as Krul again went low to his left to push the spot-kick round the post and end the dream of these most valiant of underdogs. \"We cannot blame anyone because to be there at that time is not easy,\" said Navas, who was named man of the match for the third time at Brazil 2014. \"Our rivals did their job in the penalty shootout and we didn't.\" Pinto admitted his team had been \"lucky throughout the game\" but expressed his great pride. \"We are not a world football power but we have done very important things here,\" the Colombian said. \"We go home proud of what we have done and I want to express my gratitude to the Brazilian people.\"",

        "document": "It’s barely 11am on a sweltering Saturday morning in Memphis, Tennessee, and the air is thick with the smell of charred meat. A nearby loudspeaker blasts out Eighties rock while, all around me, men in stetsons and sunglasses sweat over enormous steel cookers billowing smoke. Welcome to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest – aka the ‘Super Bowl of Swine’ – where it’s never too early to fire up the grill. 'Barbecue virgin' Alice-Azania Jarvis gets stuck in to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest . A team of butchers from Asda travelled to Memphis, to barbecue with the best in the world . The fierce cooking competition attracted 100,000 entrants and visitors . Now in its 36th year, the competition attracts more than 250 entrants who battle it out across dozens of categories – from best ribs to best chicken wings - for cash prizes of up to $50,000 and, ultimately, the chance to be crowned Grand Champion of Barbecue. Teams with names such as The Notorious P.I.G., Lords of the Swine and The Grandmasters of Cooking Disasters have been here since Thursday, setting up their stalls in preparation for today’s extravaganza. The competition grounds – a mile long stretch of grass along the Mississippi river – are heaving with the 100,000 barbecue fans and spectators who’ve paid $10 a head to be here. As competition organiser Diane Hampton - a businesslike woman in khaki trousers and horn-rimmed glasses - puts it: ‘This is the granddaddy of grill contests.’ To a barbecue virgin such as myself, it’s all a little overwhelming. I’m here because, as well as teams from virtually every US State, there is one lonely British delegation, who’ve entered two categories: beef brisket and best ribs. Sent by the supermarket ASDA, the nine-strong group – six men, three women, all ASDA employees - is hoping to take on the Yanks at their own game. And let’s get one thing straight – it is very much their own game. Because you can forget charred sausages and limp burgers - this is Southern Barbecue in all its smoky, super-sized glory. Here, great slabs of meat are slow-cooked over wood fires for up to 18 hours at a time. The fat of the meat melts slowly, keeping it tender, while the wood infuses it with flavour. Alice-Azania Jarvis samples some of the delicacies the competition has to offer . Cooked to perfection: Meat is slow cooked for up to 18 hours and judged by how tender it is . Alice tries some of the beef brisket and ribs cooked up the British Asda team . It’s a culinary art dating back to . the Wild West, and every town across the South has its own version – . from Memphis’s sticky ribs to North Carolina’s pulled pork. All are represented here, cooked by teams of red-faced men armed with tongs and lots and lots of beer. Each one has its own pitch, where . they have erected their barbecue along with plastic chairs, tables, . gazebos and huge tarpaulin banners bearing their team’s name. Most have . wired up their own sound system, too – hence the Eighties rock. Looking around, I can’t help but think . our British team – authentic as their beef brisket and ribs may look - . stand about as much chance of winning as Eddie the Eagle at the Winter . Olympics in 1988. But Mark Richmond, a former professional chef who now works for ASDA’s recipe team and is heading up the British contingent, is confident. ‘No matter what anyone says, we’re here to win – and I think we can.’ He has been practicing since this time last year, even setting up a barbecue in the car park of ASDA’s Leeds headquarters. By lunchtime, the aroma of pork ribs and beef brisket hanging in the air, my appetite is getting the better of me. Disappointingly, the meat being grilled by competitors is reserved for the competition judges - but a strip of food trucks running through the middle of the site is a meat-lover’s paradise. There are dozens of stalls offering everything from chicken wings and pulled pork to ribs and burgers. Master butchers sharpen their knives ahead of the competition . Each of the 285 entrants have their own specialty from sticky ribs to pulled pork . About 100,000 barbecue fans turn up to the competition to sample the huge range of griddled meats . I . plump for half a dozen ribs, slaw and beans. Sticky and sweet, they . come in an enormous plastic box. There’s nothing for it but to stand in . the middle of the festival grounds and tuck in. They’re messy – but . delicious. ‘This was my father’s recipe,’ explains Karla Willingham, a 44-year-old teacher who sells the ribs from . her brightly-painted wagon. ‘He taught me how to barbecue when I was a . little girl – we’re here every year.’ Alongside . the endless food stalls, there is all manner of barbecue-centric . merchandise to be picked up. T-shirts emblazoned with ‘Grillmaster’ and . ‘The Fame is the Flame’ sell like hotcakes while elsewhere you can buy . butcher’s knives, barbecue tongs and rhinestone-encrusted cowboy hats. As the day wears on, and the mercury soars over 30 Celsius, a mood of focussed calm descends over the competitors. Many here are seasoned hands on the . barbecue circuit (yes, there is such a thing – Memphis’s World . Championship is the crowning jewel in a calendar of similar events . across the South, from Kansas to the Carolinas). Competition is fierce . and every team has its own ‘secret’ for success. This . is the 10th year that Memphis oil refinery workers Lee Smith,39, and . Todd Swirka, 41, have entered. Their team is called Refined Swine, and . their grill is shaped like a huge cylindrical drum. They built it . themselves. Says Lee: ‘It's the highlight of the . year. We enjoy cooking and there's camaraderie between the teams. We're . entering the ribs - we have our own dry rub on it. That's the trick - . but we can't tell you what's in it.' The . seven judges allocated to each team are no less dedicated. In . preparation for today, they have undergone eight hours of training – . taking in everything from animal anatomy to lessons in meat texture. Entrants come up with a range of imaginative names including the Notorious P.I.G and Lord of the Swine . The barbecue Memphis meat fest is not suitable for vegetarians . BBQ kings: Jason Kobeck (left) and Mark Morris of team Refined Swine at the Super Bowl of Swine . Judging is a complex combination on . stall inspection (teams get points for cleanliness) and a blind taste . test in an enormous tent at the heart of the festival site. ‘There . are three things we look for: appearance, tenderness, and taste,’ says . Ron Childers, a local weatherman who has been judging barbecue contests . in his spare time for more than a decade. Munching through all that meat, he says, can be daunting. ‘I always put on a couple of pounds at competition time – you just take two bites of each entry but you end up consuming a lot.’ Finally, though, more than six hours after they begin, Ron and co are ready to give their verdict. As the sun sets over the banks of the Mississippi, an excitable local news anchor named Brian Basham takes to a stage in the centre of the site to announce the winners. The top ten in each category traipse up one by one to whoops of applause and the odd yell of 'we love pork'. In all, the ceremony takes almost two hours - not that anyone seems to mind. The British team don’t quite make it up– finishing 39th (out of 108) in the beef brisket category and 67th (of 121) in the pork ribs. Those are won by Fireman John's, a group from Madison in Mississippi headed up by, yes, a fireman named John, and High Life on the Hog, from nearby Corvada, respectively. And the Grand Championship – awarded to whoever scores highest overall, regardless of category – goes to Sweet Swine of Mine, from Olive Branch in Mississippi, who also won the Pork Shoulder category. Nevertheless, Mark and his team are satisfied: 'It's about the learning. We're competing against the kings of Barbecue - and one day we'll be one of them. We'll be back next year.'",

        "document": "By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 14:13 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:32 EST, 24 September 2013 . Struck off: Thomas Floyd was once seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid . A pediatric dentist who last year pleaded guilty to abusing a four-year-old patient already had a string of accusations on his record spanning eight years, which included hitting children with dental tools, calling them names and performing unnecessary dental work, it emerged today. Thomas Floyd, 62, from Florida, was arrested last September and, under a plea deal, was sentenced to five years probation and agreed to relinquish his dentist license. Under the agreement, the state agreed not to pursue additional charges against Floyd from any other known victims from his former dental practice. One of Floyd's former dental assistants told police the 62-year-old . jammed a dental tool into four-year-old boy's mouth with such force that blood . squirted out. Roger Zacharie told police last year: 'Blood squirted up. He'd slap again. Boom. \"Open up\". 'You know and then he's — he slapped one more time, which was the third slap. And I couldn't take it because blood squirted all on my shield and his shield.' For most of his career, which spanned three decades, Floyd was seen as a champion of dental care for poor children due to his willingness to accept Medicaid. But after a number of complaints of child abuse were lodged against him, the Department of Health launched an investigation. They found that in 2011, during a seven-month period alone, Floyd allegedly called children names, including 'cry baby', 'ape' and . 'brat', pinched a two-year-old and gave a four-year-old eight crowns without her parents' consent. The report also revealed the department received an anonymous complaint stating . Floyd abused children in his office 'by putting his hand over their . mouths and calling them names'. Documents obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel detail a string of allegations going as far back as 2001 with similar accusations. Claims: Children who were treated at Floyd's dental practice and their parents made various allegations over the last decade which included being hit by dental tools, being verbally abused and having healthy teeth extracted . One father said he took his child for a routine clean and check up and Floyd pulled three good teeth. 'It's horrifying that your daughter goes . in for a dental cleaning and comes out missing teeth,' the father . Benjamin Rodriguez told the Sun Sentinel. '[Floyd] just didn't care.' Eight former employees told police they saw . Floyd hit or become overly aggressive with crying and disabled children and would hit them with dental tools. The most recent police inquiry came . about in February 2012 when the mother of a seven-year-old girl reported to . police that her daughter went to have four teeth extracted and came out . with beads from her braids missing and her clothes wet. Rovenia Gerald told the Sun Sentinel that Floyd had stuffed a . dental bib in her daughter's mouth to stop her from screaming and told . her, 'Shut up you damn brat!' According to the investigation released by the Department of Health, 'Floyd’s behavioral control methods with his patients fall well below acceptable standards of practice in treating pediatric patients'. Floyd's attorney said the allegations stem from disgruntled former employees and those of his ex-wife, who is an orthodontist. Floyd himself said he was the victim of a 'witch hunt', in a letter he sent to the Florida Department of Health last year, and claimed his Medicaid patients who had severe dental, medical and behavioral problems oftentimes had difficult parents.",

        "document": "A $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that funds the government through September won approval Wednesday from the Republican-led U.S. House and now goes to the Senate for consideration. The appropriations measure, approved 359-to-67, would roll back some past spending cuts, raise federal worker pay and touch the everyday life of all Americans. Compromise on the fiscal year 2014 spending bill is a break from years of congressional funding fights that included a government shutdown last October. The Senate is expected to also pass the so-called \"omnibus\" bill and send it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. Wielding the power of one of the biggest purses in the world, the measure sets America's national and international priorities. In the partisan atmosphere of an election year, the spending bill may be the largest policy decision Congress makes in 2014. It calls for 1% increases in the paychecks of federal workers and military personnel, the first raises in three years for most agency workers. The spending measure also would protect disabled veterans and some military spouses from a pension cut set to go into effect in 2015. Appeal for both sides . Democrats like a $1 billion increase in Head Start funding for early childhood education from its recent low point after forced budget cuts last year. Half of the money will go to help children 3 years old and younger, touching on an Obama administration priority. For Republicans, the compromise reduces funding to two of their least-favorite agencies -- the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, federal spending would be lower than the final budget of President George W. Bush's administration. Changes at the airports may be the most visible Republican idea in the bill. The measure launches several policies aimed at forcing the Transportation Security Administration to get more low-risk passengers through security more quickly. Obamacare mostly untouched . Obama's signature health care reforms avoided any harsh cuts sought by conservative Republicans hoping to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act. On another controversy, the spending plan requires Secretary of State John Kerry to certify the Libyan government is helping find those responsible for the 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi before any more foreign aid goes to the country. The bill also contains countless smaller provisions such as a ban on funding any new portraits of most officials. Current funding under a continuing resolution that extended spending at previous levels expires on Wednesday, and Congress passed a further three-day extension to give the Senate time to vote on the compromise 2014 bill later this week. Obama later signed the stopgap measure, which will fund the federal government through Saturday.",

        "document": "By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 10:11 EST, 17 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:26 EST, 18 September 2013 . A heroic Washington Navy Yard employee has recounted the moment he raced to the aid of a blind co-worker as bullets rang out around them before leading him to safety. Omar Grant was photographed holding the arm of his colleague, identified only as Linwood, and leading him away from the building after Aaron Alexis opened fire on Monday morning, killing 12. The touching image, captured by a Yahoo! News reporter at the scene, has already become a symbol of the astonishing acts of kindness and bravery amid such terror. Grant, an IT technician, recalled how he had just arrived at work and was standing in the atrium when he heard bullets echoing through the Navy Yard complex. He froze as people began running. Support: He continued to tell Linwood where they were going and that he would not leave him alone . 'As soon as we got outside the cafeteria . doors into the hallway, we saw people panicked, running for the exits,' Grant told the Today show. 'They were shouting. I couldn't make out exactly what they were . shouting, but I knew it was something serious.' But his first thought was not for himself; he was near a visually-impaired colleague with a walking stick who was struggling to get away from the scene. 'He moves sometimes rather slowly so people are usually helping him and escorting him,' Grant told CBS. 'This time, he was all by himself. I did not want to leave him behind.' Grant approached Linwood and held on to his arm. 'I said, \"This is what we are going to do,\" and I'm describing where we were going,' Grant said. 'I told myself, \"I'm not going to leave you, we're going to get out of here\".' Heroic: Omar Grant, pictured, said he told Linwood he would not leave him and led him to the train station . Together: Linwood, center, was interviewed at the scene and said all he was thinking was 'home' Together they walked from the building as other workers scrambled for safety and police swarmed the scene, eventually shooting the gunman dead. As the men left the scene, a reporter approached them and asked what was going through Linwood's mind when he heard the shots. 'Home,' he said, smiling. 'That's all I needed.' Grant helped him walk from the base to the nearby Metro station and escorted him to the train. Speaking to CBS, Grant said he was shaken by the day's tragic events. Fears: Workers hold their hands to their heads as they are escorted out of the building where the gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday morning, killing 12 people . Chaos: More than 3,000 people work at the site in Washington D.C. where gunfire erupted on Monday . Relief: Edith Hutchins kisses her husband Shawn Hutchins as she picks him up after he was evacuated . 'I'm here tonight with my family, and . I'm thinking of those people that aren't with theirs,' he said. 'Could I . have done something that could have helped them - some of them make it . home.' But he added that if he sees Linwood . again, he wants to tell him that he can always be sure that Grant will . be there to help him. Twelve people were shot dead during Alexis' shooting spree on Monday morning. The 34-year-old civilian contractor was shot dead by police inside the building. Alexis had been working as a civilian contractor for Hewlett-Packard as it performed an upgrade on the equipment at the site, the company confirmed to NBC on Monday. Traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage on 9/11, Alexis didn't sleep for days afterwards and later developed Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome - possibly as a result of what he saw at ground zero . Heartbreak: A candle-lit vigil is held on Freedom Plaza to remember the shooting victims on Monday night . He had previously served in the Navy . Reserve but had a history of gun charges, and investigators said that he . may have recently lost his job with Hewlett-Packard.

        "document": "A year before two Vanderbilt football players were convicted in a 2013 gang rape, campus officials concluded there was a lack of evidence that 'nonconsensual sexual intercourse' had occurred. The report from the Tennessee school's Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action and Disability Services Department led to the expulsion of Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Baty and two other players. However, Vanderbilt has refused to release its on-campus findings, leading some to wonder if the panel determined the players had, in fact, raped an unconscious female student. According to the Tennessean, the school's report concluded only that Vandenburg was an 'accomplice' in violating the woman's privacy. Scroll down for video . Guilty: A jury found Brandon Vandenburg, pictured left on Tuesday, and Cory Batey, pictured right on Monday, guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery. A year before, Vanderbilt's internal review came to a different conclusion . Video footage taken during the June 2013 incident shows football players carrying an unconscious woman down a hallway and laughing as they photograph her and remove articles of her clothing. The school is now the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights for its handling of sexual violence allegations. While that investigation is ongoing, Vandenburg and Baty--both 21--face a possible decades-long jail sentence after they were found guilty last week of multiple counts of sexual assault. The two remaining defendants alleged to have joined Batey and Vandenburg in the dorm room attack, former players Jaborian McKenzie and Brandon Banks, probably helped themselves by cooperating with authorities, but their consequences loom much larger now that their former teammates have been found guilty. University officials, experts on sex crimes and survivors of sexual assault at Vanderbilt and all over the country hope the verdict's loudest signal goes out to women suffering in silence - telling them that justice is possible without destroying their own lives in the process. Most college sex assaults don't turn out this way. A recent Justice Department study found that 80 percent of campus rapes went unreported between 1995 and 2013, compared to 67 percent in the general population. An attorney for one of the ex-Vanderbilt University football players convicted of raping an unconscious fellow student says he will ask that a mistrial be declared after learning that a jury member was a rape victim. Fletcher Long says the juror was asked during jury selection about past experience with the criminal justice system, as either a victim or defendant. Long says the juror failed to disclose the rape. Long said the person 'lied to get on the jury' and 'got on with an agenda.' The juror's attorney, Sunny Eaton, said her client did not make misrepresentations. Eaton said the juror's past had 'no impact whatsoever' on decision-making at trial. The Associated Press does not generally identify sexual-assault victims. A spokeswoman for prosecutors said they do not believe the issue will overturn the verdict. Attorney: Vandenburg's lawyer Fletcher Long says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection . Easy decision: Jurors (from left), Dr Deirdre Young, Todd Easter and Dr. Corbi Milligan said they knew they had to convict Vandenburg and Batey when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack . The victim said she hopes her experience will encourage others to discuss how to end campus rapes. 'I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone,' she said in a statement read by one of the prosecutors. 'You are not to blame.' In this case, the evidence was overwhelming. Jurors saw university surveillance video and the players' own graphic cellphone images that put them at the scene. Vandenburg could be heard laughing and encouraging the attack on video he shared while it was happening. Testimony showed that he passed out condoms during the June 23, 2013 attack. Charging all four players with rape even though not all of them engaged in the act itself sends a strong message about holding people accountable, said Jane Stapleton, a University of New Hampshire professor who runs bystander intervention programs at campuses. Only two players were accused of raping the student, but all four were charged with it because prosecutors held them criminally responsible based on their actions that night. Vandenburg gets a hug from attorney Albert Perez Jr. after being found guilty. The 21-year-old was called an 'accomplice' in violating the rape victim's privacy in an internal investigation from jsut after the June 2013 incident . 'The jury has spoken. Now it is up to the court to impose an appropriate sentence on the defendants. The conduct revealed by the evidence at trial was profoundly disturbing and utterly unacceptable. 'Our heart goes out to the victim. Her testimony was forceful and brave. She has received our care and support. 'Many months ago Vanderbilt found both defendants responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy, and we quickly discharged both of them from the football team and subsequently expelled them from the university. We are confident we acted appropriately. 'Since Vanderbilt first reported the incident to the Nashville police, we have given our full cooperation to law enforcement, including the District Attorney's office. We will continue to do so. 'The safety and security of our students is Vanderbilt's top priority. Sexual violence will never be tolerated. Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.' The trial provided a rare opportunity to see what rape really looks like, experts on sexual violence said. 'There's no shortage of rape and sexual assault cases being put out in the media, but very rarely do we hear all the graphic details of a sexual assault,' said Rachel Freeman, vice president of programs at the Sexual Abuse Center of Nashville. And unlike so many other rape cases, this wasn't a matter of 'he-said/she-said.' The video made it obvious the woman was unconscious and totally incapable of consenting, so it was impossible to suggest that she was somehow to blame, Freeman said. The woman testified that the last thing she remembered was Vandenburg giving her drinks at a Nashville nightspot - and that she woke up the next morning in his dorm room, feeling sick and injured. To this day, she has no memory of the attack, she told jurors. Rumors swirled around campus, but she didn't learn what had happened until well after police came to her. The players had tried to cover it up by erasing the images. Testimony showed at least five other Vanderbilt athletes saw her in distress and did not report it. Only when Vanderbilt officials stumbled across closed-circuit TV showing players carrying an unconscious woman through the dormitory and into the room did they begin asking questions and summon the police, who recovered the digital evidence that made all the difference in court. Seeing the case through wasn't easy. The woman cried quietly throughout the trial, and doubled over and appeared to vomit at one point when Batey was testifying. But The Associated Press and other news organizations preserved her privacy, and she endured the proceedings as a Vanderbilt graduate. The attack didn't keep her from finishing her degree, and she's now pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience at an out-of-state university. That a victim of gang rape managed to keep her academic career on track is a real achievement, advocates say, something Vanderbilt officials hope students everywhere will consider. Beth Fortune, Vanderbilt's vice chancellor of academic affairs, called the victim's response 'forceful and brave,' and said sexual violence will never be tolerated at the school. 'Incidents will be investigated, victims will be supported, and perpetrators will be punished. We will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every Vanderbilt student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress.' 'Attackers': Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused in the rape case. All four men were expelled from Vanderbilt but never accused of rape by the university . 'Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process. I'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes. The hard work of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors and victims' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible. 'I want to especially thank detective Jason Mayo, Sgt. Mike Shreeve, Detective Chad Gish, Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman, Assistant District Attorneys Jan Norman and Roger Moore and victims' advocates Wanda Swan, Lt. Rochelle Barrios and Teresa Shearon. You are my heroes and I am so proud of and grateful for each of you. 'I am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses. Finally, I want to remind other victims of sexual violence: You are not alone. You are not to blame.'",

Changes in her protein and hormone levels have been detected and her nesting behaviour has also changed. Scroll down for LIVE feed from the enclosure . New arrival? Keepers believe that Tian Tian may be pregnant after she was artificially inseminated in April . Tenterhooks: Hopeful keepers at the zoo have observed Tian Tian's lack of appetite, moodiness, and 'nesting behaviour' Who's the daddy? Only blood tests on the cub would determine whether Yuang Guan, left, or Bao Bao, right, is the father . Edinburgh Zoo said the signs were encouraging – but warned there is still a chance it could be a phantom pregnancy. Ian Valentine, director of the zoo’s panda project, said: ‘It is possible Tian Tian could give birth in just two weeks. ‘The window we are looking at starts on August 24 but it looks like it may be towards the end of the month or later.’ The zoo artificially inseminated ten-year-old Tian Tian after she was reluctant to mate with her male companion Yang Guang. Something to celebrate? The team at the zoo artificially inseminated Tian Tian, or Sweetie, after she was reluctant to mate with her male companion Yang Guang, or Sunshine . Precious: Tian Tian, seen rolling backwards in her enclosure at the zoo today, and male Yang Guang are the UK's only pair of giant pandas . 'Moody': The team at the zoo have not been able to carry out an ultrasound, but if their suspicions prove correct Tian Tian could give birth to a cub as soon as next month . Keeping us guessing: Tian Tian and Yang Guang arrived from China in December 2011 . New Mum: Tian Tian's hormones have changed, suggesting she is pregnant or in a stage of pseudo-pregnancy . Motherly? Tian Tian relaxes today after it was announced that she may be pregnant . The pair arrived in Scotland in 2011 on a ten-year loan from China. There was no way to be certain Tian Tian is pregnant because she has resisted an ultrasound scan. She has been showing a lack of appetite and restlessness, and has made a bed of straw in apparent nesting behaviour but pandas are prone to pseudo pregnancies. Mr Valentine said: ‘Confirming a female panda’s pregnancy is never straightforward and we would encourage people to try not to get too excited just yet. 'Indications are good': Keepers in Edinburgh described signs Tian Tian could be pregnant as 'hugely exciting' ‘The overall picture is looking quite good. We have to assume she will give birth not just to one but to twins. Quite often pandas  in captivity give birth to twins,  and she gave birth to twins the last time.’ If the pregnancy is confirmed, an expert from China will fly over before the birth. Sperm from a giant panda in Berlin, Bao Bao, was used in the attempt to inseminate Tian Tian. However, only a blood test on the cub will determine whether he or Yang Guang is the father. The cub, or cubs, would officially be the property of China and be sent there after two years. The panda pair have been a popular attraction, with visits from around 500,000 people in their first year . Ready to mate: Yang Guang relaxes in as he prepares to mate with Tian Tian in the window of opportunity . Tian Tian enjoys the pool in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo as she . approaches her annual window of opportunity when her hormones are high . Male Yang Guang (pictured) and Tian Tian are kept separate  as pandas can be territorial . Tian Tian and Yang Guang will stay in Edinburgh for a decade. Any child will be sent to China after two years . Giant pandas are native to the mountain forests of Chinese provinces Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. Estimates suggest only between 1,000 and 2,000 giant pandas remain in the wild. Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first to live in the UK for 17 years. They are staying at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. The zoo grows about 15% of the bamboo needed to feed the giant pandas. The rest is imported from Amsterdam. Yang Guang goes through 55kg of bamboo a day and Tian Tian around 30kg. Female pandas ovulate once a year, giving a window of just 36 hours in which they can get pregnant. Normal breeding season for pandas is from mid-April to May. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April using semen from Yang Guang and frozen semen from Bao Bao, a 'genetically important' panda which died in Berlin Zoo last year. Gestation period is typically five months and the panda will give birth to one or two cubs. Panda cubs are born blind, hairless and unable to move, making them dependent on their mother for survival. After six to eight weeks, cubs open their eyes for the first time. They feed on their mother's milk for the first year and start eating bamboo at around six months. Big eater: Panda Yang Guang needs 44lb of bamboo shoots every day . August 24 2003: Tian Tian born and reared at Ya'an reserve in Chengdu, China. Yang Guang born 10 days earlier. 2011 .

        "document": "By . Katie Davies . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 11 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:51 EST, 11 February 2013 . A teenage sports fan has been left recovering from a paralyzing major stroke which doctors mistakenly diagnosed as a migraine. James Finnerty, 15, from Parma Heights, Ohio, who plays both rugby and football, woke up suffering with a severe headache last April and immediately began vomiting. His parents became particularly concerned when the teen appeared confused and couldn't comprehend a note left on the kitchen counter so rushed him to the emergency room. Long road to recovery: Sports fan, James Finnerty, pictured in a football t-shirt, is recovering from a stroke which doctors misdiagnosed as a migraine . Once there doctors misdiagnosed him with a migraine before his mother, who's a nurse, insisted on a second opinion. A CT scan discovered he was actually suffering from a pediatric stroke and was close to death. James and his family have now spoken of his miraculous road to recovery with the teenager now back in school although permanently barred from the sports field where they believe his injuries may have begun. 'She kept yelling at the doctors,' said James, recalling his mother's reaction in the emergency room. 'I remember 95 percent of it. My left side was gone and I couldn't move at all,' he told ABC News. James was held in his local hospital for 25 hours before his mother insisted he be transferred to her workplace - the Cleveland Clinic. She disagreed with the diagnosis of a migraine and it turns out she was right - her son had a torn artery and had swelling in his brain as a result of a stroke. Doctors now believe the injury was the . result of a hit in a rugby game which came four days before and caused a . clot. Friendship: James Finnerty, pictured center, is particularly grateful to his friends who have supported him in his recovery from a life-threatening stroke . He was operated on twice at the clinic and left with a titanium plate in the back of his head. He suffered a second stroke during his treatment and lost the use of speech and movement. In the weeks that followed he was unable to communicate with his family and was so confused he referred to his 14-year-old brother as 'Mailbox' Yet despite the seriousness of his injuries after a year of physiotherapy, the determined young man is well on the road to recovery . 'He can go through this and have a smile on his face like it's no big deal and laugh about his weaknesses,' said his mother Stefania Finnerty, 42. 'He's always been go-lucky and always so dedicated to his fitness that he wanted to do the best he could…He just works so hard.' Life-saving: James Finnerty was taken to the Cleveland Clinic, pictured, after his mother demanded a second opinion. They discovered he was suffering a stroke rather than a migraine as first diagnosed . 'Even with me being a neuro-nurse, I didn't think this could happen. I do feel that any child in sports who has possibly hit his head or neck or chest and they are feeling different should get scanned.' Mrs Finnerty was recovering from breast cancer at the time of the accident but sat at her son's bedside for two months alongside her husband, Thomas, who is a police dispatcher and runs his own gardening business. 'I would go through cancer and chemo a hundred times over than to deal with this. To have your child [sick] -- there are no descriptions. So I had to put myself on a back burner because I was so focused on my child,' she said. James now suffers some balance problems and is permanently barred from the sports field. He is also at risk of having another stroke in the future. According to the Cleveland Clinic around 3,000 children a year suffer a stroke with many left with long-term disability as a result. Stroke often occurs as a result of injury on the sports field. 'It's a common story,' Dr. Neil Friedman, James' doctor, told the broadcaster. 'There was initial damage to the artery, and he did weightlifting and extended the tear and stroked his cerebellum. It wasn't for another 25 hours that he had progressive worsening of the headache that we realized he had a stroke.… The brain was basically being pushed down through an opening in the skull.' James is particularly grateful to his school friends who visited him at hospital and set up a Facebook group called Prayers for James Finnerty. 'My son has the best friends ever, Jamie and my family and I are truly blessed,' Thomas Finnerty wrote on Facebook . 'They were terrific,' James, now 16, told ABC. 'They were there every day and have seen the worst of the worst. Cleaning my room had to be disgusting. I felt bad about that.' However the high school student refuses to be defined by his injury. 'I don’t like to use the word ‘stroke’ anymore. I just say that I got my head messed up,' he told www.cleveland.com.",

        "document": "Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) -- When the topic of HIV/AIDS enters a conversation, Earl Thompson hears that it's \"just what gays get.\" \"It's not a gay disease,\" said Thompson. \"It's a human disease.\" When a person gets a disease like cancer, support pours in, said Thompson, a slender 27-year-old with a boyish face. Family and friends fund raise and make sure their loved one gets proper care. But that's not the case with HIV. \"It's like hush-hush,\" said Thompson, a Jacksonville native, who learned before his birthday in April that he has HIV. \"You feel unlovable. You feel tainted. They're going to point a finger at me and be judging me. \"Just from the community, I know they don't talk about it. Jacksonville has many years before we're close to Miami, Orlando or Tampa. If something goes wrong, you don't talk about it.\" It's a problem all across the Bible Belt. The Southeast is disproportionately struck with higher HIV/AIDS rates than much of the rest of the country. Dealing with the epidemic in the South \"is extremely challenging, because the stigma and discrimination is worse,\" said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"There is less discourse around prevention, sexual health, comprehensive sex education in schools or having strong, community-based advocacy activities.\" Pastor fights HIV stigma in rural town . Jacksonville has the fifth-highest number of AIDS diagnoses among U.S. cities, according to CDC statistics from 2008. The state says this could have been a statistical aberration because surveillance methods and HIV/AIDS reporting laws changed in Florida in 2007, causing fluctuations in the data. But local HIV advocates in northeast Florida say the problem is a real one, not just a statistical blip. \"Here in Jacksonville, we're kind of the buckle in the Bible belt,\" said Donna Fuchs, executive director of Northeast Florida AIDS Network. \"HIV carries a huge stigma in our city.\" Fuchs said the organization had trouble finding office space in 2000. One property owner refused to rent to the group, saying he didn't want people with AIDS in his buildings. Today, the office sits on a quiet, tree-lined street with a simple sign that reads: NFAN. A red ribbon, the ubiquitous sign for HIV/AIDS, usually adorns the logo for the organization. But not here. \"Clients didn't want a red ribbon on the door,\" said Fuchs. \"We had to take it down.\" Four blocks away, there is another HIV organization -- one named for NBA star Magic Johnson, who revealed in 1991 that he is HIV-positive. When that clinic opened a decade ago, the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held inside the lobby. Organizers moved the event indoors because people feared being seen and associated with the disease. Today, that one-story clinic tucked behind a towering magnolia tree no longer bears Johnson's name. \"The only way we can get people to come through the front door is to create a fictitious name.\" said Todd Reese, associate director of Health Care Center operations at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. \"No one walks into any building or floor that has any association with HIV.\" Although visible HIV signs may be scrubbed from public view, the epidemic has worsened. HIV cases in Duval County, which mostly consists of Jacksonville, increased by 33% in the first half of 2011. This year, the county Health Department reports an increase in new cases. \"It's really not acceptable,\" said Dr. Bob Harmon, the county's Health Department director. \"This disease is ruining lives, and it's still killing people, especially low-income people who don't get tested enough and who don't get treated early.\" Several HIV/AIDS advocates in Jacksonville criticized sex education in schools that emphasized abstinence. The mentality is that HIV/AIDS is not an issue here, several advocates said. \"Denial is the biggest problem,\" said Reese. And those who reveal their HIV status struggle to find acceptance. Thompson observed that some people who knew about his HIV status avoided physical contact with him. In social settings, they watched their drinks to make sure their glasses didn't get mixed up. \"Sometimes you feel like a pin cushion, like you're never going to find acceptance,\" Thompson said. \"You feel like you're going to be looked at as a disease, not as a person.\" What perpetuates the epidemic is a social issue, Reese said. In Florida, the HIV/AIDS focus has historically been placed in southern part of the state. Some of the earliest HIV cases were found in Miami and in the Haitian immigrant population in South Florida. Miami still struggles with new HIV/AIDS cases; often, it has the highest AIDS rates in the country. \"You can go to Miami and you can put up a billboard, you can talk about condoms, AIDS and sex,\" Reese said. \"You can't do that in Jacksonville. People will be offended. They don't want to talk about it or see it. They don't want to see billboards about it.\" And Jacksonville is no small town: It has about 821,000 residents. iReporters share their stories on World AIDS Day . It's a different population, said Harmon. \"In north Florida, our population profile is more like Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi than it is central and south Florida. That generally means higher rates of poverty, lower rates of completing high school and college, and higher percentage of African-American population.\" Duval County has a high percentage of African-Americans, and in Jacksonville, 71% of the total HIV cases are African-Americans. Wade Price, 46, is a black gay man, proud father of three and grandfather of three. He keeps a half-dozen orange prescription bottles of anti-HIV medications on his nightstand next to his red leather-bound Bible. The pages of his well-worn Bible are patchworks of green and orange highlights. He reads scriptures every night and attends a Baptist church twice a week. Because his faith is crucial, Price decided to tell the head minister of his church how he struggled with being gay. He wanted to have prayer meetings with ministers and start a church support group. Price told the minister: \"I'm not the only one. Lots of people are keeping quiet, living double lives.\" The minister rebuffed him, saying, \"Wow, it's times like this, I don't like being a minister.\" \"That's one aspect of black churches,\" Price said. \"They want to turn blind eyes to it. ... I'm fighting this battle on my own.\" Price left that church and found another one last month that is more accepting. \"We pretend it's not happening,\" Price said. \"The virus is being spread. You want to pretend like sex isn't happening. They say, 'Condoms, oh, no! That's not for God!' What's not for God is living with ignorance.\" The social climate in northern Florida tends to be more conservative, said Harmon. \"There may be a reluctance to talk about this in the family, in the church, in other social settings and to perhaps ignore it,\" he said. But there are signs of change. Churches in the community have started to talk about the HIV/AIDS epidemic, said Veronica Hicks, 50. Hicks has never felt the need to hide her AIDS diagnosis and told her fellow church members and her pastor. \"They embrace me with it,\" she said. And Hicks's church has already started an HIV/AIDS testing and awareness ministry in Jacksonville. While stigma persists in the community, it's getting better, she said. She reported seeing growing HIV support groups, increasing turnout at community HIV/AIDS events and a recent line of people waiting to get tested at a mobile clinic. \"It shows me that people are willing to become more educated because HIV is prevalent and relevant.\"",

A 66-year-old woman was crushed to death by a homemade elevator as she tried to visit her disabled friend. Margaret Harrison's body was found trapped under the device by her long-term partner Frank Jorr, who had gone to search for her after she failed to show up at Jean Blair's home on Tuesday morning. Mrs Blair's husband, Robert, had built the elevator out of an old forklift truck 17 years ago to make it easier for his wife, who uses a motorized scooter, to get around their Weeki Wachee, Florida home. Frank Jorr, 64, holds a photograph of his girlfriend Margaret Harrison, 66, who died after she was crushed by a homemade elevator while visiting her friend . Homemade: The elevator can be seen to the right of the Florida home of Jean and Robert Blair . Ordinarily he would be the one to operate the elevator, which has since been condemned, but he was having an operation on Tuesday morning, according to 10 News. His wife, who had arranged for Mrs Harrison to keep her company while her husband and son were at the hospital, had sent the elevator to the ground floor, not realizing her friend was in its path. Mrs Blair, now 81, is mostly stationary due to heart problems and failing limbs and relies on a power wheelchair. She called Mrs Harrison her 'very best friend.' 'My heart is just broken,' she said. Those who knew her Mrs Harrison said she was a kind, generous woman who put others before herself. The lift had been on the side of the three-storey home for 17 years and when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it' said Mr Blair . Mrs Harrison's body was discovered by Mr Jorr who Mrs Blair had called after she became concerned when her friend had not arrived. After finding Mrs Harrison's car in the driveway he headed towards the elevator, where he could see something poking out from under it. He activated the elevator to raise it, which is when he discovered his partner trapped underneath. 'I knew as soon as I saw her,' Mr Jorr told the Tampa Bay Times. 'She was blue already.' Mrs Harrison, a widow and mother of two grown children, had met him in 2002. Mrs Blair had offered to meet her friend on the ground floor so they could ride up in it together, but Mrs Harrison had told her she knew how the elevator worked and would make her own way to the second floor. Mr Blair has suggested that perhaps Mrs Harrison had a seizure, which is why she was unable to get out of the way. Accidental death: Margaret Harrison was crushed by the device, at the end of the house, when she came to visit . Condemned: The elevator, built by Robert Blair for his wife 17 years ago, has been shut down by officials . He built the lift on the side of his three-storey home 17 years ago, and said when police examined it 'they couldn't find anything wrong with it'. The elevator, made from a forklift, steel and wood, has since been condemned by the Building Department, which said it was illegal because it had been built without permits, and was also unsafe. Under Florida law, lifts and other conveyances in private homes do not require certificates of operation or inspections. There . was no electrical permit issued, as required, for the Blairs' device, . said county Building Department operations manager Jodi Singer. The elevator also lacked the required safety switches, county building official Frank Curlee said. Officials shut down the device, but no citations were issued. The couple told police that the elevator, which could work even in a power cut, was serviced every month, according to ABC Action News. Mrs Harrison's death has been ruled as accidental after a post-mortem examination.",

        "document": "New York (CNN) -- The New York City Board of Health unanimously approved a mandate Wednesday requiring all children under 5 enrolled in city-licensed preschools and day cares to receive the flu vaccine. It is one of outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg's final health initiatives, which the New York City Department of Health proposed to the Board of Health in September. \"Young children have a high risk of developing severe complications from influenza,\" the Health Department said in a statement. \"One-third of children under five in New York City do not receive an annual influenza vaccination, even though the vaccine safely and effectively protects them against influenza illness. Young children often pass influenza to other children and family members, who then spread the infection to others in the community.\" The flu vaccine will be added to the seven other vaccines children under 5 are required to get, including measles, whooping cough and chicken pox. \"We know that influenza is a serious illness which affects an estimated 15% to 40% of children during annual flu season,\" said Dr. Jay Varma, who oversees infectious diseases as deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department. Richard Kanowitz, president of Families Fighting Flu, lost his daughter at age 4 to the virus. \"This is great news for children,\" he said. \"Had the same law been in effect when my daughter was alive in 2004, she'd be alive today. She would not have gotten the flu.\" \"Only 60 percent of children under the age of 5 in New York City get vaccinated,\" Dr. Varma said. \"In New Jersey and Connecticut, where they have this requirement, it's 80%.\" The issue of vaccinating children is controversial. One consistent claim is that vaccines can cause autism. \"This was a very closed process,\" said John Gilmore, director of the Manhattan-based Autism Action Network. \"We will most likely be filing a lawsuit fairly soon to overturn this. From a legal standpoint, we see this as similar to the soda ban,\" referring to the mayor's unsuccessful attempt to ban sugary drinks. Varma said the myths that flu shots can cause the flu, or worse, are just that, myths. \"It does not cause you to get the flu; it does not cause you to get autism,\" he said. The flu vaccine is available in two forms -- shot or nasal spray -- and children are required to get vaccinated by December 31. \"To the extent that this saves lives, it's great news,\" Kranowitz said. \"I wish my daughter had had the vaccination because, I, as well as other parents, were unaware how the flu killed healthy children. So the only way to protect them is to get them vaccinated.\"",

A family whose Christmas decorations have raised thousands of pounds for charity have been ordered to pull them down this year for safety reasons. For the last eight years, John and Teresa Baggott have transformed their front garden into a dazzling Santa's grotto with thousands of fairly lights, illuminated snowmen and a mechanical Father Christmas. But housing bosses say the way they have altered their electrics at their home in Paignton, Devon, is a safety hazard. 'We put our heart and soul into it': John Baggott, pictured with his disabled son Shea in front of their Christmas display last year, has been told he can't have the decorations up this year for safety reasons . Dazzling: For the last eight years, John and Teresa Baggott have transformed their front garden into a Santa's grotto with thousands of fairly lights, illuminated snowmen and a mechanical Father Christmas . Sanctuary Housing have reportedly also ordered the couple to tear down a shed they built to store their decorations. Mr Baggott says the family are so upset they want to move to a new home with their three boys - Zach, 18, Kai, 16, and disabled son Shea, 14, who suffers from a muscle and nerve-wasting condition. The security guard, 47, said: 'We did it (the decorations) for the kids. They would come round and go: \"wow!\" 'But a representative from Sanctuary Housing came round and told me I had to take down all the hooks and the electric boxes on the wall because he didn't want electrics outside the house. 'So if I wanted to put lights up, I couldn't. 'Sanctuary also told me to rip down my shed, which I built when I moved in eight years ago, so we didn't have anywhere to store all the decorations and had to sell them.' 'Serious concerns about the safety of these works': Housing bosses say the way they have altered their electrics to power the display at their home in Paignton, Devon, is a hazard . Mr Baggott said the family's Christmas decorations have raised more than £8,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and a nearby school for children with learning difficulties. The annual display, which takes around two weeks to assemble, last year earned them first place in the the residential category of the Torbay Winter Glitterland competition. Mr Baggott said they are now trying to find a new home to escape Sanctuary's 'Scrooge-like' rules. He added: 'We put a lot of work into it. We put our heart and soul into it and it looked pretty good. 'Shea loved the lights. He would sit out there for hours in his wheelchair looking at them. He's upset and he has picked up that we're stressed. 'I've got pride in my home and I want to be able to decorate it how I want. Hopefully, our new landlord will let us put lights up and we'll build the collection up again.' A spokesman for Sanctuary Group confirmed the family were told they were 'not allowed to tamper with the electrics of the property'. She said: 'As standard with rented accommodation, tenants should not tamper with the electrics, build onto or extend the property without their landlord's consent, and Sanctuary has only very recently been made aware of the extent of work done to the home. 'The family has significantly altered and extended the electrics at the property and we have serious concerns about the safety of these works.'",

        "document": "By . John Hall . David Beckham and other members of Manchester United's famous 'Class of '92' squad are poised to front a £2billion takeover of the club, it has been claimed. The takeover is believed to be funded by the oil-rich Qatari royal family and brokered by Beckham - who spent several months playing for Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain before retiring last season. Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt are said to be in detailed talks to become the frontmen of a multi-billion consortium hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from Americans Joel and Avram Glazer, who purchased Manchester United in 2005. The claims, made in The Sun today, have not been confirmed by the former players and a spokesman for the club said it had not received any bids. Scroll down for video . Stars: (From left): Manchester United legends Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. The players are said to be in detailed talks to front a multi-billion pound takeover of the club . Shares in Manchester United rose by $16.14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday amid speculation over the prospective takeover bid. The club is currently valued at $2.6 billion, equal to £1.6 billion, despite having one of their worst seasons in living memory - including losing 3-0 to local rivals Manchester City on Tuesday. The club's underachievement this season has seen players past and present complain publicly about the way the club is performing. Following the defeat to Manchester City, striker Wayne Rooney admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to Old Trafford anymore because United are simply not good enough. Rooney was left to reflect on another poor performance after admitting the team had lost their Old Trafford 'fear factor'. Owners: The 'Class of '92' stars are said to be hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from Americans Joel and Avram Glazer (pictured), who purchased Manchester United in 2005 . Shares in Manchester United rose by $16.14 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday amid speculation over a prospective takeover bid by the 'Class of '92' stars . The players involved in the alleged takeover bid were all members of Manchester United's 1992 youth team. They include Gary Neville (back row, second from left), Nicky Butt (back row, second from right), David Beckham (bottom row, second from left) and Paul Scholes (bottom row, second from right) Legends: Ryan Giggs (left) and Phil Neville (right) are another two Manchester United stars linked to the bid. Both were considered members of the club's famous 'Class of '92' Many Manchester United fans have been unhappy with the ownership of the Glazer family since they purchased a controlling stake in the club for £810million in 2005. The initial protests came as a result of the takeover itself, as the Glazers performed a highly leveraged buyout - effectively dumping £525million debt on the club overnight. Manchester United's board had earlier branded the Glazer family's plans 'aggressive'. Debt: The Glazer family (Avram left and Joel right) performed a highly leveraged takeover of Manchester United - effectively dumping £525million debt on the club overnight . Although they paid £270million from their own funds, the rest of the money used to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans - the majority of which were secured against the club's assets -  which have since incurred interest payments of more than £60million a year. In the four years up to June 2009, when Manchester United last published their accounts - the club became liable to pay more than £325million in interest alone, not including interest not paid. This increased the debt the Glazers loaded on to the club to about £700million. Many supporters felt the Glazer family - who also own the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers - had taken a great risk in their financial dealings. Fans accused them of using Manchester United purely for financial gain and to remove debt from their US-business interests, adding that they had failed to understand the significance of owning one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the world. The Glazers have always denied this to be the case. Unpopular: Supporter groups have taken to wearing green and gold in protest at Glazer ownership. The colours were originally worn by Newton Heath FC, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902 . As a result of the anger, from 2009 supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold - the colours of Newton Heath FC - which was the original name for Manchester United. The protest was seen as a way to remind the Glazers of the long history of the club and to remind them there was more at stake than money. Green and gold scarves and hats have become a symbol of resistance against the Glazers ever since, and remain a common sight at the club's 76,000-seater stadium Old Trafford. Troubled: The tactics used by David Moyes (pictured) have led to fan and even player unrest at United . Just over a week after describing . their 3-0 defeat by arch-rivals Liverpool as one of the worst days he . had ever had in football, the England international found himself trying . to explain a similar scoreline at home to neighbours City. The poor performance has led to rumours the club's owners may be happy to walk away. 'The Glazers have lost interest. Everyone knows the club is effectively up for sale,' a source told The Sun. Middle Eastern bidders have reportedly approached the Glazers several times about a prospective takeover, with the only sticking point on each occasion being the price, the newspaper reported. In 2010 the club were subject to a takeover bid . from a local group dubbed the Red Knights, but they also failed because they couldn't meet the Glazers' asking price. Earlier this week Paul Scholes gave credence to rumours of discontent at the club when he gave a scathing review of current manager David Moyes during an appearance on Sky Sports. Despite saying the club needs to stick by Moyes, Scholes was highly critical of the current crop of players and the tactics being deployed in the post Sir Alex Ferguson-era. Lost interest? There is speculation the Glazer family (Avram pictured centre) are ready to sell the club . Decline: Following the defeat to Manchester City, striker Wayne Rooney admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to Old Trafford (pictured) anymore because United are simply not good enough . Protect: Stewards were seen guarding a banner declaring David Moyes 'The Chosen One' from angry fans after United's defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday . Despite rumours that the 'Class of '92' players may be involved . in the purchase of Manchester United, Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs are . also said to be close to purchasing Salford City FC. In a move that may see the club renamed Salford 92 and Paul Scholes appointed manager, the club are believed to be aiming for Championship-level football within 15 years. A . spokesperson for Manchester United said: 'We haven't received any bids . for the club. If we had we would have informed the New York Stock . Exchange.' Ryan Giggs, 40 . Giggs was the first of the so-called Class of '92 to break into the Manchester United first team, and is the only member still playing professional football. Now a player/coach under David Moyes at United - the club at which he has spent his entire career - Giggs signed a reported £80,000-a-week contract last year that will expire this summer. With an estimated total wealth of £34million, Giggs is the co-owner of GG Hospitality - a hotel and restaurant management company which he set up with Gary Neville. Gary Neville, 39 . Neville retired from football in 2011 after making 400 appearances for Manchester United. He joined Sky Sports at the start of the 2011–12 season, taking over as match analyst on Monday Night Football from Andy Gray to much acclaim. A year after taking the job, Neville was appointed assistant manger to Roy Hodgson with the England national team. Worth about £20million, Neville is understood to have a growing property portfolio alongside his business interests, which includes the aforementioned GG Hospitality business he set up with Ryan Giggs. Phil Neville, 37 . Gary Neville's younger brother Phil retired as captain of Everton at the end of last season. Despite speculation he may join his brother in the coaching setup, Phil was appointed as Manchester United First Team Coach under David Moyes in time for the start of this season. Phil Neville has raised over £20million for the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where his daughter has been treated for her cerebral palsy. Nicky Butt, 39 . Although a dynamic defensive midfield player, Nicky Butt's post-playing career has been reasonably unremarkable. Finishing his playing days in Hong Kong with South China FC, Butt took a year-long break before becoming a reserve team coach at Manchester United. Nicky Butt is estimated to be worth around £14million. Paul Scholes, 39 . A true legend of the Manchester United midfield, Paul Scholes first retired in 2011 before returning a year later to help Sir Alex Ferguson to lift the Premier League title. Retiring alongside the only manager he ever played under, 'shy' Scholes has made limited television and radio appearances as a pundit and is understood to be keen to get into coaching and eventually management. If the Salford FC takeover goes ahead, Scholes is rumoured to become the team's manager. David Beckham, 38 . Without doubt the most high profile of the Class of '92, Beckham played for many of the world's biggest clubs - including AC Milan and Real Madrid - before finishing his playing career at Paris Saint-Germain. Worth £165million - much of which has been accrued through endorsements - Beckham has been among the top earners at every club he has played for. David Beckham's wife Victoria is a successful pop star and clothing designer in her own right, with the fashion company they co-own - Beckham Ventures Ltd - declaring a turnover of £15.4 million in 2012. Earlier this year Beckham announced that he was a prominent stakeholder in a proposed £15million Miami MLS franchise - which would ensure he will be a major figure in US soccer for many years to come.",

        "document": "A Champagne price war has been triggered with Tesco slashing the price of one award winning brand to just £8. Britain’s biggest grocer and drinks retailer has reduced its Louis Delaunay champagne by some 70per cent from the official list figure of £25.99. The champagne is now cheaper than many supposedly inferior sparkling wines such as Prosecco from Italy and Cava from Spain. Tesco has slashed the price of its Champagne, left, to just £8 while Asda's offering, right, is £10 . Lidl's Comte de Senneval Champagne, left, is £11.99 while Sainsbury's Henry Dumanois, right, is £12 . Historically, supermarkets have used bread, milk and baked beans as loss leaders to tempt shoppers through the doors, however Tesco has taken the challenge to the luxury end of the shopping list. The £8 price tag appears to be lowest price charged for a big brand champagne, produced according to the rules a heritage of the renowned wine region, for at least 10 years. It represents a serious challenge to the rest of the high street, particularly Aldi and Lidl, who are thriving on the back of an image of providing luxury products at affordable prices. Currently, the cheapest champagne from Aldi is its Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut  at £9.99, while Lidl offers the Comte de Senneval champagne at £11.99. On the face of it Tesco’s Louise Delaunay is a quality product. The drink, which comes from the town of Dizy, in the Champagne region of France, is described as having strong floral aromas and an elegant citrus flavour. This summer it won a bronze medal in blind taste tests at International Wine & Spirit Competition – an event considered the Oscars for the wine and champagne industry. It is produced from a combination of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay by the champagne maker Les Roches Blanches. The move by Tesco is timed to win vital Christmas shoppers, however it also taps into the fact that a growing number of people are regularly drinking champagne at home rather than just on special occasions. Industry figures show sales of sparkling wine rose by five per cent in terms of volume and 14.8per cent in value in the past year, as people traded up from cheap Cava to more expensive Prosecco and Champagne. Sales of sparkling wine were up by £70million to some £541million with more than 40per cent of people saying they had bought bubbly in the past year. Morrisons are charging £13.99 for their Gartissier, left and Aldi want £9.99 for the Monsigny, right . Kevan Mulcahey, head of alcohol at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘Shoppers are looking for something a bit special to treat themselves, and sparkling wine is a luxury product with an affordable price tag. ‘Shoppers are trading up from Cava to Prosecco and Prosecco to Champagne, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 14.8per cent compared with the same time last year. ‘Motivations for sparkling wine occasions have become more about ‘having a laugh’.’ Tesco champagne buyer Charlie Craven said: ‘This is a quality, award winning champagne and to find something this good for £8 on British high streets you’d have to go back at least 10 years. ‘We’re delighted that we can bring this to our customers at such a fantastic price.’ While the official list price is £25.99, Tesco has been selling it recently at half price of £12.99 and it is now going even further to undercut mainstream rivals such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Currently, Asda cheapest champagne is Pierre Darcys, which the company has cut from £24.25 to £10. Sainsbury’s Henry Dumanois Champagne Brut is down by £4 to £12, while Morrisons Champagne Gartissier Brut Nv is £13.99. A recent survey published by Which? chose Sainsbury’s Blanc de Blanc Brut Champagne at £22.50 a bottle as the best choice alongside Piper Heidsieck Brut Champagne at £33. The best Prosecco came from a Co-op own label at £9.99 with the judges praising its balance of bitterness and fruitiness. The price cut by Tesco appears to be a direct response to Asda cutting its Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to £10. Asda promoted its £10 deal by recreating a magazine front cover featuring reality TV star Kim Kardashian that went viral online when she vowed to ‘break the internet’. In the Asda mock-up a model balances a glass on her rear, while Champagne shoots over her head to fill it, as the tagline reads: ‘Don’t break the budget: Pierre Darcys’.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Approximately 44 million people live with dementia worldwide, according to the Alzheimer's Association. By 2050, that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million. In the fight against these fast-growing numbers, experts from all over the world discussed the latest research at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, this week. Here are five things we learned about Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia: . Hypertension in old age may save your brain . High blood pressure is usually called the \"silent killer.\" However, a new study from the University of California now suggests that if you're over 90, hypertension can save the life of your brain cells. Hypertension may protect against dementia in people over age 90, the study authors say. The researchers followed 625 participants who developed high blood pressure in their 90s for up to 10 years and found that their risk for dementia was 55% lower than people without a history of hypertension. Nevertheless, the study doesn't promote hypertension in the elderly, given that high blood pressure is related to other bad outcomes. \"I don't think it says if I find somebody who's doing well at age 90, whose blood pressure is 120/80, we should feed them salt to bump their blood pressure up,\" says William Klunk, vice chair of the Alzheimer's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council. The study simply shows that when it comes to normal levels of blood pressure, it might not be a one-size-fits-all with respect to age, he says. Better late than never . Seniors can lower their risk for late-life cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease with a number of lifestyle changes, new research suggests. A two-year clinical trial from Karolinska Institutet and the Finnish Institute for Health included 1,260 participants aged 60 to 77. One part of the group received a \"lifestyle-package,\" including nutritional guidance, physical exercise, management of heart health risk factors, cognitive training and social activities. The control group received standard health advice. After two years, the lifestyle-intervention group did much better in tests of memory and thinking. We know from past studies that implementing those lifestyle factors in midlife can hedge against Alzheimer's disease later on, says Ralph Nixon, chairman of the Alzheimer's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council. \"The good news from this particular study is that these kind of changes can be implemented in your 60s and 70s.\" Playing games makes your brain bigger . Middle-aged people who were avid game-players (think crosswords, checkers, cards) tended to have bigger brains than people who did not play games, according to a recent study that looked at brain scans. \"It's like looking at someone's muscle mass,\" said Dr. Laurel Coleman of the Maine Medical Center Geriatric Assessment Center. \"It's bad when it's smaller, good when it's bigger.\" Researchers looked specifically at certain parts of participants' brains. The volume among game-players was greater in areas that tend to be damaged by Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the potential for delaying -- maybe even avoiding -- the disease. People who kept their brains pumped scored higher on tests of their thinking ability. Coleman suggests mixing it up: Try potentially stimulating activities like learning a new language or switching from reading nonfiction to fiction -- anything that poses a cognitive challenge. Exercise benefits the mind too . Exercise seems to slow the descent toward dementia as well. Two sets of data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging suggest that exercise may positively influence how mild cognitive impairment (a precursor to dementia) and dementia develop. In one group of patients with mild cognitive impairment, exercising seemed to protect against developing dementia. Data on a different group of healthy patients who exercised -- either lightly or vigorously -- showed they were less likely to be diagnosed with cognitive impairment. \"We would never say that these things totally prevent Alzheimer's, that they will cure you,\" said Coleman, a geriatrician. \"But they're going to help your brain.\" A smell test may detect Alzheimer's . In the future, a test of your sense of smell may help doctors predict your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In two separate studies, scientists found that people who were unable to identify certain odors were more likely to experience cognitive impairment. The researchers believe that brain cells crucial to a person's sense of smell are killed in the early stages of dementia. Researchers say this information could help doctors create a smell test to detect Alzheimer's earlier. Early detection means early intervention and treatment to slow the progression of the disease. Doctors today can only diagnose Alzheimer's disease once it has caused significant brain damage. \"In the face of the growing worldwide Alzheimer's disease epidemic, there is a pressing need for simple, less invasive diagnostic tests that will identify the risk of Alzheimer's much earlier in the disease process,\" Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association, said in a statement. Blood test predicts Alzheimer's disease . 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . CNN's Jacque Wilson and Stephanie Smith contributed to this story.",

The company unveiled its latest self-driving vehicle on Monday, and it looks like a cartoon koala crossed with a smart car wearing a fez. Unlike the mock-up car Google first shared in May, this version is fully functional. It even has real headlights. The round, white and gray car is designed without permanent driving tools like a gas pedal or wheel. However, to comply with California state law, there are still removable, temporary controls for the required \"safety driver\" -- a real person who needs to be in the car and ready to take over in an emergency. The goal is to eventually remove any interior controls so that passengers can take a nap or knit while the car does all the work. Google's self-driving car team will continue to test the vehicle on a private track in California, where it works its way around traffic lights and mock construction zones. Google has said it's interested in launching a pilot program for the cars in the coming years. When the tech company first started experimenting with self-driving technology, it modified existing cars, like a Toyota, Audi and Lexus, by adding multiple cameras and sensors and an onboard computer. Now Google has moved on to making its own car from scratch. The car's dome-like shape is optimal for giving sensors the widest field of view. A car could help put people's minds at ease about the controversial technology. Before self-driving cars can start ferrying us to work, companies need figure out ethical issues (does it hit a deer or crash into the median?), improve basic driving functions, and work with governments on legislation to allow driverless cars on all roads. Google is just one of many companies developing driverless car technology. Universities and major auto manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes are working on similar vehicles.

        "document": "By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 14:57 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 5 June 2013 . When Trish Staine had back pains she put it down to her two-hour training session for a half-marathon, but when she went to the hospital for a check up she was told she was in labor. Five minutes after the 33-year-old from Duluth, Minnesota, was told she was pregnant, her daughter was born. The foster-mother, who already has two children with her husband, said she had always been skeptical about women claiming they didn't know they were pregnant - until it happened to her. Scroll down for video: . Trish Staine gave birth to her daughter just five minutes after she was told she was pregnant . Shock: Trish Staine with new daughter Mira, or Miracle, who made her unexpected arrival on Monday . Medical staff believe the baby, who was born at 3.25pm on Monday, arrived about five weeks early. Mrs Staine, who had been training for the Grandma's half-marathon on June 22, said she experienced no pregnancy symptoms and her husband, John, had also had a vasectomy. 'I didn't gain any weight. I . had my period. I had no idea,' she told WDIO. When she went into labor on Monday, she thought she had hurt her back while training on a hill in Glenwood. It wasn't until the pain became severe that she was taken by ambulance to St Mary's hospital. 'In the ER, they found a fetal . heartbeat. I was like, \"No no no. There's no way I'm pregnant\". But they . rushed me up to the birthing center, and five minutes after I got into . my room, she was born,' Mrs Staine said. New addition: Mira will have a host of older siblings to play when she comes home from hospital . Expanding family: Foster carer John Staine could not believe it when doctors said his wife had just had a baby . Her daughter, who has been named Mira, short for Miracle, weighed 6lb 6oz and, although her blood sugar was low, she was healthy. Mr Staine, a Navy veteran who has three sons from a previous relationship, first heard that he was a father again when he arrived at the hospital. When doctors told him he had a daughter, he said: 'Whose baby is that? It’s not possible,' Mr Staine told Duluth News Tribune. However, for every 1,000 vasectomies carried out in the U.S. 11 per cent will fail, resulting in unexpected pregnancies. The new father, who runs the Genesis Project with his wife, which helps young men aged 17 to 21 move from foster care to independent living, said Mrs Staine had been in a lot of pain on Monday. He recalled her crying in pain earlier in the day, but later she was 'screaming, crying and yelling out,' Mr Staine said. Because she had run for about nine miles the previous day, the couple thought she had trapped a nerve, or maybe had a kidney stone. She had taken pain relief, tried soaking her muscles in the bath but the pain became more intense. Finally Mr Staine, 47, who was at a medical center for a health check up, asked their children to get her to a hospital. When he arrived later Mr Staine said that he pinched the doctor who told him his wife had been in labor, adding: 'It was like a dream. I wanted to make sure it was real.' Happy and healthy: Trish Staine cuddles baby Mira, who was born after her mother trained for a half-marathon . He added that Mrs Staine had showed no signs of pregnancy, adding that his wife had even appeared to lose weight as she trained for the marathon. Fortunately, the couple have a large six-bedroom house to accommodate their children and foster children. They started the Genesis Project in 2010 because, as Mr Staine told Lake Voice News: 'If a kid is in trouble and needs a place to stay, something to eat, or a positive view of life, they can come to me.' When asked if his wife would still be running in the half-marathon later this month, he said: 'We paid for [the entry fee]. They’ve already cashed the check.'",

But could your Facebook status be giving more away about yourself than you realise? Researchers from Penn University studied the statuses of 75,000 people and were able to predict their age, gender and even personality type based just on the words they used. They also discovered that the sexes live up to stereotypes - with women posting regularly about their hair, boyfriends, chocolate, and babies, while for men it was all about computer games, beards,  swearing and sport. This cloud shows the most commonly used words by females on Facebook. Women were more likely to use adjectives, such as 'yummy' and 'wonderful', as well as more emoticons than men. They also regularly talked about their family and friends, clothes and hair . The . most commonly used words by women including 'shopping', 'excited', . 'love you' and the '<3' emoticon, which is used a heart. Men . commonly used the word 'f**k', 'f****g', 'wishes he', 'xbox' and . 'himself' and we more likely to link to content. Teenagers used emoticons, variations of the word 'haha' and discussed school, homework and teachers more than older people. They were also more likely to use abbreviations such as 'omfg' and 'gah'. At the older end of the scale - 30 and over - people talked more about napping, showering and wine as well work, wedding and laundry. A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured . words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up. Alternatively, a . word cloud for introverts featured references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'sigh' and more emoticons. To visualise the results, researchers created word clouds summarising the language that . predicted a certain trait, age or sex, with the size of the word relating directly to how often it was used. For example, the most commonly used words by women included 'shopping', 'excited', 'love you' and the '<3' emoticon, which is used a heart. While men commonly used the word 'f**k', 'f****g', 'wishes he', 'xbox' and 'himself', and were more likely to link to content. A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured . words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up. Alternatively, a . word cloud for introverts featured many references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'sigh' and more emoticons. Co-author Johannes Eichstaedt said: 'It may seem obvious that a super extroverted person . would talk a lot about parties, but taken all . together, these word clouds provide an unprecedented window into the . psychological world of people with a given trait. 'Many things seem . obvious after the fact and each item makes sense, but would you have . thought of them all, or even most of them?' Teenagers used emoticons, variations of the word 'haha' and discussed school, homework and teachers more than older people. They were also more likely to use abbreviations such as 'omfg' and 'gah', and discuss kissing, hugging and relationships . At the older end of the scale - 30 and over - people talked more about napping, showering and wine as well work, wedding and laundry, pictured . Facebook has added a feature that lets people edit their posts after they have been . published. The tool was previously only available on comments on posts. This means if someone types a mistake and wants to correct it they no longer have to leave it, or delete and re-post. To edit a status, click the arrow in the top right-hand corner of the post and click Edit. Type the changes and click Send again. Any posts that are changed will be tagged with 'Edited'. The . tool is being rolled out to the web version of the social network site, . but is expected to also be made available on Android and iOS apps in . the near future. Neurotics were more likely to use words such as 'scared', 'depressed' 'crap' and 'lonely', while people with less neuroticism used words including 'praise', 'blessed' 'beautiful', 'success' and spoke less about sports. 'This doesn't guarantee that doing . sports will make you less neurotic; it could be that neuroticism causes . people to avoid sports,' said co-author professor Lyle Ungar of Computer and Information Science. 'But it does suggest that we should . explore the possibility that neurotic individuals would become more . emotionally stable if they played more sports.' Open people spoke more about dreams, art, writing and the universe, whereas people who were less open on the personality questionnaire used more abbreviations and were poor spellers. The group from the University of Pennsylvania were interested in whether analysis of the language used on Facebook could provide as much, or more, insight into someone's personality compared to traditional methods used by psychologists, such as self-reported surveys and questionnaires. A word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured words and phrases including 'party,' 'great night' and 'hit me up', pictured . They asked 75,000 people to complete a common personality questionnaire through a Facebook app. The participants also made their Facebook status updates public for a limited time. From a database of more than 700 . million words, phrases and topics, the researchers looked for overall linguistic patterns used by the volunteers. They thencreated a computer algorithm that could predict the person's age and gender, as well their responses on the personality questionnaires. The . researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting users' gender based only on the language of their status updates, and they could identify a person's age within three years in more than 50 per cent of cases. The personality predictions were 'inherently less accurate' but author H. Andrew Schwartz, a postdoctoral fellow in computer and information science and the Positive Psychology Center, claimed that they were 'nearly as good as using a person's questionnaire results from . one day to predict their answers to the same questionnaire on another . day.' A word cloud for introverts featured many references to Japanese media, such as Pokeman and anime, 'google', 'sigh' and more emoticons than extroverts . 'Most . words occur rarely - any sample of writing, including Facebook status . updates, only contains a small portion of the average vocabulary,' Schwartz said. 'This means that, for all but the most common words, you . need writing samples from many people in order to make connections with . psychological traits. 'Traditional studies have found interesting . connections with pre-chosen categories of words such as 'positive . emotion' or 'function words.' However, the billions of word instances . available in social media allow us to find patterns at a much richer . level.' The study is part of the World Well-Being Project with members of the Computer and Information Science Department in Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Department of Psychology and its Positive Psychology Center in the School of Arts and Sciences.

        "document": "By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 06:16 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 8 November 2013 . This is what 1kg (2.2lb) of high-purity cocaine looks like, seized by police as the criminals that smuggled it into Britain are jailed for a total of 23 years. The highly-addictive stimulant was found in the kitchen of a house in Ludworth, County Durham, next to weighing scales and latex gloves as the criminals prepared to sell it. After being cut with other powders like baking soda, caffeine, or powdered milk to increase its weight, the group would have used the highly precise scales to divide the drugs into small plastic bags or paper wraps ready to be sold on the street. Illegal: 1kg of high-purity cocaine waiting to be cut using latex gloves and high sensitivity scales before being sold onto the streets in North East England . David Thompson, 28, from North Shields, was jailed alongside brothers Robert Hall, 40, and Thomas Hall, 35, after all three admitted conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs between January 2012 and May this year. Another 2.5kg (5.5lb) of cocaine was found at the same address, worth a total of £644,000, alongside 380 nine-ounce bars of cannabis resin, worth £402,000. In a 'stash house' police found a further 27kg (60lb) of cannabis with Thompson's finger prints on. The bars would either be sold whole or broken up into smaller lumps and sold as hashish, commonly known as hash. Hashish is made from the resin of the female cannabis plant which is extracted by grinding up the leaves before pressing them into a hard block. Users then heat the drug, causing it to break apart, before mixing it with tobacco and rolling it into a cigarette, or smoking it in a pipe. Alongside the cocaine police found 380 nine-ounce bars of cannabis resin worth around £402,000 . As with cocaine, unscrupulous dealers have been known to spray the plants with sand in order to increase their weight, and in 2008 around 30 people in Germany were poisoned after criminals mixed the class B drug with lead in order to make more profit. Cocaine is usually broken down into 1gram wraps which sell for around £50, but statistics from the UK Forensic Science Service have shown purity levels dropping to new lows, with a up to a third of cocaine seized containing less than 9 per cent of the substance. Heavy cannabis use is linked with developing schizophrenia in later life, and if mixed with tobacco can cause lung damage and cancer, especially as it is usually smoked unfiltered to increase its effects. Robert Hall (left), was sentenced to 13 years after he was found to be the head of the gang, while his brother Thomas Hall (right) was given six years behind bars . Cocaine has been linked with heart disease, with even moderate use leading to thickening of the heart muscles and major arteries leading to increase risk of heart attack and stroke, according to research. David Thompson, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail . Heavy use can also lead to paranoia, anxiety and panic attacks, and also wears away the cartilage in the middle of the nose, as with former EastEnders star Daniella Westbrook. The gang were caught despite using a mixture of 'clean' and 'dirty' mobile phones to set up meetings and avoid detection. Jailing the trio, Recorder Michael Slater said: 'I’m . satisfied from what I’ve heard that this was a well-organised, extensive . and expertly put together drug-dealing operation supplying both cannabis . and cocaine to the North East and beyond. 'The rewards were extremely . high, hence the amounts of drugs being supplied and the amount of money . that was floating around. 'In the course of this ‘snap-shot’ of the operation, cannabis and cocaine with a total street value of £1m was recovered.' As the head of the gang, Robert Hall was jailed for 13 years, while his brother, Thomas, was jailed for six years and Thompson was given four and a half years. The owner of . the house the drugs were found in, Peter Samuel Davies, 65, and his newphew, Wayne Robson, 41, were . jailed previously for five and seven years respectively for conspiracy . to supply class A and B drugs. Robert Hall, a father from Easington, was accused of using his paving company as a front for the drug enterprise, while Thompson, also a father, said he was using drug dealing as a way to better his family. The gang are thought to have imported the drugs from Europe, though the cannabis is likely to have originated in North Africa or the Middle East, while cocaine is often smuggled from South America through Africa and into the UK. Looks like: Tightly packed green leaves called 'buds', hard brown resin, or occasionally in oil form . Costs: Most commonly sold as 1/8 of an ounce for £20 . Used: Can be rolled with tobacco and smoked, put into a pipe, vaporised with special equipment and inhaled or cooked into food and eaten . Effects: feeling of relaxation, drowsiness and happiness, often accompanied with fits of laughter. Also a strong urge to eat, often known as the 'munchies'. Risks: schizophrenia, especially in those either already diagnosed with, or at risk from the condition. Lung cancer associated with smoking, a lack of motivation, and insomnia when use stops. Looks like: White power . Costs: Typically £50 per gram, though as much as £90 for higher purity . Used: Usually snorted in lines, though can also be rolled and smoked. Effects: Body high or 'buzz', feeling of alertness, mental clarity, and increased social skills. Risks: Heart attack, seizure and stroke brought on by raised heart rate and thickening of heart muscle with repeated use. Also causes paranoia, anxiety or panic attacks. Often mixed with other potentially harmful substances which can be impossible to identify in the event of an overdose.",

        "document": "Royal Mail were blasted today after they banned deliveries to more than 100 residents on a street following health and safety fears - over wonky paving slabs. Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas . Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can.

Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue.

'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago . Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service . 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping.

        "document": "By . Dominic King for The Mail on Sunday . If Jack Wilshere wanted to go quietly about his business, a tweet just before kick-off catapulted him firmly into the spotlight. As the England midfielder prepared for a game that was always going to provide a stern examination of Arsenal’s credentials, Piers Morgan proclaimed to his 4.2million followers that he ‘bet @JackWilshere has a big game today. Convinced he’s going to have a huge season. #quality’ No pressure, then. Coming just 48 hours after Arsene Wenger complained that Wilshere had been put ‘under too much pressure’, Morgan’s declaration guaranteed every step the 22-year-old took would be scrutinised. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere's Ice Bucket Challenge . Don't believe the hype! Jack Wilshere struggled to impose himself during Arsenal's draw at Everton . This, after all, is the type of game in which he should be making a difference. The thing with Wilshere, though, is that we are still waiting for him to put it all together and run a game that matters, to dominate the type of contest in which Arsenal have habitually fallen short down the years. After another troubling evening on Merseyside, the wait goes on. If Arsenal were collectively abject for 83 minutes, failing to deal with Everton’s slick passing and movement, Wilshere epitomised their shortcomings, not getting a look-in as James McCarthy and Gareth Barry dominated. He set the tone for a petulant display as early as the fifth minute, complaining without justification to referee Kevin Friend after being outmuscled by the energetic Steven Naismith. Sulking and scowling, Wilshere shuffled around on the periphery and never looked to take charge. There have, of course, been well-documented fitness problems down the years but this effort — coming after a similarly anonymous showing against Crystal Palace in which he was substituted after an hour — never threatened to get out of first gear. Why me? The England midfielder argues with referee Kevin Friend at Goodison Park on Saturday evening . Crunch! Sylvain Distin attempts to take the ball off Wilshere before Arsenal's stirring comeback . When Everton broke forward, Wilshere never had the pace to snap back and help Mathieu Flamini, while his occasionally forays into the opposition area lacked the wit or invention to cause problems. As his frustration mounted, it came as little surprise when he was booked for scything down Barry. ‘I believe at the moment he should not respond (to criticism), just focus on his game,’ Wenger argued. ‘At the moment I believe he should just focus on being fit, present and improve physically. If Wilshere can maintain his physical fitness, he can have a huge career.’ Yet that is a big ‘if’. Wilshere has long been championed as the player who will provide the fantasy in Arsenal and England’s midfield but, at present, his form merely adds weight to the acerbic comments Paul Scholes made about him last spring. When Wenger has a full complement of midfielders, where does Wilshere fit in? It should be pointed out that Wilshere — roundly booed by Everton supporters when Wenger did the decent thing and ended his evening on 73 minutes — was not the only Arsenal player to let his manager down badly. How much did you pay? Arsenal's new striker Alexis Sanchez looked hopelessly out of sorts on his own . Mesut Ozil started his first competitive game since winning the World Cup with Germany but his meaningful contributions could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Indeed, his loose ball enabled Everton to break and score their second goal before half-time. Alexis Sanchez, meanwhile, looked hopelessly out of sorts deployed as the lone front man. The experiment lasted 45 minutes, during which the Chilean never had a shot and Everton’s swagger nearly took the game away from Arsenal. All, clearly, is still not right with the Gunners. At least the changes Wenger made in the second half worked magnificently and the fighting spirit they showed to rescue the contest might be a trigger for them to have a big season. Whether the same can be said for their lacklustre No 10 remains to be seen.",
        "summary": "Arsene Wenger's side came away from Goodison Park with a point .\nLate goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud saved the day .\nRoberto Martinez's team had gone two goals up .\nJack Wilshere and Alexis Sanchez both failed to impose themselves .",

It's no accident that her most recent book is \"Unlimited: How to Build an Exceptional Life.\" Everything Jillian tackles -- including her recent gig as life adviser on \"The Doctors,\" her DVDs (such as her latest, \"Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix\"), and her intimate podcast -- is meant to help the rest of us claim a healthier, happier life. Sitting high in the hills of Southern California, the woman who calls everybody \"buddy\" is surprisingly funny and self-deprecating. And, as expected, she's incredibly open, talking about her tough tween years, how she stays motivated (and how you can, too), and the dream she's fighting to make a reality. Do you see yourself as more of a life coach than a fitness trainer? For years, I always thought it was hilarious that I was this fitness guru, because fitness was just a tool I utilized to help people improve their confidence. For me, it's never been about fitness. It's always been about helping to empower people. Health.com: Get the body you crave with celeb-inspired workouts . What is the connection between physical fitness and self-confidence? I've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you're capable of taking risks. You'll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You'll have more energy to be a better mom. You'll feel more deserving of love. What inspires you to take care of your own body? That comes from me. You can look for external sources of motivation and that can catalyze a change, but it won't sustain one. It has to be from an internal desire. You have to ask, \"Why do I want this?\" I want to be around for a family, and to feel good about my body. I want to set an example. My number-one piece of advice is: Look inside and find out what your \"why\" is. I don't care whose butt you've posted on the screen of your treadmill. Did you ever post a butt on the treadmill? I always thought Madonna was awesome, and I still do. I remember Linda Hamilton in \"Terminator 2,\" and just thinking, Really? That scene opens up and she's just banging out pull-ups, and I remember thinking, That's awesome. What other tips do you have for staying motivated? When it comes to your \"why,\" write it down and put it everywhere -- in your car, on your phone. Remind yourself constantly why you're doing what you're doing. Then remove any sort of temptation. Build a support system, whether it's a workout buddy or a mom from day care, so you have that person to call when you have a moment of weakness. Health.com: Jillian Michaels' tips for sticking with a workout . Can anyone get motivated? Are there impossible cases? Lazy doesn't exist. Lazy is a symptom of something else. The person who can't get up off their butt is just a person who's depressed. It's usually a pervasive lack of self-worth, or a feeling of helplessness. That's why fitness is so important. You have the ability to show somebody what she's capable of very quickly. As we get older, is time working against us? I really don't believe that. I've worked with people in their 50s and 60s, and I've had a very easy time taking weight off them. If you've been living in an unhealthy way, you might have been getting away with it for 10 or 15 years, but [you'll see] the cumulative effects of toxic living. It's not because you're old. If you leave a car out in the rain, it's going to rust eventually. It's a matter of, what are you eating? How are you living? There's no such thing as not being able to turn back the clock. It's never too late. You just have to change the way you live. What else will keep our bodies young? God, sleep! I really do prioritize my sleep -- I get seven to eight hours a night. Sleep, have sex (it's really good for your health), and eat organic whenever you possibly can. Health.com: Surprising health benefits of sleep . Do you ever watch yourself on TV? I find television to be a bit like a meat grinder. It's like, you have a cow, you put it through a meat grinder, and out comes a hot dog. It's almost unrecognizable. On \"Loser,\" I was a cartoon character. And I actually feel like \"The Doctors\" made a real effort to tone me down. So who is the real Jillian? I'm part Bridget Jones, part Larry David. I'm shy; I'm prude. You are? I am so prude. We didn't talk about that when I grew up. But on my podcast you see the sense of humor, the vulnerability, the passion. We talk about weight loss, bullying -- because I was bullied. When were you bullied? It didn't get really bad until I was in junior high. I was an overweight kid, and I went through a period where, oh my God, they were making cow sounds at me when I walked down the hallway and just humiliating me. Kids can be mean. My mom pulled me out of one school and put me in another, but when you wear that stigma, you start to believe it. When you wear that energy, other kids smell it like blood in the water. That's when I got into martial arts. I had a second-degree-blue-belt test, and I broke two boards with my right foot, and the next day I walked into school and no one ever picked on me again. I suddenly believed in myself and respected myself. I had some inkling of my power, so the bullying stopped instantly. Health.com: Are depressed kids bully magnets? You've spoken about your struggle to adopt a child. Is there any news? Oh, God, nothing has been this hard in my entire life. It's very complicated and it's very time-consuming and I'm committed to the process, but two years later, no update. Theoretically, I've been matched with a child. Now I'm just trying to get her home. How do you decompress? Yoga. I've been doing a lot of it. It takes me out of my own mind; I have to be present and think about my form. I find it very calming and grounding; it makes me happy. Know what I mean, buddy? Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .",

        "document": "Scientists have grown 'fully-functioning' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders. By transplanting cells from a human into a mouse, paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the 'real' thing. Doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome (SBS)  - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years. Paediatrics have created tissue-engineered small intestine (Tesi) tissue (part of the small intestine's duodenum (pictured) that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine. During tests the tissue proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones . The research was led by Dr Tracy Grikscheit from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). CHLA had previously shown that tissue-engineered small intestine tissue could be ‘grown’ by implanting human donor tissue into mice. However, in initial studies - published in 2011 in the biomedical journal Tissue Engineering, Part A - the intestine created had a limited range of functions. As part of the new study, the researchers created Tesi that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine. In particular, the Tesi developed contains the mucosal lining - or barrier - seen in fully-grown intestines. The small intestine is a tubular structure that carries food from the stomach up to the colon and its main function is to help with digestion. The small intestine increases 20 times in length as a person ages, from around 78 inches (200cm) in a newborn baby, to almost six metres (20 feet) long. It is typically three times the height of the child or adult and is the part of the intestines where 90 per cent of digestion and food absorption takes place. The remaining 10 per cent occurs in the stomach and large intestine. As food travels through the small intestine, it absorbs nutrients and minerals. Chemical digestion uses enzymes to break down food into a form that can then be absorbed into tissues of the body. Once at the colon, the large intestine carries it to the rectum. The main function of this organ is to aid in digestion. And, during tests the Tesi proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones. Mice were chosen for the study because mouse Tesi is ‘highly similar’ to the Tesi derived from human cells. For example, both contain important building blocks such as the stem and progenitor cells that continue to regenerate the intestine as a living tissue replacement. The researchers took cells from human intestine tissue and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution. This solution was fitted onto a so-called polymer scaffold - a structure used to help the cells and tissue develop - which was then implanted into a mouse. Four weeks later, the Tesi was harvested and tested. Scientists discovered it was able to break down sugars into glucose, and found the cells within the engineered tissue developed in close proximity to other specialised cells. These specialised cells are said to be necessary in healthy human intestine to create a fully functioning organ. ‘We have shown that we can grow tissue-engineered small intestine that is more complex than other stem cell or progenitor cell models that are currently used to study intestinal regeneration and disease, and proven it to be fully functional as it develops from human cells,’ said Dr Grikscheit. ‘Demonstrating the functional capacity of this tissue-engineered intestine is a necessary milestone on our path toward one day helping patients with intestinal failure.’ Mice (stock image) were chosen for the study because mouse Tesi is ‘highly similar’ to Tesi from human cells. The researchers took cells from human intestines and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution, which was then implanted into a mouse. Four weeks later, the Tesi was harvested and succesfully tested . The research was published in the American Journal of Physiology: GI & Liver, and brings surgeons a step closer to helping human patients using this regenerative medicine technique. In particular, it could be used to treat short bowel syndrome - a major cause of intestinal failure, particularly in premature babies and newborns with congenital intestinal problems. Tesi may also, one day, replace intestinal transplantation and could solve the problem of donor shortages. Without enough intestinal length, babies are dependent on intravenous feeding, which can cause liver damage. Intestinal failure occurs in more than 24 out of 100,000 live births, with nearly a third of patients dying within five years.",

        "document": "By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:31 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:41 EST, 26 February 2014 . Less than one in 10 female soldiers want a combat job, a survey of the 170,000 women serving in the U.S. Army has revealed - and for those who want to serve in battle, the vast majority agree that physical standards must not be lowered to accommodate women. With roughly one in five Army . positions considered combat-related, commanders are turning to science . to find a unisex standard to judge which soldiers physically have the . right stuff to fight wars. Testing . at Fort Stewart and other U.S. bases is breaking away from the Army's . longtime standards for physical fitness — pushups, sit-ups and two-mile . runs — to focus instead on battlefield tasks, such as dragging a wounded . comrade to safety or installing and removing the heavy barrel of the 25 . mm gun mounted on Bradley vehicles. Heavy lifting: U.S. Army Corporal Jacqueline Beachum carries a 65-pound T.O.W. missile several yards before loading it into a launcher on a Bradley fighting vehicle . Only eight per cent of army women who responded to the survey said they wanted to fight on the battlefield. Of . those, an overwhelming number said they'd like to be a Night Stalker – a . member of the elite special operations helicopter crews who perhaps are . best known for flying the Navy Seals into Osama bin Laden’s compound in . 2011. Last year, the Pentagon ordered that women must have the same opportunities to serve in combat jobs as men, with thousands of positions slated to open to both genders in 2016. Researchers also found that soldiers . of both genders are nervous about women entering combat jobs, but say . they are determined to do it fairly. The . study showed men are worried about losing their jobs to women and women . are worried they will be seen as getting jobs because of their gender . and not their qualifications.

Spc Karen Arvizu, left, puts on her hydration pack in preparation for her role as a volunteer in a physical demands study . David Brinkley, deputy chief of staff . for operations at the Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Fort . Eustis in Virginia, said some people think the Army is coming up with . unrealistic requirements while others believe standards will be lower to . let women fight on the front lines. 'We intend to do neither. That's why we based this on the actual thing you have to do,' he said. At . Fort Stewart in Georgia, a volunteer group of soldiers - 100 men and 60 . women - are spending a month drilling on the most physically . challenging tasks demanded of infantrymen, cavalry scouts, mortar . launchers and tank crews. In . March, scientists from the Army's Research Institute for Environmental . Medicine will have the troops perform those tasks while wearing heart . rate monitors, masks that monitor oxygen intake and other equipment to . study the effects of their physical exertion. One . of the volunteers, Spc Artrice Scott, said she has no intention of . trading in her job as an Army cook to join an infantry platoon or an . armor unit. But she sees the testing as a great opportunity to lead the . way for women in the U.S. military. 'The . heaviest thing we lift in the kitchen is boxes of frozen chicken, 45 . pounds,' said Scott, 29, of Mobile, Alabama. 'And you don't have to lift . those over your head.'

During . a training session Tuesday, Scott shaved 45 seconds off her previous . best time carrying two anti-tank missiles into a Bradley armored vehicle . and loading them into the turret. Army . commanders say there are no doubts that women have the mental and . technical abilities needed. Only their ability to perform the most . arduous physical tasks has been questioned. The . survey released yesterday found there were nagging stereotypes. Male . soldiers fretted that their unit's readiness will be degraded because of . what they term 'women issues,' such as pregnancy and menstrual cycles. Or they worried that women incapable of the physical demands would be . brought in anyway.

However, . the survey also showed that only about eight per cent of Army women said . they wanted combat jobs. Brinkley said such limited interest also is in . line with what other countries, such as Norway, have seen as they . integrated women into combat roles. Major General . Mike Murray, commanding general at Fort Stewart, watched Tuesday as . coed groups of soldiers set up heavy 120mm mortars on a practice field. An . officer with 32 years of infantry experience, Murray said it's time to . open combat jobs to women and 'this is going to get studied to death' in . order for the Army to prove to naysayers that women soldiers are . physically capable. The . volunteer group at Fort Stewart includes a mix of combat veterans and . newcomers, but it didn't take long for the group to gel after some . initial awkwardness. 'It was . almost like a high school dance where you had the guys over here and . the girls over there,' Murray said. 'A week later, it was amazing how . fast teams form.' Army Chief of Staff General Raymond Odierno speaks at the Pentagon . Giving . soldiers a month to prepare meant women who have never been trained to . scale a six-foot wall or pull a casualty from a tank have had time to . learn the proper techniques before they are tested for real next month. Staff Sergeant . Terry Kemp, a cavalry scout who has helping train the Fort Stewart . volunteers, said female soldiers started to catch up with their male . counterparts after two weeks of training. Missile . toting drills that initially took the men seven minutes were taking . women 12 minutes to complete, he said. But by week three, men and women . had trimmed their times to about four minutes. Those . who still insist women can't perform as well as men in combat 'can beat . their chests about it all day,' said Kemp, a veteran of Iraq and . Afghanistan. 'But eventually it's going to happen.' Exactly what sort of fitness tests or standards will come out of the Army's study remains to be seen. There . are no current fitness requirements for serving in combat positions . beyond the Army's standard physical fitness test for all soldiers — . which includes pushups, situps and a 2-mile run and grades men and women . on different scales. Brinkley . said the Army took a lesson from fire departments by not focusing on . soldier's ability to perform pushups or pullups, which favor men because . they test upper body strength. He . said officials realize women do physical tasks differently, using more . core strength and legs. By focusing on tasks rather than exercises, Army . officials hope to eliminate gender bias from their study. Taking . a break from toting anti-tank missiles at Fort Stewart, Arvizu said she . found the heavy lifting to be humbling. And though she felt encouraged . by her male colleagues, she had no desire to give up driving a truck and . join a combat unit. 'It's not that I came, I saw and conquered,' she said. 'But I came, I saw and I did my best.'",

Footage of the unnamed soldier performing a series of ballet-style pirouettes while on guard duty has become an internet sensation, watched by more than 1.7 million people on YouTube. But Army top brass have reacted furiously to the video and are ready to hand down a custodial sentence. Scroll down for video . The Grenadier Guardsman who broke strict rules by dancing on parade outside Buckingham Palace is potentially facing a 21-day prison sentence and a £1,000 fine . The guardsman faces hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex. He also faces losing his wages for the period of his sentence – about £1,000. A source said: ‘There’s no charge in the disciplinary manuals for silly walks and dancing on parade because nobody in living memory has had the cheek to do it. ‘But this guardsman’s senior officers were livid when they saw the footage. His conduct is contrary to everything being a guardsman is about. ‘He is facing a stint in the jail with no pay and, when he returns to the Grenadiers, he could lose privileges such as going out in London with the other lads in his company. Twenty-one days has been discussed as a prison sentence. The hierarchy want to put a marker down so no guardsman dares prance around outside Buckingham Palace again.’ Footage of the unnamed soldier performing a series of ballet-style pirouettes while on guard duty has become an internet sensation, watched by more than 1.7 million people on YouTube . Last night, defence sources confirmed that Army bosses are taking legal advice before they convene a disciplinary hearing with the soldier, now nicknamed ‘Private Dancer’, who is based at Wellington Barracks close to the Palace. The Queen is understood to have been away when the soldier entertained the crowds. As tourists laughed and cheered, he repeatedly spun around, stopped mid-stride with his foot in the air for several seconds, brushed dust off his rifle and bent down as if to pick something up. The footage was uploaded on to the internet last month. But senior officers now believe he should be formally disciplined. Under the Armed Forces Act 2006, a soldier may receive a custodial sentence for ‘conduct prejudicial to good order and Service discipline’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the video. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’ Do you know the identity of the pirouetting palace guardsman?

        "document": "By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 07:20 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 26 March 2013 . A rotund opera singer has lost an impressive five stone and is in training to complete a 300 mile charity cycle after adopting a caveman diet . David Webb also  took up Cross Fit, the new fitness phenomenon involving constantly varied, high intensity workouts, and went from an unhealthy 19 stone and 40 per cent body fat to a fit and muscular 13 stone. Part of the successful opera group Amore, David has performed across the globe, on multiple TV shows and even serenaded the Queen on the royal barge at her jubilee, but his confidence on stage has hidden a lifelong struggle with his weight. Write caption here . David, pictured second right with Amore members (l-r) Peter Brathwaite, Monica McGhee and Victoria Gray, knew he had to loose weight to be fit for singing . The 29-year-old, who trained at the Royal College of Music, says although he was always large, he was very active as a child. ‘I was never taught about food as a child. I was never told how exactly people got fat.’ David, who played rugby and football throughout his childhood, says he began to over eat when his parents got divorced. ‘A lot of it was eating to comfort myself,’ admits David, who also suffered bullying at school because of his size. ‘I’d eat so much I would almost be sick, then start all over again. I’d hate myself for doing it’ he says. However, his high level of activity meant that David remained reasonably fit, and aged 18, he was able to run the London Marathon for his little sister Hannah, who was wheelchair bound throughout her childhood with ME. David, seen here aged 7, says he was never really taught about healthy nutrition as a child . David was active in his childhood, but the weight still crept on due to his diet, especially during his gap years . David at the end of a Crossfit workout, consisting of 30 handstand press ups, 40 pull ups, 50 24kg kettlebell swings, 60 sit-ups and 70 burpees with a time cap of 20 minutes . ‘I spoke to Hannah about what it was like, about feeling each movement was a monumental effort and being trapped. It sounded a bit like ‘hitting the wall’ in a marathon. ‘I thought, if I can do the race, it’s just a tiny bit of what she goes through everyday.’ Despite completing this extreme physical feat David says the weight continued to pile on during his gap years, when he was singing in the Truro Cathedral choir. Amore's success has seen them appear on numerous TV shows like ITV's Daybreak. David explains that even in opera 'you have to look as good as you sound nowadays' David adopted the Caveman diet of basic, natural and largely unprocessed foods to get so svelte, though he still allows himself a 'fatterday' each week . Working in a bakery in the day, David would start eating at the very start of the day, enjoying the pastries and breakfast foods the bistro served. ‘I could eat two walnut and maple pastries, then scrambled eggs with four or five slices of buttered toast just for breakfast.’ ‘It was all beige food. Then after I’d sung in the choir we’d head down the pub and I’d have five or six pints. ‘There’s a stereotype of the fat opera singer, but you actually need to be incredibly fit to sing. David aged 22, just before he started at the Royal College of Music . ‘Nowadays you have to look as good as you sound,’ David explains. When he started at the Royal college of Music, weighing a hefty 19 stone, David realised if he was to continue to pursue his dream of becoming an opera singer on the global stage he would have to tackle his growing waistline. He adopted the Palaeolithic diet, often called the cave man diet, based on foods that might have been eaten by out hunter gatherer ancestors. David's diet shifted from high fat and sugar foods to natural unprocessed foods, with lots of protein. A typical days food became scrambled eggs , smoked mackerel and spinach for breakfast, chicken and steamed broccoli for lunch and a ‘palaeo lasagne’, made without any pasta, for dinner. In addition David began ‘Crossfit’, a fitness program, founded by Greg Glassman, that is fast growing in popularity, involving high intensity bouts of exercise for short periods, focusing on core strength. ‘Workouts last for about 10-20 minutes each. The idea is to challenge your body so the workouts are constantly changing. ‘A lot of the exercises are functional, so they are designed to actually be helpful in everyday life.’ A session usually involved high impact cardio with weights as well as skill based exercises like working with Olympic rings, handstands, push ups and burpies. ‘Although each session is short, the high intensity means they are exhausting and really challenge your body. I’m often on the floor at the end!’ says David, who began to notice the effects on his body almost immediately. ‘It was incredible. With each month more and more people would comment on my weight loss. ‘But what surprised me was the comments about my attitude, how much more positive I was.’ David and Peter met Harry Styles backstage at this years Brit awards. As Amore's success has continued, so has David's physical transformation . It was during his time at the Royal College that David met fellow Amore members Monica McGhee, Peter Brathwaite and Victoria Gray and formed the group. As they went from success to success, David’s frame continued to shrink. Each week he allows himself a day off his diet, which he calls ‘fatterday', where he can eat exactly what he likes. David, seen here after completing the Men's Health 10km assault course, says the biggest change has been in his attitude and confidence . ‘I’m obsessed with Oreo milkshakes so I usually make sure I get one of them in! ‘The feeling of health has over taken the feeling of vanity now, I love feeling physically fit. ‘The confidence I have gained is what motivates me to keep going.  I find I’m craving the bad foods less and less as time goes on.’ ‘The only downside is none of my suits fit me anymore!’ he says. David is now using his new found fitness to raise money for cleft palette charity Operation Smile by cycling 300 miles in three days. He is hoping to raise £2,400 which is enough for 16 children to have a life-changing operation. ‘In 3 days I will cover over 300 miles, and although it's April, it's most likely that it will be raining for at least two of the three days! ‘I was first introduced to Operation Smile and their work, when 'Amore' were invited to perform at their Christmas Service last year. The commitment, energy and huge hearts of the staff and volunteers made me want to do something else to raise money and awareness of their work than just sing. David has pledged that he will cycle all the way home again if he reaches 3 times his original goal. You can donate towards David’s cycle here . Visit Amore's official website here .",

Catanzaro, a 5-foot gymnast weighing 100 pounds, says that she intends to use her newfound Internet celebrity to spread a positive message of physical fitness to young women nationwide. 'It's nice to look good and have a great . body, but you enjoy your life so much more if you are fit,' she said. 'That is the message I definitely want to get out.' Catanzaro has been doing gymnastics for most of her life, and was a gymnast at Towson University, which prepared her to have the strength to overcome the challenge. She will need it when she arrives in Las Vegas for the national finals, in which contestants compete on the US version of Mount Midoriyama, the final course for 'Sasuke' also bearing that name. While she made it look easy, Catanzaro did experience some trepidation while going through the Dallas course. 'The ring toss was something new this year and it was definitely a . challenge, but I just took it slow and tried to stay calm,' she told People Magazine. 'When I missed . the rung a few ties and swung out and I could hear the audience go, \"Oh!\"' Kacy's message to her fans, posted on Instagram on Thursday . 'It's nice to look good and have a great body, but you enjoy your life so much more if you are fit,' says Catanzaro . Catanzaro pulls herself up, displaying her excellent fitness . Despite the challenges, victory was sweet for Catanzaro. 'There’s really no ways to explain that feeling when you have this goal . and you work so hard to get there and that moment of conquering it was . just so amazing,' she told USA Today. 'I was just so happy to have done that for . myself and all the other women that don’t think it’s possible to compete . against [men] …' As for what she plans to do in the future, Catanzaro said that she hopes to become a motivational speaker in school to encourage young people to be physically fit. For now, Catanzaro competes on the NBC show in addition to 'Alpha Warrior', a similar style competition that tours the United States. Her boyfriend is also a contestant in both competitions.",

Hodgson, who admired Sterling’s honesty, said: ‘I should speak to Brendan, but it really is very simple and I am sure he understands the situation. Raheem has played a lot of games recently and it is the first year in the Champions League for Liverpool for a while, so the games have been quite high pressure. ‘He looked a bit tired when he came up and I will just tell him that — that he was feeling a bit tired and I made the decision to play (Adam) Lallana, but he recovered well enough. ‘He is 100 per cent fully fit and really it was just a decision on my part. Brendan has been talking about the pressures Raheem has been under and the fatigue that may have set in a little bit, so I am pretty sure he will be dealing over the next month with Raheem as he sees fit.’ Hodgson made another attempt to move away from the idea that the players are run into the ground when away with England.

Hodgson said: ‘Raheem might say it is something that is becoming ingrained in him and that he felt the need to talk about being tired more than he would normally do. ‘I don’t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two-day recovery. ‘I would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two-day recoveries. On the other hand, it could easily be like this time when we did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training the day after the (first) game and we did 40 minutes including warm up the day before the (second) game and that was at a fairly low level intensity.’ Rodgers criticised England’s training methods in September after Daniel Sturridge ruptured his thigh muscle .",

A morbidly obese bus inspector who tipped the scales at 31st 7lb has shed more than half his body weight after being shamed for taking up multiple seats on the tube. Philip Kettle, 52, from Romford, was carrying around the equivalent of 128 bags of sugar in weight after eating unhealthily for almost two decades. But after warnings from doctors and daily angry stares from commuters, Philip decided to overhaul his diet and now weighs a trim 14st 7lb. Slimline: Bus conductor Philip Kettle poses in one of his old XXXXXL blazers after losing a colossal 17st . Big change: Philip now weighs just 14st 7lb but used to weigh a mighty 31st 7lb and was morbidly obese . 'When you are that size you become . withdrawn, withdrawn from society, you don't want to go out to things . because people will look at you,' Phillip revealed. 'You . become very self conscious that you are being scrutinised. Looks are . one thing but the emotional side also takes a right pounding. 'I was ashamed. I was not proud of what I had done to myself over the years.' At his biggest, Philip had a 60in waist and struggled with simple activities such as climbing the stairs and keeping up with his five-year-old grandson. 'I was eating chocolate bars and various junk food all the time - I have a very sweet tooth,' he added. 'But my health started to deteriorate. I had very high blood pressure. It was quite a shock to hear what the GP said. I was at that point in my life that I realised I had put my family through a lot by being this way.' Particularly hard for Philip was the realisation that he might not live to see his grandson grow up, which made him increasingly desperate to shed the pounds. 'I was very overweight throughout my daughter's lives but now I have a grandson,' he said. 'I . didn't want him remembering his grandfather like that. I couldn't do . anything about the past but I could so something about the future. Relieved: Wife Denise, 52, is thrilled that her husband has finally managed to shift the pounds . Unhealthy: Philip was warned that he might not see his grandson grow up unless he lost weight . 'I . had just carried on and put off doing something about it for years. But . it got to a point where I could not carry on. It was becoming too much.' Philip's solution was to join Weightwatcher's where he was swiftly put on a programme that replaced daily English breakfasts and carb-laden sandwiches with healthy salads, fruit and vegetables. Snacking was banned, while weekly weigh-ins helped to keep him on track as the pounds slowly but surely dropped off. He also started walking everywhere and two years later, he now weighs just 14st 7lb and has a trim 34in waist. 'My . blood pressure is back to normal, I am physically fit and I'm off all . my medication - the doctor said I have got my health back,' said Philip. 'I used to go . everywhere in the car, even short journeys, but now I walk everywhere. I . walk to work and as much as I can and only use the car once a week. 'I'm even doing a 26-mile walk for charity, which before was something I could never of imagined doing. 'Everything has changed now. I have . changed so much as a person and really come out of my shell. I've never . been so happy. I look at myself in the mirror now and I can't believe . it. 'My wife says I now . turn heads for the right reasons. There are so many things I can do now . that I would not do before.'

        "document": "Jeb Bush, the newest front-runner among Republicans seeking their party's 2016 presidential nomination, smoked marijuana in high school – an activity he describes as 'pretty common' at the tony Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He told The Boston Globe in an interview published ahead of Sunday's edition that 'I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover.' Both activities were strictly forbidden at the time – and still are – and could have gotten him expelled. But 'it was pretty common,' he insisted. Bush, once a 6-foot, 4-inch high school senior, was also seen as a bully by some of his classmates, notably one who weighed less than 100 pounds. Another said he was 'a cigarette smoker and \"toker\".' Reactions to the news were varied. A spokesman for potential Republican presidential challenger Donald Trump told Daily Mail Online that 'Jeb put out the least of his substance issues today.' Scroll down for video . UP IN SMOKE: Jeb Bush (2nd from right, in the background) was 17 when this photo was taken as his father the future presdient conceded the Texas governor's race to future vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen . GETS YOU RIGHT HERE: Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, experimented with marijuana at his prep school in Massachusetts . 'THAT WAS THE POINT': Barack Obama told an interviewer in 2008 that he definitely inhaled when he smoked pot, and reminisced about his pothead friends, the infamous 'Choom Gang . News reports of Bush's past pot smoking date back to at least 1998, but his frank admission is new. It's common for presidential hopefuls to 'dump' unflattering news about themselves early in election cycles, in the hope that it will be considered 'old news' by the time heir opponents gear up opposition-research activities. The St. Petersburg Times in Bush's home state of Florida profiled him in October 1998 when he was the state's commerce secretary. 'The academics and the competitiveness' at Andover 'jolted him,' the Times reported. 'He nearly flunked his first year.' 'He began to experiment with drugs, smoking marijuana on more than one occasion and drinking alcohol.' Bush all but admitted the reporting was spot-on at the time. 'I still adhere to the belief that there should be a statute of limitations on behavior,' he said. 'There's got to be some tolerance for our imperfections. I'm imperfect. I was more imperfect when I was young.' Five years later, when he was nearing the end of his first term as Florida's governor, the Washington Post treated Bush's marijuana-smoking days as anything but a bombshell. 'Jeb struggled with his course work' at Andover, the Post reported in February 2003. He 'missed Texas and experimented with marijuana.' Several of the potential 2016 Republican pesidential candidates have admitted smoking pot in the past: . Aside from Jeb Bush, there are at least four. Squeaky-clean moral crusader Rick Santorum, a former Senator from Pennsylvania, awkwardly admitted in 2011 that 'when I was in college ... I smoked pot and that was something that I did when I was in college … It was something that I’m not proud of, but I did.' 'I did and I admitted it,' Santorum added. 'I would encourage people not to do so. It was not all it’s made up to be.' Newt Gingrich said in 1995 when he was Speaker of the House that smoking pot 'was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era.' Former New York Governor George Pataki put his pot experimentation on the record during his first campaign for the office in 1994. And Sarah Palin, the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2008, told the Anchorage Daily News two years earlier during her Alaska governorship that she smoked pot in her pre-politics days. 'I can't claim a Bill Clinton and say that I never inhaled,' she said. College friends of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul have said he joined them in the occasional toke, but he hasn't admitted it. 'Randy smoked pot, [and] he made fun of Baptists,' a former cohort from Paul's Baylor University secret society, the NoZe Brotherhood, said in 2010. Former Preident George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, wrote in 1971 that 'Jebby is going to need some help I am sure.' 'He is a free and independent spirit and I don't want him to get totally out of touch with the family.' The Globe interviewed Peter Tibbetts, a Bush contemporary at Andover,who recalled that he had helped Bush bully another student before he himself was kicked out of school for doing drugs. 'Their target was a short classmate whom they taunted, and then sewed his pajama bottoms so that they were impossible to put on,' the Globe reports. Tibbetts said he is remorseful for participating in making 'cruel' sport of the smaller kid. Bush said he doesn't remember it that way. 'I don’t believe that is true,” he said, referring to others' accounts of his alleged bullying. 'It was 44 years ago and it is not possible for me to remember.' But his classmates remember. 'Jeb Bush was large, physically imposing, and traveled in a crowd that was I guess somewhat threatening to an outsider like myself,' former dormmate Gregg Hamilton said. 'I saw him as a cigarette smoker and \"toker\" and someone that was comfortable being in charge of a group. I was small physically, and small at an all-male boarding school [that], at that time, was a bit of a hostile environment for the kids.' Hamilton recalled the dor, Pemberton Cottage, as a 'sort of a \"Lord of the Flies\" situation, at least as I saw it.' Bush has talked about his Andover years before, casting himself in one Miami Herald interview as 'a cynical little turd at a cynical school.' 'It was a difficult time for me,' he told the Herald. 'I was 14 when I left Houston to go to Andover and it was a very cynical time. The school for all sorts of reasons in the early 70s was cynical, not the same way it is now. It was a very Darwinian place.' Despite the national news a politician with TNC in his history makes, it's nothing new. President Barack Obama famously smoked weed in his youth as part of a group of friends he affectionately called the 'Choom Gang.' Bill Clinton, asked about his pot-smoking past during the 1992 presdiential campaign, admitted that 'when I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale and never tried it again.' The late Christopher Hitchens, who attended Oxford University with Clinton during the future president's Rhodes Scholar year, claimed later that Clinton was partial to pot brownies instead.

IMAGE: Conservative media figure AJ Delgado says the admission will help Bush more than it will hurt him . Obama, by contrast, made no bones about enjoying a good toke. 'When I was a kid, I inhaled, frequently,' he said in 2008. 'That was the point.' President George W. Bush, Jeb's older brother, reportedly experimented with cocaine during his youth. He never explicitly admitted smoking marijuana, although he hinted at it in discussions with his biographer Douglas Wead. 'I wouldn't answer the marijuana questions,' the 43rd president recalled. 'You know why? Because I don't want some little kid doing what I tried.' President John F. Kennedy tried marijuana for chronic back pain, according to the book 'John F. Kennedy: A Biography,' which drew its account from former Washington Post executive Jim Truitt. 'On the evening of July 16, 1962, according to Jim Truitt, Kennedy and Mary Meyer smoked marijuana together.' Meyer was reportedly one of Kennedy's mistresses. 'It was pretty common,' Jeb Bush said of his pot-smoking days in prep school . FIELDS OF DREAMS: James Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking marijuana . 'The president smoked three of the six joints Mary brought to him,' according to the book. 'At first he felt no effects. Then he closed his eyes and refused a fourth joint. \"Suppose the Russians did something now,\" he said.' Several of America's founding fathers smoked the drug, according to the pot-advocacy magazine High Times. In the late eighteenth and early ninetenth centuries, the hemp plant that yields marijuana was grown widely in the New World for non-recreational purposes including fibers and oil. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison all cultivated hemp. Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking hemp. Presidents Zachary Taylor and Andrew Jackson both wrote letters that mentioned smoking marijuana with American troops during their time in battle. James Monroe openly smoked hashish during his years as U.S. Ambassador to France and, according to one biographer, kept up the habit until he died at age 73. And Thomas Jefferson, High Times claims, smuggled hemp seeds from China that were 'known for their potency.'",

        "document": "Free range chickens may not live the comfortable lives we have been led to believe, according to a leading British vet. Research shows that chickens which are allowed to roam free are in fact more likely to catch disease, get injured and die earlier than those kept in cages. Eggs from free range hens now make up 45 per cent of the British market – a huge increase from just 1 per cent in 1980. Cluck happy... or not: Chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases . Supermarkets and celebrity chefs would have us believe that free range chickens are happier, healthier and live more natural lives than those in battery farms. But chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases, according to Barry Thorp of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh. They are also more likely to break their bones because they have not been bred to survive an outdoor life, he said. Recent regulations mean that chicken houses are no longer the tiny squalid cages they once were. Dr Thorp, speaking during a debate on chicken welfare at the British Science Festival in Birmingham yesterday, said: ‘I think that for long-term sustainability, free range systems do not work. ‘I’m certainly very comfortable with buying eggs from furnished cages. I have no issues with that at all. ‘I think free range has some merits but it also has many problems as well. I don’t see it having a long-term sustainability and that worries me.’ Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu, posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control . Dr Thorp said the boom in free range has been driven by the idea that chickens live better lives – a message that has been amplified by large retailers. ‘Supermarkets love free range because they can make a bigger margin,’ he said. But chickens kept in large fields are far more likely to pass diseases to each other and on to wild birds and ducks. He warned that the increase in the number of free-range chickens raises the risk of a major epidemic of bird flu. ‘We have been lucky in this country that we haven’t had a major bird flu outbreak,’ he said. Dr Thorp, a specialised poultry vet, added: ‘Having a physical barrier between chickens works – cages stop disease because if nothing goes between A and B, disease does not travel between A and B. ‘When different chickens and wild birds come into contact with each other and their droppings, disease spreads. ‘As a vet I make far more money from farmers who have got birds kept free range than those kept in cages.’ The spread of disease between chickens in fields and ducks in nearby rivers is a particular risk, he said. Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu, posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control. Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk, instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control. Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk, instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control . Dr Victoria Sandilands, of Scotland’s Rural College, said free range birds have a mortality rate of 8 to 10 per cent, far higher than caged hens’ death rate of 2 to 4 per cent. Free range hens are also twice as likely to have fractured bones as those kept in cages. Cages are also far better than they used to be, she said. She added: ‘Ten years ago cages used to have a wire floor with access to food and water but nothing else. ‘From 2012 only furnished or enriched cages have been permitted across the EU.’ Cages now have to contain nesting areas, separated from the rest of the cage, with a ‘scratch floor’, a perching area for every hen and more than seven square metres per chicken. She told the Birmingham audience: ‘Furnished cages provide a safe, clean environment, and laying hens are generally physically healthy. The ability to perform many natural behaviours has also improved greatly.’ Mia Fernyhough, senior scientific officer at the RSPCA, admitted that free range farming systems are far from ideal. ‘Free range is more complex so it takes more careful management to do it well,’ she said. ‘There is increased risk of mortality and increased risk of disease and injury. ‘But it can be managed well. Free range has a much, much greater potential for higher welfare.’",

        "document": "Sochi (CNN) -- Amid security anxieties, indignation over Russian politics, the furore over unfinished media accommodation and astronomic costs, one key component of the Winter Olympics has been all but forgotten: the thousands of athletes streaming into Sochi. When not competing, they will spend a large chunk of their time at the Olympic Village -- the traditional home for most of those taking part. Sochi has two to boast: one in the imposing landscape of the Caucasus mountains; the other on the Black Sea's sunny northern banks. These are dwellings that resemble small towns -- you need a lot of rooms to house 6,000 athletes from 85 nations. The coastal destination surely proves an easy sell to any would-be resident for the month of February. If holiday brochures existed for a stay in the Olympic Village, it might read: . \"Upmarket holiday camp, with pleasant residential buildings that come inclusive with very own McDonald's, round-the-clock dining room with flavors from around the world, fully-fitted games room -- boasting table tennis, pool tables and computer games -- free bar and 24-hour gym, in great location just off the beach. \"There are grass lawns to sit out on and enjoy the sun (the climate is so favorable they say there are only three seasons, winter is skipped on the coast), traffic is non-existent and crime is wonderfully low. \" Just as importantly for the athletes, their accommodation is a stone's throw away from some of the best winter sport facilities in the world, making it possible to have your breakfast and walk to the ice rink in under 10 minutes -- a first in Winter Olympic history. But with any holiday accommodation, and especially when you have thousands of happy campers to please, there have been a few teething problems. So the management would like to apologize for the swimming pools not being ready -- they are currently empty of water -- and an inability to fulfil the promise of creating landscapes in and around the athletes' blocks. \"In the brochure the organizers provided to the teams this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary ... but I don't think they were able to plant the trees in time,\" Team GB short-track speed skater Charlotte Gilmartin told CNN . \"But apart from that everything else has been great!\" added Gilmartin as she follows the gravel path which navigates across an area of wasteland separating the dining facilities from her team's apartment building. We'll guess from that she'd give it a four-star rating as she crosses the road and opens the door to a building which, on every floor, has balconies festooned with British flags. Flags which, incidentally, have already become a source of rivalry between athletes from competing nations, if the images posted on Twitter and Instagram are anything to go by -- the bigger the better. For the duration of the Games, Gilmartin will call this home. Once inside, after traveling up four flights in an elevator that still has that freshly-installed smell, we walk down a clean, window-lit passageway to a door that has a Union Jack flag doormat daubed with a \"Welcome\" message. Gilmartin's airy, open-plan room consists of two single beds -- she shares it with a teammate -- with sea views from a decent-sized balcony, a modern bathroom, double-glazed windows, storage cupboards and an ample lounge area with television. Orange bikes . As with all Olympic Games, the organizers provide teams with a fully functional room with basic furniture -- similar in quality to a well-known Swedish brand by the look of it -- and then allow the respective Olympic associations to adorn the rooms as they see fit. In Team GB's case, this entails some patriotic pictures hung on the wall, the provision of \"good luck\" cuddly toys, themed cushions and the aforementioned doormat. Despite reports of pillow shortages in the mountain cluster village, both beds boast two cushions apiece. Each room's crowning glory is surely the uniquely patterned quilt for the beds that can then be taken home afterwards by competitors as a souvenir -- as is traditional for all Games . The 2014 quilts are light-blue with stitched diamonds of colored flowers. Very nice. Very Russian. So if there have been problems with hotels occupied by journalists, it seems the Winter Games athletes are having a very different experience. \"After five days I have no problems,\" says Russian speed skater Ekaterina Lobysheva -- a veteran of three Olympic Games -- speaking to CNN over a lunch of Chinese noodles. \"And the food is very good. I prefer Asian and Italian food, which is good because they have a cook here from Italy too. \"I'm lucky, I don't really have a diet because I use so many calories. This is the first time my country has hosted the Winter Games and I hope these facilities will help popularize my sport.\" Finnish ice hockey player Susanna Tapan also gave the accommodation the thumbs up. \"It's very exciting. This is my first Olympics, and I'm enjoying it very much so far. The accommodation has been great.\" One of the most striking attractions of the village is the way different nations bring their own distinctive characteristics. Most notably the Dutch, who are pedaling around on orange bikes. There may not be the recording studio that London 2012 laid on for the athletes, but between the gym, the bar, the dining room, the pool tables and the beach, there is plenty to keep them occupied. And if spectators find their hotels are closer to the standard of the athletes' village compared to that of the media accommodation, we might even start to get excited about the great sporting prospect that awaits. Let the Games begin!",

Brain surgery has helped women with severe anorexia put on weight for the first time since their illness began, say researchers. They used a ‘pacemaker’ to stimulate areas of the brain responsible for symptoms of depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts involved in the eating disorder. Within nine months half the patients had gained weight and their symptoms had improved, while others had stabilised their weight. The pacemaker stimulates areas of the brain responsible for depression, anxiety and obsessive thoughts . Researchers in Canada used a technique . known as deep brain stimulation (DBS) which has successfully helped . people suffering from Parkinson’s and chronic pain. Patients . having DBS are fitted with a neurostimulator, a device similar to a . heart pacemaker, which is connected to electrodes placed in certain . parts of the brain. The . electrical implant is connected to a small battery under the skin in the . person’s chest or abdomen to generate small electrical signals to . stimulate the brain. When switched on, the patient benefits from the blocking of abnormal nerve signals which trigger the disabling symptoms. The . small study of six patients reported in The Lancet medical journal was . designed to test safety, but researchers said DBS appeared to be capable . of treating severe anorexia. In . a commentary, UK experts Professor Janet Treasure and Professor Ulrike . Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, said the . findings were ‘promising’ for patients who had failed on conventional . treatments. They said ‘New effective treatments for these patients are sorely needed. ‘The . fact that the procedure was associated in some patients with . improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance, . since such improvements will go some way towards reassuring patients . that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up . without making them feel better.’ There are around 90,000 Britons with eating disorders including anorexia, which often start in the early teens. A record number of 1,600 people - mostly girls and women - were given hospital treatment for anorexia in 2011. The . parents of Laura Willmott, 18, last month spoke out against the care . system for failing their daughter who collapsed and died after starving . herself to barely five stone in weight. She . had been battling anorexia for five years, but was discharged from . hospital after 11 days when doctors ruled she was ‘physically fit’ without telling her family because she was over 18. She died from a . heart attack two weeks later. Tragedy: Laura Wilmott, 18, died after a five-year battle with anorexia . The new study recruited six women aged between 24 and 57, who had been suffering from anorexia for between four and 37 years. Researchers based at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify a specific area of the brain previously targeted for DBS in patients with depression. The target area was given stimulation and three months later, five of the six patients stabilised or gained weight. After nine months, three patients were maintaining a higher weight than before the treatment started - the longest period of sustained weight gain any had achieved since their illness began. Around half of the patients also experienced improvements in their mood or reduced obsessive-compulsive behaviour. Researcher Dr Andres Lozano, a leading neurosurgeon in the field of DBS, said it appeared to have a genuine effect on the illness. ‘The finding of improvements in mood and anxiety in patients who were still underweight is especially striking, in view of the well known poor response of underweight patients to conventional pharmacotherapies or psychotherapies’ he added.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- I am the mother of three amazing children. Before having children, I was a firm believer that guns were dangerous. But I did nothing to educate myself about guns or gun safety. I feared the unknown and the danger guns seemed to possess. But after 10 years, I now have a gun in my home. Listening to President Obama's news conference on Thursday marking 100 days after Sandy Hook, and the whole gun control debate, prompted me to get my viewpoint across. I married a U.S. Marine. He of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms. This posed no issue until our son was born. I was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home, while he felt quite the opposite. We agreed on one gun locked in a safe, and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents.' Slowly over the years, I became more and more fearful of being home alone on the nights he worked, especially after I had children. We were living in Maryland on a farm in the middle of nowhere. One night, I got a call from my husband telling me to lock all doors and windows as he had just spoken with a sheriff down the road who was looking for an escaped convict. I was terrified. We had that one gun, but I had no idea how to use it. That changed very quickly over the following weeks, as we went out for target practice. I learned how to shoot and for the first time in years, I slept well. I finally felt safe at night. Over the 11 years of our marriage, I slowly learned about guns. I began to accept that the gun itself posed no danger -- any danger was in the hand and heart of the beholder. I learned there were safe ways to teach your children about guns. Guns were a tool like any tool; they have multiple purposes and uses. I learned more about our Constitution and our rights as U. S. citizens. I learned I had nothing to fear and a lot to gain from owning a gun. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? I think mothers need to educate themselves and learn how to best educate their kids. I work with a lot of other mothers, and many of them are shocked that I was taught how to shoot. I understand because I was there at one point -- I was scared of guns. But I no longer fear them. Marine to senator: I won't 'register my weapons' So Mr. Obama and your gun control advocates: I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from raping me or my daughters. I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from entering my home and doing what he may. However, my gun is very capable of stopping such a criminal if such an act were to occur. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . We live in a society where no one is there to protect us. The police come after the crime, not before. I do not have 24/7 armed protection like you do, Mr. President. Neither do my children. So until you can explain to this nation why your old city of Chicago has rising murder rates by guns, despite some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, I will continue to support the NRA, I will continue to urge others to support the Second Amendment and I will continue to vote for those politicians that support my views. I will also support the notion of placing armed police, veterans, etc. in our schools. Why should your children, Mr. President, be of the select few children in this country who are protected by armed guards? Why are your children more special than mine? Guns on campus: NRA to announce school safety measures . The fact is they are not. All children are special and have the right to be cared for and protected. I am a mom, and I am proud to support the NRA and my right to bear arms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tracy Scarpulla.",

A former German footballer has revealed how he gave up a promising career because he was too afraid to admit he is gay. As a young midfielder, Marcus Urban was seen as a rising star of the game when he played for the East German national youth team in the 1980s. But he was constantly terrified of being 'outed' as homosexual and decided not to pursue the profession any further. 'Painful': Marcus Urban said he felt unable to continue his career as a footballer because he felt under constant pressure to hide the fact he was gay . Urban described the experience of living a double life as 'unbearable'. 'I hid 24 hours a day, I . adjusted,' he told CNN. 'It was an almost unbearable pain, . a great sacrifice, a painful price to pay to achieve my goal of . becoming a professional footballer.' Urban began playing football in 1978, when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven before moving to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984. He trained twice a day with his new team and was being talked up as potential player for the German national team, winning a youth championship with Rot-Weiss in 1985. He was called up to East Germany's youth team in 1986 and played alongside or against . future German national team stars including Robert Enke, Bernd Schneider and . Thomas Linke. Marcus Urban played for the East German national youth team and was seen as a promising talent . Urban, far left, moved to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984, where he won a youth championship . Urban went on to make over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss' senior team in the German second division. But his spell in Erfurt proved to be the peak of a career cut short by fear and insecurity. 'By my early 20s I was burned out,' he said. 'I realized that if I became a professional footballer, I would suffer as a man. I chose freedom over a constructed prison. 'Talent is not enough. You need the will, physical fitness, good luck and a tough mentality. But what if you hide 24 hours a day because you are gay?' Urban finally told his story in the book 'Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban' - 'Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban'. The biography, written by Ronny Blaschke, is in the process of being turned into a feature film. In contrast, to many other sports, there are currently no openly gay footballers in British football leagues. But the tide is beginning to change and many believe it is only a matter of time before a player comes out. In February, former Leeds United winger Robbie Rogers became the first British professional footballer since Justin Fashanu in 1990 to reveal he is gay. Writing on his blog he revealed his sexuality but also announced his retirement from the game.

        "document": "(CNN) -- Barack Obama has talked of ripping out the White House bowling alley and replacing it with a basketball court. The former reserve player for Punahou High School's 1979 state championship team brings an enthusiasm for pickup basketball games to a place where golf, baseball and football have been the most-discussed sports. Reggie Miller says he'd pick Barack Obama for his squad because he likes the president-elect's team approach. And if he puts hoops in the White House, Reggie Miller, the retired basketball star and sports broadcaster, wants in. \"I would love to be the first to go there and play,\" said Miller, whose record-breaking 2,560 three-pointers with the Indiana Pacers electrified basketball fans. Today Miller, 43, is an NBA analyst for TNT, which is owned by Turner Broadcasting, parent company of CNN. Miller and others have said Obama's playing style yields clues to the type of president he will be. Miller, who said he backed Obama in the election, spoke Monday to CNN.com. iReport.com: What would you like to ask Obama? CNN: Do you know Barack Obama? Reggie Miller: I have never met him personally, but from afar, obviously I admire the man and the courage and the strength, the wisdom. I respect how much of a family man he is. CNN: Where does basketball fit in your view of Barack Obama? Miller: It seems like he has a regular pickup game, which I like because as a ballplayer, you like to do the same routine. ... He plays with the same guys, he likes to get a good sweat in. ... When you get a good workout in, you feel good for the rest of the day. It helps clear the mind. CNN: He's a left-hander; he likes to fake right and go to the left? Miller: I've seen clips of his Punahou [high school] days, when he played in Hawaii, and I saw that HBO special with Bryant Gumbel when they had that informal game. ... He is a point guard, and most point guards are right-handed, so it would be definitely be difficult to guard a point guard that was left-handed. And in that [HBO] clip, I loved his decision-making, because it looked like he tried to get everyone involved, until it was game point and it was tied up. Obviously, the commander in chief decides the game [Obama made the winning shot], and I like it. I think that trickles down into, you let your colonels, your generals do all the little work, but when it's time to make the big decision and win the game -- then it's the commander in chief, top dog, numero uno. But I will say this, if I was playing against him in a pickup game, I would definitely force him right because it looks like he loves to go left. CNN: Does he remind you of anyone you played against? Miller: Well, it's funny because you don't play against a lot of left-handed point guards. Greg Anthony of the Knicks, a left-handed point guard from UNLV. ... [Nate] \"Tiny\" Archibald, I believe he was left-handed as well. CNN: From what you've seen, how good a player is Obama? Miller: I would not mind picking him up on my squad; if there were 10 guys and we had to pick, he could definitely be in my squad. Because he knows what his strength is -- making sure that everyone gets involved, and that's the kind of point guard I want. Those are guys like Magic Johnson, Mark Jackson, John Stockton, it's not all about them; it's about let's make sure our team is good. He's going to get the ball to everyone. CNN: Speaking of being commander in chief, what are the lessons that you take away from Obama's basketball that you think would be useful? Miller: If you look at his demeanor, he's very cool; you have to be cool under pressure. You can't make hasty decisions. You've got to look at the full picture as a whole and then you assess it. And I think from a strategic and a political standpoint, I think that very much sums up Mr. Obama. You look at him during the debate and during the campaign, he pretty much never got too high and never got too low; he just kind of stayed right in the middle. When you're making the decisions that he's going to be making, for our economy, for Iraq, Afghanistan, you want someone who's levelheaded who's going to look at the big picture, who's going to rely on his Cabinet, which would be the other players. You want them to all be on same page, which you want your starting five to be, and then you go out there and execute it. CNN: You think he's going to have an impact on the sport of basketball by example? Miller: It's not just basketball, I think sports in general. You know he's already said yes, \"I think we should have a BCS\" [playoff system for deciding the nation's college football championship], and I think everyone agrees with him. I think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school, collegiate and professional ranks. ... For sports in general, it's good to have a person in the White House who's physically fit, who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country. CNN: In that order? Miller: I don't know about that order. I think I would probably start with running the country first. I think what we do is more entertainment and letting people escape. I think running the country is a little more important than worrying about the BCS title game. I think getting jobs is probably first and foremost and getting our economy straight and getting our troops home, I think those are the most important things for the president-elect. But if he does find time to get a BCS playoff, that would be nice.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- When Command Sgt. Maj. Michael T. Hall of the International Security Assistance Force announced that fast-food offerings like Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen and Orange Julius were being shuttered in Afghanistan, he was blunt about it. \"This is a warzone, not an amusement park,\" he wrote on the ISAF blog. These mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in Kandahar and Bagram, are \"nonessentials\" and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much-needed battlefield supplies. However, according to some soldiers and Marines -- all of whom have served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare isn't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought. The veterans and active-duty troops all said that access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters. The announcement of the fast-food outposts' shuttering inspired a lively debate on CNN's Afghanistan blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm's way. Those affected, however, didn't seem very concerned. \"The big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones,\" Marine Cpl. David Brian Crouch said. Especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet, sour, salty and spicy condiments, such as Tabasco, sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military's frequently derided Meals Ready to Eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities. These high-calorie MREs, which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures, are precisely what Crouch, who served two tours in Iraq, says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful, familiar fast food. Others look a little closer to their temporary home, sampling the local fare. While many soldiers out on combat patrols were, according to Army Capt. David Swaintek, \"too tired and drained to care much about their meal,\" he developed a taste for Iraqi flavors during his tour, which lasted from 2002 to 2008. While he stands up for food on base, calling it \"decent\" and \"healthier\" than fast-food alternatives, he still misses his favorite flatbread, which he'd buy while out on patrol, and he laments not being able to find anything like it stateside. Similarly adventurous, previously deployed Marines now at California's Camp Pendeleton don't have to venture far from their barracks to indulge in the Middle Eastern-style specialties they've come to love. According to the Marine Corps Times, DedeMed's Shawarma House now serves the eponymous gyro-like sandwich -- as well as hummus, tabbouleh salad and baklava -- to Marines who'd been stationed in Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Swaintek, while lauding the indigenous cuisine, also cried foul about fatty U.S. fast foods, saying that \"overweight soldiers are a problem.\" Army Sgt. Paul Williams, who is serving in Iraq, agrees with the captain but indulges in \"the occasional pizza from Pizza Hut, burrito from Taco Bell, or maybe even a sandwich from Subway,\" citing the virtue of being able to enjoy a pizza in the middle of the desert and escape for a few minutes to talk with fellow soldiers about their homes, sweethearts or future plans. Ultimately, though, the military is a culture of intense physical fitness, and access to nutritious meals at mess halls helps servicemen and women maintain their physical and psychological. edge. And Williams says that \"a soldier has a responsibility to maintain himself.\" While deployed troops can certainly take the reins of their physical health, friends and family stateside can still boost morale and offer a taste of home with much-appreciated care packages. The Department of Defense maintains a list of links to groups coordinating care packages for overseas soldiers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, most foods that are tightly prepackaged and immune to mold or bacterial growth are safe for sending to soldiers. They recommend dried proteins, like beef and turkey jerky, as well as dehydrated soups, dried fruits and even dense baked goods like fruitcakes. Just make sure to seal it all up with a kiss.",

        "document": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest. Researchers in Aberdeen think playing Wii Fit may improve the elderly's balance and lower risks of falling. The University of Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) have embarked on a four month study on people over 70 to observe any changes in balance after regular use of the Wii Fit. The video game has different activities including yoga poses, push ups, strength, balance and aerobic exercises. The Wii Fit includes a balance board that records movements and gives feedback on performance. Dr Marie Fraser, a specialist registrar at Woodend Hospital in Scotland, UK, is carrying out the research. She told CNN: \"Falls are the most common cause of accidental injury in older people and the most common cause of accidental deaths in 75-year-olds and over.\" It is hoped that using the Wii Fit's balance board can improve elderly people's balance and confidence. Dr Alison Stewart, who devised the study said she came up with the idea while working in the Osteoporosis department at the University of Aberdeen, after seeing a large number of fractures in old people who had fallen. Stewart, a commercial research manager with the NHS, said she then decided to research how to improve older people's balance. She told CNN: \"There exists a medical fitness device that improves balance, but it is expensive and I could not get the funding. \"That's when I looked up the Wii and discovered it is very similar to the other equipment, but less expensive. \"What is great about the Wii is it also has an entertainment value. The fact that it is enjoyable also makes the compliance rate higher.\" The latest study comes as another pilot study at Southern Cross University, Australia looked at the  benefits of using the Wii to help Parkinson's sufferers. A group of seven older people with and without the degenerative condition took part in the pilot project, and were put through an almost daily regime of playing the Nintendo Wii. Associate Professor Rick van der Zwan who led the research said initial results were \"positive.\" They ultimately hope to determine the effectiveness of computer games in developing muscle strength and co-ordination and reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson's. \"People generally start to develop the disease in their 50s or 60s. It leads to inertia and people become unstable on their feet,\" said Van der Zwan in a media statement. \"What we are trying to do is reduce the risk of serious harm. These people are nine times more likely to fall over than someone without the disease and falls in this older age group can be very serious.\" Van der Zwan now wants to recruit 15 more research participants to broaden the study. Since its launch in 2006 the Nintendo Wii has seen a huge rise in the number of elderly players. At one senior citizen home in north-east England, staff introduced the popular games console at Christmas in all five of its homes. \"Everyone loves it and we noticed it has improved the physical fitness of residents who play,\" Rachel Todd of McArdle Care told CNN. Todd believes the device's entertainment value not only improves residents' fitness levels, but also their mental fitness. Among the Wii Fit fans at the home are 74-year-old Ian Fisher and 86-year-old Betty Dennis. \"I always loved sports, particularly football\" Dennis told CNN. \"But I had a stroke six months ago and am now in a wheelchair.\" \"Since the Wii I really feel movement in my right arm has improved, which is all I need to play skittles.\" Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson. \"It really spans all ages, although my great-grandson knocked me out twice,\" the former bricklayer said.",

        "document": "By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 20:29 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 8 August 2013 . An 18-year-old student is suing her former school for allegedly not taking her claims of bullying seriously over a year and a half. Isabella Hankey, known as Belle, claims she went from being a happy student to suffering such anxiety over the death threats scratched into the wall of the school locker room, that she suffered a pulmonary embolism. Belle has filed a $2 million federal civil rights lawsuit against the towns of Concord and Carlisle, the . Concord-Carlisle school district, and three school administrators, . alleging that the school did nothing to stop the bullying, according to The Boston Globe. Bullied: Belle Hankey claims feces were smeared on her car and death threats were carved into the locker room wall . 'I hated walking in the halls, thinking . that you could be walking by the person that hates you. It’s terrifying. You think that it could . be your friends, a stranger, anyone,' she said. The bullying, by a still unknown person, began on Belle's 17th birthday, when she drove to school in a car her parents had bought her as a gift. She told Boston.com that when she finished class she returned to the parking lot to find three deep scratches on her car. A few months later, she found feces smeared on her car and, on another occasion, a vulgar word scratched into her bumper. 'I was in shock. It was disgusting. Who is physically capable of doing something so disgusting?' she said. Belle claimed that her school did nothing to investigate and, when her parents asked for cameras to be installed, they were told it would be too expensive. When she told the assistant principal about the slur carved into her car he allegedly told her, 'I don't know what you want me to do', according to Fox 25. The bullying soon took a more sinister turn, when she found the words 'Kill Belle' scratched into the locker room wall in June last year. Days later, the teenager found another threat carved into the wall that read: 'Belle's dead at 9:15'. Ordeal: The Concord schoolgirl suffered anxiety after receiving death threats in school . Lawsuit: Concord school district is being sued for $2 million by the 18-year-old . When she saw the first death threat, Belle said she was so scared she sat crouched in the toilet stall and was too scared to move. By October the anxiety led to Belle suffering a pulmonary embolism, which doctors said had been caused by stress. Her parents claim their phone calls and e-mails to the school were often not returned. They became so concerned for their daughter's safety that they hired a private investigator and fitted cameras in their daughter’s car. The police were contacted, but they told the parents the school was the best place to deal with the bullying. Belle's mother, Debra Hankey, said: 'She needs to know why this wasn't taken care of. She needs to know why they let her down, why they didn't protect her.' At the time, names of several people who could be behind the threats were put forward, including a group of girls known as the 'Sexy Seven'. However, it is claimed nothing was done to follow up the leads. 'It’s been two years this fall and it’s . unbelievable that no one knows,' she told the Boston Globe. 'When the death threats started . happening, I saw girls going into the office all the time saying, \"I . don’t know if I feel safe in here\".' Belle became so anxious at school that she completed her classes at Rivers and Revolutions, a progam that allowed her to study in a building away from the main school. Even then, the harassment continued. Just before returning after the summer, she found the word 'Ready' carved into her car's bumper. In response to the lawsuit, . Concord-Carlisle High School Principal Peter Badalament said in a . statement: '[The] school district cannot comment on a complaint which it . has not even seen'. He added that the school took bullying seriously. Ordeal: Belle claims the school did not do enough to find the person responsible for the bullying . Concord Schools deputy superintendent John Flaherty told Fox 25: 'We take the issue of harassment very seriously ... the district is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all of our students. Beyond that we have no comments at this time.' The 18-year-old, who plans to study at the University of Mississippi, said the suit was a way to try to prevent others suffering from the same experience. 'I’m definitely still carrying it with me. Hopefully this will help me have some closure on it,' she said.",

        "document": "It was the single most deadly day on the world's highest peak - 16 Sherpa guides were killed on Mount Everest when an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall on April 18. On that morning, just before 7am, mountaineer Joby Ogwyn was lying his tent 17,598 ft up the iconic peak at Base Camp when the unnerving, but a familiar sound of 'creaking and groaning' caused him to stick his head out and what he saw will haunt him forever. 'Within a couple of seconds it looked like this big white dragon, thunderously loud, moving at probably 200 miles an hour, straight toward our Sherpa, who were carrying some of our equipment up to a higher camp.' Scroll down for videos . Power: The aftermath of the avalanche that came down Mount Everest on April 18 that claimed the lives of 16 Sherpas . Deadly: The avalanche struck at the Khumbu Icefall, a treacherous passage between Base Camp and Camp 1 riddled with crevasses and columns of ice known as seracs . Ogwyn, 39, who was preparing to climb Everest and then become the first man to leap off the 29,029-foot summit in a wing suit for the Discovery Channel, watched as blocks of ice the size of cars and houses crashed down the slopes. Out of the 16 Sherpa's who died that day, three were working for Ogwyn and instead of a triumphant piece of television, the Discovery Channel crew found themselves witness to a dramatic rescue and recovery mission in the moments that followed. Aired on Sunday night, the revised special, Everest Avalanche Tragedy, showed harrowing footage from the scene, including the heart-breaking moment rescuers discovered the leg of Sherpa, Dorjee Khatri, poking out the huge icy fall. 'I looked outside and saw the avalanche coming down,' Ogwyn recalled according to the LA Times. 'Everyone got wiped out that I could see.' Rush to help: Cameras from the Discovery production crew witness the frantic attempts to reach those affected by the avalanche . Ice blocks the size of houses: The avalanche's power is appreciated when the helpless mountaineers are seen in comparison with the displaced ice . Despite not being in the deadly path, Ogwyn knew then and there that his wing suit adventure would not happen. 'We were just doing all we could do to find our guys and get their dead bodies off the mountain,' he said. 'We were trying to reach our guys by radio, but we couldn't get anyone on the radio,' an emotional Ogwyn recalled to the LA Times. 'Within an hour we knew they were dead. They'd found some pieces of equipment that had literally gotten blown off the guys. Boots and backpacks.' At Base Camp, Ogwyn and the Discovery Channel production crew were around a half-mile from the avalanche and they instantly tried to contact his Sherpa guide team. When they received no response, they immediately feared the worst. Emotional: Joby Ogwyn watched the avalanche from his tent as it began to tumble down the slopes of Mount Everest on April 18 . Recovery: Joby Ogwyn said that it dawned on everyone very quickly that this would not be a rescue mission . The powerful and emotional Discovery special revealed the moment that one survivor was found buried waist deep, battered and bloody from ice as heavy as blocks of concrete. Others were simply entombed in the ice. 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' Ogwyn said to zap2it.com. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Ogwyn rushed towards the disaster zone and because of his peak physical fitness was able to make the climb in only one hour - for others it would have taken much longer. 'I knew this was going to be bad,' he said, admitting he knew this was a recovery mission, not a rescue. In tears during the Discovery special, Ogwyn explained how he saw a helicopter airlift the tragic dead away from the scene wrapped in sleeping bags or tents. Harrowing: The leg of Dorjee Khatri is visible in this tragic grab from Discovery's Everest Avalanche Tragedy which aired on Sunday evening . So sad: Bodies were airlifted away from the disaster zone wrapped in sleeping bags or tents . 'I sat there and watched the whole thing,' he said to Zap2It.com. 'They found body after body.' There were three Sherpas working for Ogwyn Discovery and Peacock Productions - Dorjee Khatri, Dorjee Sherpa and Phur Temba Sherpa —  but the mountaineer knew all 16. Respecting their reputation as the world's greatest climbers, Ogwyn specially requested those three to help carry the heavy filming equipment. 'I knew they would appreciate what I was trying to do,' he said. During his two decades climbing the world's tallest peaks, Ogwyn had witnessed many avalanches, but nothing like this. On Everest, everything is bigger and when a glacier breaks, 'it buries people like concrete buries the,.' 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' said Ogwyn. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Confirmation: The documentary from Discovery showed how the disaster unfolded in real time and how the production team who were there for a wing suit record attempt quickly found themselves organizing a recovery mission . During the course of the Discovery special, the build up to the moment of the avalanche was replayed, including interviews with Ogwyn, expedition leader Garrett Madison and additional members of the expedition and production teams. 'It's heartbreaking,' said a still-shaken Ogwyn. 'I've been climbing in the Himalayas for the past 15 years and forged a friendship with a lot of these guys. I'm shell-shocked by this. Everyone is.' The network also announced they are to donate to the American Himalayan Foundation Sherpa Family Fund, which helps the families of the deceased. Ogwyn is still reeling from the accident and told Reuters that the, 'Hardest job in the world to go rescue your dead buddies off that mountain and that’s exactly what everybody came together to do that that day. Highest peak on Earth: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable . Khumbu Icefall: More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Everest's summit since it was first climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. The route they took along the South Col was the one hit by the avalanche . Star of the show: The Discovery Channel live jump was going to be done by Joby Ogwyn, an experienced wingsuiter, and the special was announced in February . 'So it’s a really powerful story and it needs to be told. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to watch it. My heart’s broken and I’ll never, ever get over it.' However, while his attempt to jump off Everest in his specially designed wing suit has been postponed, he is now focusing on helping the families of the dead Sherpas. 'I think what people don't realize is how much the Sherpas enjoy their jobs,' he said. 'They are far from slaves.' 'My goal went from climbing and jumping off the mountain to raising money for the families,' Ogwyn said. He wants those willing to donate money to visit The Sherpa Family Fund, where 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the victims families. 'We were at Mt. Everest to make history, but instead we were there as eyewitnesses to history,' said Eileen O'Neill, Group President, Discovery, Science and Velocity Networks. Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . No hope of survival: Rescuers on Mount Everest found the body of a 13th Nepalese guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak . Indeed, in the aftermath of the disaster, the Sherpas have refused to climb, citing poor conditions and a lack of respect from the Nepal Government, who make millions each year from climbing permits. Conversely, when a Sherpa dies their family receives $400. 'I think it's their right to,' said Ogwyn of the Sherpas' strike. 'It's very fresh in their minds... But life goes on. It's going to be pretty hard for a lot of guys to make a living if they don't want to work, including myself. 'I don't want to find something else to do and I think a lot of Sherpas in that region take a lot of pride in what they do. 'Everybody, Western people and Sherpa, needed to take some time to let this sink in and go away a little bit before we start planning the next season on Everest.' Nepalese mountain rescue workers lifting an injured climber after an avalanche came down on Mt. Everest. Authorities called off the rescue operation for survivors after 13 Nepali climbing guides were killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest, as bad weather closed in . Final resting place: Group of family members of the  Nepalese mountaineer carry the body of Ang Kaji Sherpa, who died on Mt. Everest Avalanche upon its arrival   at Sherpa Monastry in Kathmandu . On Wednesday, family members, mountaineers and government officials gathered in Nepal's capital Wednesday for a memorial service for the 16 Nepalese Sherpa guides killed in avalanche on Mount Everest. They offered flower garlands and lit candles and incense in front of the photographs of the 16 Sherpa guides who died in the April 18 avalanche. The 13th day after death is the customary end of mourning and the day when Nepalis generally hold memorials. 'We are still disappointed at the government, which has done little for the family members. The help they have given is a joke, like giving money to a beggar. The state should take care of the families of the dead,' said Pasang Doma, who lost her brother in the avalanche. While 13 bodies have been recovered, the three others are buried under heavy snow and ice. Most of the expedition teams have left the mountain while the rest are packing their bags and gear in the base camp. The avalanche was the deadliest disaster on the world's highest mountain. It was triggered when a massive piece of glacier sheared away from the mountain along a treacherous section of constantly shifting ice and crevasses known as the Khumbu Icefall, marked by overhanging ice as big as office buildings.",

        "document": "By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . We might not be quite ready to send humans to Mars, but that hasn’t stopped some bright minds coming up with ideas for what people might live in when they arrive. In a competition for Nasa called the 'Mars Base Challenge', innovators were tasked with designing living space for future astronauts. The winning design is one that intends to give explorers two bedrooms, two bathrooms and other six-sided rooms in a ‘honeycomb’ shape. Michigan-based designer has won a competition to design a home for future astronauts to live in on Mars with his 'Queen B' 3D printed design for a contest run by Nasa and Makerbot . In May this year Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan outlined the space agency's plans for Mars. In a series of talks across the UK she said we'll be there by the 2030s. But she explained there are key developments that must be made first . These include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components . This will ensure the first Mars-walkers survive a return trip to the red planet, she said. The competition was carried out by Nasa in alongside 3D-printing company MakerBot. It took place on Thingiverse, a website where people can share their designs for 3D printers. Contestants were tasked with designing their own abode using a 3D printer that future astronauts might one day live inside. The winning design was by Noah Hornberg from Michigan. Nasa asked entrants to design houses that could tackle Mars’ extremely cold temperature, high radiation levels, lack of oxygen and frequent dust storms. ‘My solution is to use the tessellating hexagon due to its compactness and modular potential,’ Mr Hornberg wrote in his entry. Mr Hornberg's design includes different rooms for people to use such as bedrooms and even a garden . Mr Hornberg says he chose the hexagon shape because it was less likely to break over time than squares . The hexagonal shape also allowed a number of amenities to be fitted into the separate rooms . Most of the time, Mars is clear, dry, cold, and clear. Clouds are very small, wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice. It never rains on Mars because of the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield, the the one that cover Earth. Temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20°C. But at night, temperatures can drop to -90°C. This dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks. The maximum wind speeds on Mars recorded by the Viking Landers in the 1970's were about 30 meters per second (60 mph) with an average of 10 m/s (20 mph). ‘I have extrapolated on the idea of a fully functional apartment on Mars with all the modern amenities fit inside 16ft (5 metre) diameter hexagons. 'I think that to present Mars life to people and actually make it appealing to the public, it needs to feel like home and reflect the lifestyle trends of Earth living.’ He says his design, without any appendages sticking out, would be more practical for long-term living. And a hexagonal shape would also be less likely to distort or rupture under pressure than other shapes, such as a square. To stay warm, meanwhile, a large subterranean container would hold water to be heated in an underground electric heater. This would keep the bottom of the house heated, while the creation of steam would allow for steam-powered generators for energy.

In total the competition had 228 submissions, with first place winning a MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3D printer. Second place went to the Martian Pyramid from user Valcrow, who favoured the triangular shape. Their home was designed around sustainability and had a closed aquaponics system to grow food. The Mars Acropolis meanwhile, from project and design engineer Chris Starr, was a more complicated design that would have three greenhouses, a water tower to collect vapour from the atmosphere and even a runway.

        "document": "London (CNN) -- A British spy found dead at his home in 2010 -- his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub -- was either suffocated or poisoned, but it is unlikely his death will ever be satisfactorily explained, coroner Fiona Wilcox said Wednesday. Gareth Williams' death was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated,\" she ruled. He probably entered the bag alive, Wilcox said, reading her ruling to a court around the corner from the home of the world's most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. But she was sure an unknown person put the bag containing his body into the bath and probably locked it, she said. The case has gripped the British public for more than a year and a half, since Williams, an MI6 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent, was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. But after a weeklong inquest at which evidence from hundreds of expert witnesses, security camera images and police interviews was presented, the \"most fundamental questions as to how Gareth died remain unanswered,\" Wilcox said Wednesday. There was \"endless speculation but little real evidence,\" she said. And in unusual criticism of the Secret Intelligence Service, as MI6 is formally known, she said a delay in reporting his death and in providing relevant evidence added to the uncertainties about the case. Some of that evidence came to her only in the last 48 hours of the inquiry, Wilcox said. The coroner appeared briefly overcome with emotion as she came to the end of reading her ruling, her voice faltering as she announced her findings. The cause of death remains unknown, but experts agreed it was either from suffocation or poisoning, she said. \"I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully,\" she concluded. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong, neither of which was supported by the evidence, the coroner said. She also cast doubt on suggestions that he was into bondage or transvestism, fueled by the discovery of women's clothes, wigs and cosmetics in his apartment, saying she thought Williams bought them out of an interest in fashion, rather than any sexual motivation. Expressing her sympathies to his family, Wilcox said the inquest could not bring him back, but she hoped it had at least allowed them to see the evidence out in the open. A lawyer for Williams' family said that losing a much-loved son and brother would have been a tragedy in any circumstances but that the nature of Williams' death had made it all the worse. \"Our grief is exacerbated by the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even the most basic inquiries as to his whereabouts and welfare, which any reasonable employer would have taken,\" he said. \"We are also extremely disappointed at the reluctance and failure of MI6 to make available relevant information.\" The family has called for the Metropolitan Police to review the role of the intelligence services in the investigation. MI6 head John Sawers apologized \"unreservedly\" to Williams' family for the service's failure to act more swiftly and said measures have been put in place to make sure it doesn't happen again. The detective leading the police investigation, Jackie Sebire, said new lines of inquiry had resulted from the inquest and would now be \"actively pursued.\" \"His naked body was found in the most suspicious of circumstances,\" Sebire said. \"It is highly likely that a third party was involved in Gareth's death, and I urge anyone who knew Gareth or who had contact with him to search their conscience and come forward with any information about what happened that night.\" Inside the court, a picture emerged of a man who had few friends but was very close to his family, highly intelligent and physically fit thanks to his love of cycling. A math prodigy who had completed his mathematics degree and master's by the age of 21, he was someone who relished a challenge and had received an award for his \"world-class\" work for the intelligence services. Summing up the evidence, Wilcox said it was \"extremely unlikely,\" but not impossible, that Williams had worked out a technique to get into the bag -- measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches (81 by 48 centimeters) -- and lock it from the inside. But, she said, there was no evidence of footprints or handprints on the walls of the bathroom or the bath itself, as might have been expected if he had done that. He was not a risk taker, she said, and that made it unlikely in her view that he would have put himself into the bag even as a personal challenge without making sure he could get out. Of the four keys belonging to the padlock that secured the bag in which Williams was found, one pair was found inside it with him. A second pair was found on a key ring in his apartment, Wilcox said. There was no sign that evidence had been tampered with, such as traces of bleach. There was also no sign of a break-in or robbery in his neat, tidy apartment, she said. She described his body as \"peaceful\" and said there was no indication of a struggle. Wilcox also said there were no indications that Williams was feeling suicidal. However, tests that might have revealed unusual or volatile poisons were ruled out by the decomposition of the body. Traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug GHB were found, but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process, she said. British media have reported that Williams' Internet history showed an interest in sex games and bondage, but Wilcox said the codebreaker had made only a handful of visits to bondage sites. The coroner said there was no evidence of interest in claustrophilia, a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces. His apartment contained 20,000 pounds ($32,000) worth of high-fashion women's clothing, unworn and packed as purchased, Wilcox said, but she said she found no connection between his death and his interest in fashion and women's shoes and clothing. There also was no indication that his death was connected to his work, she said. He had not taken on any high-risk operations, and he worked only in the UK. There was no evidence of threats arising to him from his work, his employers testified. Wilcox was highly critical of Williams' line manager, who did not report that he was missing for about a week after he died August 16. She said the inability of the manager to recall certain key bits of evidence concerning the week of Williams' death \"is beginning to stretch the bounds of credibility.\" When questioned, the manager said he assumed Williams was absent for a legitimate reason that he had forgotten about, even though he missed several meetings. They worked on a small team of four people. The manager and other SIS employees testified from behind a screen and were identified only as SIS, plus a letter. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. \"I can only speculate as to what effect this had on this investigation,\" Wilcox said. The decomposition of Williams' body was hastened by the fact it was in a top floor apartment, where the temperature soared in the summer heat. The heating was mysteriously also turned on, despite it being a hot August, she said. Police did not secure the scene until eight or nine days after Williams died. Reports about the \"body-in-a-bag spy\" describe how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video provided to the court shows one of them, Peter Faulding, folding himself laboriously into an identical bag placed in a bathtub. Faulding, who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces, told the inquest that he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success. A second expert witness, also of a size and build similar to Williams, tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding. Neither ruled out definitively the possibility that Williams could have somehow done it alone. But a small trace of someone else's DNA was found on the bag, helping spawn all kinds of theories about who else might have been there. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6. The nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death. Concerns about national security have been a factor in the 20-month delay in holding Williams' inquest, and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices. A series of photographs provided by the Metropolitan Police show the tidy, impersonal interior of the spy's Pimlico home and the small white-tiled bathroom where his body was found. A bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to Williams' passion for cycling. A glimpse through a bedroom door shows a bed half-made, clothes lying on it. But little else can be gleaned from the images. The Metropolitan Police says it is continuing its investigation, particularly in light of the coroner's findings and the concerns raised by his family. But for now, the identity of the unknown person who apparently put the bag holding Williams into the bath, exactly how he died and the reason why, remain as much a mystery as ever. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.",

        "document": "By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 03:39 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:28 EST, 2 August 2013 . Sporty Spice Melanie Chisholm is living up to her nickname by this year taking on a number of fitness challenges. She's already competed in the five mile National Lottery Anniversary Run and the Virgin London Triathlon and now she's preparing for her biggest endurance feat yet - the Great North Run. The singer, 39, will take part in the half marathon in October with a team of runners raising money for the charity Shelter. As well as completing the gruelling 13.1 mile distance, their challenge will be to beat former GB 400m athlete Iwan Thomas, who will be raising money with his team for Macmillian Cancer Support at the Great South Run in October. Sporty Spice: So far this year Mel C has competed in the five mile National Lottery Anniversary Run, left, and the Virgin London Triathlon . As October's Great South Run in Portsmouth is a shorter distance than the North East half marathon at 10 miles, the competition is based on which team raises the most money and not on who runs the fastest. But that hasn't stopped the pair getting competitive. 'Mel is pretty fit at the moment but I think I could beat her over a half marathon,' Iwan, 39, told MailOnline. 'I guess I have a bit of an edge being an ex-professional athlete as you . always have that mental strength, so when it starts to hurt, you know how . to push yourself through that pain barrier.' The race is on: Mel and Iwan will compete to see whose team can raise the most money for charity . Mel C said she has been running three times as week as well as doing gym workouts, swims and bike rides. But she intends to step her running training up over the summer so she can complete the half marathon - with an aim of finishing in under two hours. She admitted she is slightly daunted by the distance: 'It will be the furthest I’ve run in my whole life. I have been having lots of fun in the triathlon and enjoying the different disciplines of the swim, bike and run but I have never done long distances,' she said. 'I have always wanted to do a half marathon but I am putting myself in the deep end with the Great North as it’s the biggest half in the world, everyone knows about it and it’s not an easy course, it’s quite undulating. Iwan’s told me it’s really hard but I’m not sure if he’s just psyching me out!' Mel said she is enjoying the running training as it gives her some 'me' time as she juggles her singing career - she has a single out with Matt Cardle and will go on tour again later this year with Jesus Christ Superstar - alongside being a parent to daughter, Scarlet, four. Catch me if you can: Mel has been training hard and hopes to finish the half marathon in under two hours . She said: 'It can be tricky and that’s what stops me training as much as I would like. My daughter is my priority but I have when she is at school to train. 'Like everyone I just have to try and fit it in. I’m lucky in the respect that I don’t have a 9 to 5 job so sometimes I will have a morning or afternoon free.' Mel, who has been open about her battle with eating disorders in the past, said she now prefers to stay in shape by exercising and eating healthily. She said: 'When you are exercising you can . be more relaxed about your diet. When you are in the public eye there is . a lot of pressure to stay slim and look a certain way but if you are . active and eating well then most of the time it takes care of itself. 'I'd say to young girls it’s always better to exercise and eat healthily . than diet. There are no quick fixes, diets really don’t work. 'There are . times when I was younger when I have gone with the trends and tried . different diets. I did a low carb one once but that made me feel awful . because I am so active.' Benefits: The singer said she loves running as it clears her head and keeps her physically healthy . She admitted she is currently stocking up on carbs to get her through her half marathon training. 'It’s just a case of making sure you have . enough fuel when you are demanding more of your body. So I am having . more carbs for energy. I also have to make sure I eat regularly and . never leave long gaps so I always have something in the tank,' she said. She revealed she did try the Alkaline Diet earlier this year - beloved by her fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham - but she can't sustain it long term. She said: 'I have done the Alkaline Diet before we . went on tour with Jesus Christ Superstar. I’m really into eating to . benefit what you were doing and it was recommended to me so I tried it. I . enjoyed it and it gave me a lot of energy. 'It’s basically vegetarian . and involves taking acid out of your diet, so no meats or processed . foods. It’s the things we know anyway about not eating things that are . bad for you and sticking to whole grains, soya and pulses. But it’s hard . to stick to when barbecue season hits as I do like a burger!' Mel added that her exercise regime means she can find it difficult to find clothes to fit her toned arms - 'but then I just get the guns out!' she joked. If the Great North goes well she said she would be tempted to do double the distance at next year's London Marathon. ompetitive: Iwan and Mel are good friends as well as rivals . It's a race Iwan knows well as he's raced it numerous times with a pb time of 3 hours and 58 minutes. He said the transition from sprinter to long distance runner wasn't easy. 'Every year I do the London Marathon and . people overtaking me saying, \"what are you doing, you should be faster . than this!\" But it’s completely different,' he explained. 'It’s a different pain to what I was used . to. Racing over 400m you get lactic acid and have to dig deep and then . you may feel sick for ten minutes afterwards if it was a hard race. But . the marathon, the first year I did it I couldn’t walk down the stairs . until the Thursday after! It's the toughest thing I have ever done.' Iwan was also keen to set the record straight about a recent triathlon at Blenheim where it was reported he 'nearly drowned' when he pulled out of the swim. 'It's the toughest thing I've ever done': Iwan said swapping 400m running for marathon training hasn't been easy . He said: 'I hadn’t done a triathlon for a couple . of years and I got in the water and had a bit of a panic attack. I . wasn't breathing properly so waved to the rescue boat to get a lift . home. It wasn't as bad as it was reported, I didn't nearly drown. 'It . hasn’t put me off triathlons though, they are such great fun. I was furious with myself afterwards for not . finishing.' Iwan added that he's delighted more people are getting into sport after the London 2012 Olympics and that Brits have been coming out top this year in everything from the Tour de France to Wimbledon. But he said he's disappointed drugs scandals has been overshadowing clean performances in athletics. He said: 'When I heard about Tyson Gay and Asafa . Powell I was really angry and disappointed for the sport. 'It is a good . thing we are catching the cheats out but the danger is people . tarnish all athletes with the same brush. People might be put off the . sport because they think the very best are on drugs but that’s not the . case. It’s just a handful of idiots who see the benefits of being the . best in the world and take short cuts to get there.' MEL'S TIPS . IWAN'S TIPS .

        "document": "By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 4 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:27 EST, 5 November 2012 . The time it takes to diagnose dementia is to be slashed from 18 months to just three following a scientific breakthrough. David Cameron will this week announce the creation of a chain of brain clinics to end the agony of those who find out they have Alzheimer’s when it is too late for help. Experts say early diagnosis will give those suffering from the early stages of dementia 18 months of extra independent living, transforming the lives of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and elderly. Needing treatment: Thousands of dementia sufferers go without care because their condition goes undiagnosed . More than 400,000 people in Britain are suffering from dementia but are denied the care and support they need because their condition is undiagnosed – in part because they have to wait a year and a half for it to be confirmed. But new technology, which will receive the Prime Minister’s backing this Thursday, will mean those suffering from memory loss or other potential symptoms will have their condition diagnosed in a sixth of the time. Vow: Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged to preserve pensioners' benefits for the lifetime of this parliament . Patients at risk will be able to do a series of tests on an iPad in the comfort of their local GP’s office. In only ten minutes the software can determine the difference between people with normal and abnormal memory. Those at risk would then be referred to an NHS brain health centre where they would have more extensive memory tests while hooked up to an MRI scanner. A new computer program can detect signs of dementia such as brain shrinkage and damage to blood vessels that can affect memory. The results would be beamed back to the GP. The Government is also investing in a . series of mobile diagnostic clinics which will park outside GP . surgeries, so people can be tested on their own doorstep. The rate of successful diagnosis is . expected to double from 42 per cent at present to 80 per cent – a target . set by Mr Cameron earlier this year when he launched a Challenge on . Dementia. The PM has pledged to launch a campaign against Alzheimer’s to match the war on Aids in the 1980s and 1990s. It is estimated that by 2020 there will be nearly one million people with dementia, rising from the current level of 670,000. Mr Cameron said last night: ‘Dementia is a devastating disease that puts enormous strain on people and their families. Early intervention: Six out of ten people living with dementia in the UK currently have not received a diagnosis, research found. (Posed by model) ‘Prompt . diagnosis makes an enormous difference to dementia sufferers. This . ground-breaking work from UK scientists and companies could change lives . for the better and it underlines to the world that Britain is great for . research and for business.’ The . Government is investing £39million in the pilot project via a fund . called Biomedical Catalyst that backs small and medium-sized businesses . and universities to accelerate the development of most . technologically-advanced healthcare. The first ‘Brain Health Centre’ will . be established at the Memory Clinic at Maudsley Hospital in South . London. The mobile van will run trials in Sussex. If they are a success . they will be rolled out nationwide. The . Alzheimer’s Society will support the project by ensuring the needs of . patients and their carers are fully considered in the project, and by . undertaking an initial impact assessment on the 200 patients assessed in . the two trial Brain Health Centres. Six . out of ten people living with dementia in the UK have not received a . diagnosis. Experts say the problem is that many people have never raised . the problem with their GP, or may have been misdiagnosed, or are simply . waiting for a diagnosis. The current way a patient is diagnosed with dementia is both unwieldy and lengthy. In fact, there is no set referral pathway for those who complain about memory problems to their GP. A doctor may ask the patient to come back in a few months, may put the problem down to old age, or may conduct a basic pencil and paper memory test. Eventually a patient may be referred to a memory clinic, where other GPs will identify whether a problem exists. At that point the patient may be diagnosed, may be sent for a brain scan, or may be referred to a psychiatrist or neurologist in a regional centre. Guidelines mean patients should not wait more than 18 weeks for an appointment with a specialist, but high demand means it often takes much longer. Once they have an appointment at a hospital – usually in a major city or specialist hospital – they could have to travel long distances to get there. Usually the patient will then be given a memory test, and may, but not always, have an MRI or CT scan. The test is assessed by a neurologist or a psychiatrist. Any brain scans are assessed by a radiologist, who uses their expertise to judge whether there is a problem. At that point the patient may get a diagnosis. The whole process from start to finish can take up to 18 months. Under the proposed system, any patient with memory problems will be given a ten-minute test by a GP, using newly developed software on an iPad. It will immediately identify whether a patient is at risk of dementia. They hope the proposed system will make diagnoses quicker and more accurate – and the ease and access to scanners will mean people are not put off seeking help. The Alzheimer’s Disease International . charity says earlier diagnosis allows those with dementia to plan ahead . while they still have the capacity, and crucially, make decisions about . their own care. Early . interventions can also allow doctors to improve cognitive function, . treat depression and delay institutionalisation – giving a patient more . time to live independently. High . blood pressure and a lack of exercise have also been linked to the . onset of the dementia, and researchers are investigating whether early . changes to lifestyle may slow the progression of the disease. Jeremy . Hughes, chief executive at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘There are . 800,000 people living with dementia in the UK, but fewer than half of . people with the condition have a diagnosis. As numbers double and costs . soar, developing new and earlier ways of diagnosing the condition is . imperative. ‘This . technology could potentially reduce the time people need to wait for a . diagnosis significantly. After diagnosis, we also need to ensure that . people are supported with information and services to enable them to . gain the full benefits and support that a diagnosis can give.’ Professor Alistair Burns, the national . clinical director for dementia, said: ‘Combining innovative . technologies in this way should help us to spot early signs of dementia, . giving us time to offer patients better support and care.’ The . project is being run by the companies IXICO and Cambridge Cognition, . which developed the iPad software, in partnership with King’s College . London, the Universities of Brighton and Sussex and Imperial College London.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- The holidays are a time of reflection and often a time of charity, even for some of Hollywood's biggest stars. CNN's Alina Cho is taking a special look at how three celebrities are doing their part for causes near to their hearts in this year's \"Big Stars, Big Giving,\" which is scheduled to air 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET December 26-28 on CNN. Matt Damon . Water.org . Academy Award winner Matt Damon is using his star power to lead the way for change and bring clean water to those who do not have access to such a basic staple. \"Every 20 seconds, a kid under the age of 5 is dying, losing their life because they do not have access to clean water. And it just doesn't have to be that way,\" Damon tells CNN. Damon and water expert Gary White founded water.org in 2009 with a plan for what Damon says is a solvable problem. Close to a billion people do not have an affordable solution to clean drinking water, and the problem is twofold. \"To me, the most disturbing thing, not only is it contaminated, but people are walking hours to get this kind of water, \" Damon said in an interview with Impact Your World a few years ago, \"So, you're forced to give your children this water knowing that the chances of them getting a water-borne disease is pretty high.\" Damon and White say that charity is not enough and have created the concept of \"water credit,\" which allows people access to affordable loans to buy a toilet or a faucet to bring clean running water into their homes. And it's working. White says that loans are being paid back at a rate of 98% in places such as Haiti. Matthew McConaughey . J.K. Livin Foundation . Actor Matthew McConaughey and his wife, Camila, have made bettering the lives of young adults their mission. They founded the Just Keep Livin, or the J.K. Livin Foundation, to empower high school students \"to lead active lives and make healthy choices to become great men and women,\" as their mission states. \"I want to find a place where I can help out where it's prevention before you need a cure,\" McConaughey tells CNN. McConaughey has so far brought the J.K. Livin Foundation into 14 schools without after-school programs and where 75% of the students are on a free or reduced lunch program and below the poverty line. They are students who come from families who might not have the means to provide healthy meals or access to gyms. The J.K. Livin Foundation gives the students a safe place to be after school and the tools they need to grow into healthy adults. The program meets twice a week for two hours a day and is voluntary. The students who choose to attend participate in physical fitness, nutrition education and a gratitude circle. \"Everyone goes around and says something that they are thankful for. And that's a lesson that came from my mother and the family I grew up in. I found that the more you find something to be thankful for, the more you end up having things to be thankful for, and so it goes well beyond the gym,\" says McConaughey. Eva Longoria . The Eva Longoria Foundation . In addition to establishing herself as one of Hollywood's leading ladies, Eva Longoria has also made a name for herself campaigning for social issues. She's lent her voice to raise awareness of the AIDS crisis in Africa and sex trafficking in Thailand. When she decided she wanted to create her own foundation in 2010, she decided on a cause that hit much closer to home for her. The Eva Longoria Foundation aims to help Hispanic women get a college education. Some 27% of Latinas live below the poverty line, and 17% drop out of high school. Only 15% of adult Latinas have college degrees. Longoria hopes to empower women and change those statistics. \"I come from a family of teachers. I wasn't the first to go to college. It was expected, and that's rare in a lot of low-income families and a lot of minority families,\" says Longoria. Longoria's foundation supports other programs that help Hispanic women excel in their education, and it aims to provide Latina entrepreneurs with career training, mentorship, capital and opportunity. \"I don't want the Latino community to just be a large community. We need to be an educated community because this is going to be our future work force,\" says Longoria.",

        "document": "By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:35 EST, 1 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 2 December 2013 . Record numbers of anorexia sufferers - some aged just nine - are being admitted to hospital, according to shocking figures. File picture . Record numbers of anorexia sufferers – some aged just nine – are being admitted to hospital, according to shocking figures. Every night, 350 hospital beds across England on average are taken up by a patient desperately ill with anorexia, bulimia or another eating disorder. The figures have doubled in a decade. Last year, 15 children aged only between five and nine were admitted to hospital with eating disorders, underlining fears that unhealthy obsessions with food are developing very early. There is also growing concern that the NHS is worsening the crisis by refusing to treat patients because they are not deemed thin enough. Many clinics turn patients away until they fall below a certain body weight. One young woman told this when she appealed for help condemned it as a ‘perverse incentive’ to lose weight. The figures come after the NHS was heavily criticised in a report by the Patients Association. It revealed how a gifted 19-year-old died  following failings by GPs, hospital doctors and psychologists. Averil Hart was meant to have weekly check-ups but was allowed to become so thin that she slurred her words and was later found  collapsed in her student flat. Patients with anorexia, bulimia or other eating disorders accounted for 122,150 bed nights in 2012/13. This is up from 100,550 in 2011/12, said the Health and Social Care Information Centre. In contrast, 51,878 bed days were taken up by such patients in 2002/3. A total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year, three-quarters with anorexia. The figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months. Girls aged 15 are by far the most likely to be taken to hospital, with 200 admitted last year. Charities said these figures are the ‘tip’ of the iceberg as they do not include thousands of sufferers battling eating disorders at home. Laura Willmott, who died from anorexia aged just 18. She weighed just 5st when she died . When she collapsed and died, former private schoolgirl Laura Willmott weighed barely 5st. The 18-year-old had fought anorexia for five years and was admitted to hospital when she was so thin that she could barely walk. But she was discharged 11 days later when doctors deemed her ‘physically fit’. They did not discuss their decision with her parents as she was over 18. Miss Willmott, who went to  Colston Girls School, Bristol, was taken by her mother to A&E in October 2011. After being discharged, she continued to starve herself at home and refused to see a GP. The teenager, who hoped to be a nurse, suffered cardiac arrest a month later and died of brain damage a week later. At her inquest in February this year, her mother Vickie Townsend said: ‘She became frailer and frailer. She was not strong enough to walk. To get around inside the house, she had to crawl. ‘It is impossible to describe the impact of Laura’s death on my family or explain our experience of Laura’s dreadful journey as a teenager with anorexia to her demise at 18. She was a wonderful daughter and a very talented and supremely caring human being.’ They also do not take into account patients at private clinics who have given up on the NHS due to the lengthy waiting times. Leanne Thorndyke, of the eating disorder charity BEAT, said:  ‘People often tell us that they were told their BMI (body mass index) was not low enough. ‘With most other illnesses, no-one would tell a patient to go away and come back when their problem was a lot worse. ‘Yet people with eating disorders are often made to become even more dangerously ill before getting the help they so desperately need. Eating disorders are serious  mental illnesses.’ This year, a survey of 500 patients by the charity found a quarter had waited at least six months for treatment while nearly one in ten had been waiting for more than a year. A total of 2,381 patients were admitted to hospital last year, three-quarters with anorexia. The figure is up from 2,287 in the previous 12 months. File picture . Kat Pugh, 24, of London, who has had anorexia since she was only 11, said: ‘I’m trying to get NHS treatment but I’m not deemed sick enough. It is like a perverse incentive scheme to get worse.’ Around 3 per cent of adults are thought to have an eating disorder but some estimates suggest it could be 6.5 per cent. Women make up 90 per cent of cases. A fifth of anorexia sufferers die from complications caused by starving themselves, including organ damage or heart failure. The proliferation of pro-anorexia websites has been blamed for the rise of eating disorders in the young, especially in girls. There are around 400 to 500 such sites where users swap tips on how to starve themselves and boast about how few calories they have consumed.",

        "document": "Hiking! Zip-lining! Rock climbing! About 30,000 Boy Scouts and 7,000 adults are out in the mountains of southern West Virginia for the National Scouts Jamboree -- and they all had to meet a body mass index cut-off. The Boy Scouts of America mandated that no one -- adult or child -- with a BMI of 40 or above could be accepted into the Jamboree, which is taking place July 15-24. This standard is not new; it was in place for the last jamboree as well, said Deron Smith, director of public relations for Boy Scouts of America. \"This policy is not meant to keep anyone out at all, and it's just to make sure that they're safe,\" Smith said. \"We offer thousands of summer camp experiences (that) do not have this requirement.\" The Boy Scouts' healthy living initiative has inspired children and adults alike to lose weight, Smith said. The association is encouraging people to live a healthy lifestyle. But that's not how some see it. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, a nonprofit organization, has come out against the Boy Scouts' BMI policy, saying that the organization \"believes that this decision promotes bias and negative attitudes and furthers the discrimination against boys of larger body size.\" The organization publicly demanded in a statement that the Boy Scouts \"reconsider their discriminatory practices and admit camp attendees NOT based on their physical fitness, NOT based on their body size, but based on their active status as a boy scout.\" Most who could not meet the BMI requirement chose not to apply, Smith said. The organization does not know the number of children impacted. The Boy Scouts have not received any reactions from parents on the BMI issue, he said. For prospective participants who have a slightly lower BMI than 40, but are still obese, there are also special requirements for the jamboree, according to the Boy Scouts' website. The jamboree's medical staff needs a health history, health data and a recommendation from a personal health care provider for children with a BMI between 32 and 39.9, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers to be in the \"obese\" range. How to fix health problems with exercise . Even if the personal health care provider says there aren't any contraindications for participating, that doesn't necessarily mean a person in this BMI range will be able to participate in the whole program, the Boy Scouts' website says. People with a BMI of 31.9 or less need a medical recommendation, too, but don't receive the additional health scrutiny. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta and CNN's Living Well expert, said she found the restrictions on children with a BMI of over 40 to be somewhat discriminatory. \"Any organization can make their own rules, but as a pediatrician I feel like we should be promoting physical activity for everybody, be as inclusive as possible, and only exclude from activity if there's a physical threat to their health,\" she said. On the other hand, she noted that in some summer programs there are physical activities involving equipment that has a weight or size limit for safety reasons. That should be a restrictive factor for those particular activities, she said, because of the danger to a participant who doesn't meet the requirements. BMI is not a perfect indicator of health and fitness; a BMI of 40 means that the person's weight is much higher than average for his or her height. Muscle can elevate BMI, so some fit people have higher BMIs than normal. Physicians group labels obesity a disease . A BMI as high as 40 is unlikely to be mostly muscle, Shu said, but if there are health issues preventing that person from participating, she believes a doctor should determine that, rather than an organization making a blanket requirement. Shu doesn't look at BMI alone when filling out medical forms for children to participate in summer programs. In addition to evaluating the kids' health, she asks children how they perceive their own abilities in specific activities, such as rock climbing, and doesn't give permission for anything with which the child doesn't feel comfortable. The focus of the jamboree is not on the health requirements, Smith said. \"Our motto is: Be prepared,\" Smith said. \"We're the Boy Scouts. We've been preparing our participants for years for this.\" Shu offered a different perspective: \"In general, we'd like to encourage physical activity for everybody.\" In her view, that's something the Scouts are not honoring.

On trial: Dr Stephen Hamilton, a GP at Heaton Medical Practice in Bolton, is accused of raping the girl from the age of 10 . A family doctor raped a vulnerable schoolgirl from the age of 10 after secretly medicating her with an anti-depressant, a court heard. Dr Stephen Hamilton, 45, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, is alleged to have given the girl the drug citalopram before subjecting her to degrading sexual abuse. Manchester Crown Court heard how he would put his hands around the girl’s neck as he attacked her and told her ‘you deserve to die’. The historic offences are alleged to have occurred over two-and-a-half years between 2006 to 2009. Dr Hamilton, who is a GP and partner at Bolton’s Heaton Medical Centre,  was arrested after the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, complained to a teacher in November 2011. She . went on to describe the alleged abuse in graphic terms to police, . claiming that the GP would ‘restrict her breathing’ and ‘taunted her’ as . he raped her. The victim alleges that she suffered ‘nightmares’ about Dr Hamilton as a result of the alleged abuse. Opening . the case, prosecutor Louise Blackwell QC told the jury that the . complainant described Dr Hamilton as ‘very manipulative’. She said: 'In essence, what she described is that he controlled her in every way possible - including secretly medicating her.' The . court heard that a colleague at Dr Hamilton's practice reported him to . the General Medical Council when he learnt that he had prescribed the . girl citalopram, an anti-depressant not licensed for children. Dr Hamilton denies six charges of rape, three charges of sexual assault, four charges of child cruelty and a charge of administering a noxious substance. He answered ‘not guilty’ to each of the 14 charges when they were put to him in front of the jury moments before his trial began. Dr Hamilton is a partner at Bolton's Heaton Medical in Greater Manchester . During police interviews following his arrest, Dr Hamilton said he had been ‘completely exonerated’ by the GMC for the alleged offence. Miss Blackwell added: 'He threatened her that if she ever told anyone about anything of the sexual abuse that was taking place, that he would prove that she was making it up.' A relative of the complainant is alleged to have said the girl was ‘frightened’ of Dr Hamilton. The alleged victim told police Dr Hamilton would tell her she was ‘dirty’ and ‘filthy’ - leading her to ‘apologise to him’, the court heard. Miss Blackwell also told the jury that Dr Hamilton had been described by a key witness as someone who would ‘regularly speak about others in a derogatory way’. The witness described him as ‘being prejudiced against those less intelligent than he is and those less physically fit than he is’. Judge Richard Mansell QC warned the jury to ‘adopt a calm, dispassionate attitude’ to the evidence during the trial, which is expected to last up to four weeks. He said: 'Allegations of sexual offending, especially rape, can cause people to experience a range of emotions. 'It can engender feeling of sympathy or pity, outrage and disgust. Bear in mind these remain allegations unless and until you as a jury of 12 decide so that you are sure that the defendant is guilty of one or more of the allegations. 'Do not allow such feelings, if you have them, to affect your judgement in this case.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

Gus Poyet has been working on a deal to end Altidore’s nightmare at the Stadium of Light by allowing him to leave the club and move to Major League Soccer side Toronto as part of a swoop for Defoe. Poyet is desperate to add firepower to Sunderland’s strike force and Defoe has pedigree in the Premier League after spells at West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth. Lazar Markovic nonchalantly trots away after giving Liverpool during their 1-0 victory at Sunderland . Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football with a move to Sunderland . Defoe (right) has been training with former club Tottenham Hotspur and wants to return from the MLS . Black Cats misfit Jozy Altidore (right), pictured against Chelsea in November, could move the opposite way . 1 - Sunderland have won just once at the Stadium of Light all season and have the worst home record (nine points) in the Premier League. The biggest stumbling block to Defoe’s return remains his £70,000-a-week wages but the potential to trade Altidore has softened the financial burden for the Black Cats. Toronto had been holding out for a £6million transfer fee for the former England striker but are tempted by a straight swap provided Sunderland take on his massive wages. Defoe, 32, has been training with Tottenham’s Under 21 development squad to keep fit recently and, although there is no prospect of a deal at Spurs, he has no intention of heading back to Canada for the start of the MLS season in March. Markovic poked beyond Costel Pantilimon to score his first goal since moving to the Premier League . Emre Can grabs hold of Markovic as the Liverpool players rush to congratulate the goalscorer . How Poyet could have done with the former England striker in his ranks on Saturday as Liverpool coasted to victory without their own talisman. Brendan Rodgers did not want to expose Raheem Sterling to the coarse climes of the North East, where temperatures barely touched three degrees Celsius and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium. Instead, the player he believes will fire Liverpool to the top four was in Jamaica, relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30-dgree Celsius surrounds of his ‘winter break’. Liam Bridcutt was given his marching orders four minutes after half-time for two bookings . Bridcutt tripped Can as he marauded down the right into space to pick up his second yellow card . Rodgers said: ‘He will come back now and mentally it will freshen him up. It is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs.’ The only surprise at the Stadium of Light was that Liverpool did not add to Lazar Markovic’s ninth-minute opener, a close-range poke after a forceful run into the penalty area. Sunderland, in comparison, lacked energy and invention, although they were arguably better after Liam Bridcutt was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on Emre Can, but they never truly threatened parity.

        "document": "People who live in central London are meaner than those in the suburbs, who are happier, calmer and even a little bit boring, a study has revealed. Residents in Westminster, Camden, Kensington and Chelsea were deemed to be less considerate while those living in Bromley and Croydon were the nicest, according to researchers. The study by Cambridge University psychologists found those with specific personality traits tended to live in the same area, for example the most sociable people flock to boroughs in south London. This map shows the level of agreeableness by residents in London is more so in the outskirts, with the least agreeable people living in central parts of the city . Meanwhile those living in central areas were far more open to trying new experiences than their neighbours on the outskirts, who become progressively less adventurous the further out they are. The researchers also found higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London. In those areas, the most agreeable and conscientious types tended to be slightly more satisfied, suggesting that these traits are more important determinants of life satisfaction. Those with the most volatile personalities lived in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham, while the residents of Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth were most emotionally stable, according to the Telegraph. The most emotionally stable Londoners live in western central London - areas like Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth - while those in Hackney, Barnet and Lewisham are more volatile, according to the study . There are higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of London (west central) and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west, north east, and south London . While the study, undertaken by an international team of researchers, shows the most miserable Londoners live in Hounslow, Ealing, Hillingdon, Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Harrow. Psychologists found the least agreeable areas were in western central London - an area with the highest crime rate, busiest pedestrian traffic and some of the highest housing prices in the capital. Researchers believe this could support the idea that residents of big cities tend to be less considerate towards other people. Dr Markus Jokela, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, said: 'It’s very common for people to talk about where is the best place to live. 'But most research has tended to look at factors such as income and low crime rates, and only on a very broad geographical scale, failing to consider individual differences in personality. 'As a result, studies imply that all people would be equally happy in the same places. 'It’s a one-size-fits-all conclusion that, as we show, is misleading because one’s level of happiness is dependent on whether their environment is suited to their personality.' The most sociable Londoners flock to south of the river while the further out you live, the least extrovert the residents are . The more conscientious Londoners live on the outskirts with the least choosing boroughs in the north . Dr Jason Rentfrow, from the Department of Psychology at Cambridge University, said the findings could prove useful for those deciding on an area to live. He said: 'Together, these findings not only add to our understanding of the ways in which features of our personalities relate to our physical environments, but they also provide potentially useful information for choosing a place to live. 'Granted, most people don't have the luxury of complete control over where they live, but given their budgets, people can decide whether it's more important to live in the centre of town, where daily life is vibrant and accommodation is small, or further out where daily life is slower but space is more plentiful. 'Making the decision that fits with your personality could have an effect on your overall life satisfaction.' Psychologists used data from the BBC's Big Personality Test and honed in on the 56,000 Londoners to examine how associations between personality and life satisfaction differed across the 216 postal districts. The research, funded by the Kone Foundation and the Academy of Finland, was published  in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Those most open to trying new experiences live closest to the centre of the capital, with suburb residents significantly less adventurous .",

A 17-year-old boy who murdered a man with a single punch just days after he wildly attacked strangers at random in the street was jailed for life today. Eden Lomax had been caught on CCTV dealing one-punch knockouts to two innocent men during what he boasted were his personalised ‘bomb’ attacks. As one victim collapsed unconscious into the entrance of the nearby bus, Lomax was overheard joking: ‘I think he wants an adult day saver’. Scroll down for video . 17-year-old Eden Lomax (left) has been found guilty of the murder of Simon Mitchell (right) with one punch . First attack: CCTV footage of the first attack where on the night of Friday, 7 June 2013, just seven days before Simon died, Lomax punched a 31-year-old man in the face as stood at a bus stop . Attack: CCTV of the second attack, four days after the first. This time Lomax punched a drunken 41-year-old man without warning after they struck up a conversation . Just three days after the assaults in Bolton town centre the ginger haired teenager fatally set about Simon Mitchell after laughing and telling friends: 'I’m going to bomb him.' Mr Mitchell, 43, was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake Lomax’s hand saying: 'What’s a bomb?' Then as the victim laying dying on the floor with a fractured skull caused when his head hit the pavement, Lomax retorted: 'That’s a f***ing bomb.' A 16-year-old boy attempted to tend to the victim but Lomax told him to leave it because 'the piece of s*** deserved it,' it was claimed. Lomax fled the scene to drink and play computer games at a friend’s house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street. He was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from serious head and brain injuries. Pictures from the horrifying CCTV footage emerged as Lomax was convicted of murder following a two week trial. Today, he was ordered to serve a mininum of ten years in jail. Second attack: Lomax punched the victim once in the face, the force of the punch knocked him backwards through the open doors of a waiting bus . Knocked down: Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance . 'Bully': Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, described Lomax as a 'coward and a bully' The judge Mr Justice Peter Openshaw said: 'What he did suggests cowardly enthusiasm to resort to violence against men who through drinking were unable to defend themselves. 'Simon Mitchell was vulnerable through drink whereas the defendant is well built, physically fit and strong. Mr Mitchell was inoffensively telling him his problems. The defendant’s reaction was to deliver this punch.' Manchester Crown Court was told in the days before the tragedy on June 14 Lomax attacked ‘men he didn’t know from Adam’, leaving them prone in the street. CCTV footage was shown in court of Lomax unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30-year-old Stephen Swanton at a bus stop on Blackhorse Street, Bolton - because he had put his arm around Lomax and a female friend. A few seconds pass before Mr Swanton is knocked off his feet by the punch, hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious. Lomax can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the road.Further video evidence was served of the incident on June 11 at Bolton bus station, where Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance. The tragedy occurred after Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O’Donnell. He bumped into Lomax who had been watching movies with friends on an Ipad at around 8pm. Mr Mitchell made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide. But Lomax then ‘snapped’, as his own stepfather had also taken his own life and started saying to friends who tried to calm him down: 'I’m going to bomb him. Leave me alone or I’ll fall out with you.' Mr Mitchell, sensing trouble, offered his hand for Lomax to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said ‘if you don’t f*** off I will bomb you.' One eye witness told the jury: 'Eden asked the man to stop talking about suicide, but he wouldn’t listen. Eden was getting annoyed, his face dropped. 'He was getting aggressive. He was bouncing up and down on his toes. We could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before. 'The man asked Eden what he meant by his threat to “bomb” him and I was shocked when Eden hit him. 'It was horrible, all you could hear was his head thump. The man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was, he wasn’t aggressive. Eden punched him and said ‘that’s a bomb.' The witness rang 999 when he could see Mr Mitchell was not moving and added: 'He wasn’t breathing properly. He was making choking noises and he had turned purple.' Police attended an address in Little Lever, Bolton, two days after the attack where they arrested Lomax. In interviews he claimed Mr Mitchell was aggressive and he reacted in self-defence. Tributes: Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O¿Donnell. He was found suffering from head injuries . Killed: Simon Mitchell, aged 43, of Bolton, was found collapsed. Simon was taken by ambulance to Royal Bolton Hospital where he was later pronounced dead . He pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. After the case Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Simon lost his life at the hands of a young thug, who was driven by aggression and pent-up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch, which he referred to as his \"bomb\". 'Like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back. Twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever. 'It is was tragic way for Simon’s evening to end. It has left his father and family devastated. My thoughts are with them and I hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them. 'I hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch. Too many people have lost their lives in such incidents. I would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch, you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell.” Prosecutor Robert Hall said: 'Mr Mitchell had the misfortune to come across Lomax and what followed was a tragic, unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by Lomax when instead he could simply have walked away. 'CCTV footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence, this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that Lomax demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow Lomax’s bad example. 'Whilst today’s conviction of Eden Lomax is a successful outcome in terms of justice, it does not bring back Mr Mitchell or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends. Our thoughts are with them.'",

        "document": "A man slips behind someone else into a packed elementary school with an AK-47-type weapon. He goes into the office and shoots at the ground, then darts between there and outside to fire at approaching police. So what do you do? If you're Antoinette Tuff, who works in the front office at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy just outside Atlanta, you don't run. You talk. You divulge your personal struggles to the gunman, you tell him you love him, you even proactively offer to walk outside with him to surrender so police won't shoot. And then the nightmare ends with the suspect, later identified as Michael Brandon Hill, taken into custody and no one inside or outside the Decatur school even hurt, despite the gunfire. \"Let me tell you something, babe,\" Tuff tells the dispatcher, Kendra McCray, at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror. \"I've never been so scared in all the days of my life. Oh, Jesus.\" This brief outburst of emotion, moments after police entered the school Tuesday, was in stark contrast to her cool, calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call. As a go-between, she relayed his demands that police refrain from using their radios and \"stop all movement,\" or else the suspect would shoot. \"He doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off,\" she said in the call.  \"What else, sir?  He said he don't care if he die, he don't have nothing to live for, and he said he's not mentally stable.\" By the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- Tuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him. \"It's going to be all right, sweetie,\" she tells Hill at one point in the call.  \"I just want you to know I love you, though, OK? And I'm proud of you. That's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life.\" Tuff then let the gunman know that she'd been down before herself, but she'd picked herself up. He could, too. \"I thought the same thing, you know, I tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me,\" she said. \"But look at me now. I'm still working and everything is OK.\" That day, for everyone at that school, everything did turn out OK. Shots were fired, but no one got hurt. The gunman never made it to the classroom area, deciding instead to give up and lay down. This ending is thanks largely to Tuff, said McCray, the woman who fielded her 911 call. Echoing President Barack Obama -- who called Tuff on Thursday to thank her -- and many others, McCray described Tuff as a \"true hero\" for being courageous, calm and personable. \"You did a great job,\" McCray said, shortly after the two met in person for the first time Thursday for an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"You made my job a lot easier.\" Tuff, others 'thought it was a drill' Tuff had training in how to deal with such a scenario. School staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman Quinn Hudson said. Tuff and two other staff members -- a cafeteria manager and a media specialist -- were specifically trained in hostile situations. \"The training is so often and extensive, they thought it was a drill\" at first, said Hudson. While Tuff worked to keep the gunman calm and spoke with him, she signaled a code to her two counterparts, who immediately triggered a phone tree to tell teachers to lock doors and send children to safety, Hudson said. \"Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her,\" said Brian Bolden, the school principal. \"Tough. She has always been that way, from the first time I met her.\" He describes her as a strong leader whose authority everyone respects. The past eight years, Tuff has been with the Georgia school -- the past three at McNair. And she almost wasn't there Tuesday. Tuff was scheduled to be off that day, but because of a shift change, she ended up right where the school needed her to be. The school's existing safety procedures will remain the same while the investigation takes place, Bolden said. But he promised any needed changes will happen.  \"We will do everything humanly possible in our power to keep this next generation of learners safe.\" Counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said. Inside the suspect's mind . On Wednesday night, Hill, 20, was in a Georgia jail awaiting a still undetermined initial court appearance. Authorities are still hammering out exactly what charges he will face. Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Ray Davis, the lead detective on the case, added that false imprisonment and \"several weapons charges\" probably will be included as well. Whenever the charges come down, Hill will waive his initial court appearance, said Claudia Saari, public defender for the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit. She said members of her office's mental health division are handling his case and  declined to make any further comment. This week's incident is not Hill's first run-in with the law. He has a criminal history in DeKalb and neighboring Henry County that, while not \"lengthy,\" does include violence, Davis said. Specifically, Hill pleaded guilty in July to making \"terroristic threats and acts\" against his brother. Georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in March . Henry County court records show that, in addition to three years of probation, he was ordered to attend anger management classes. But that county's district attorney, James Wright, said Wednesday that there's no indication that Hill completed them. As to any connection to McNair Discovery Learning Academy, why he might have gone into it armed, and what he planned to do once there, authorities have not outlined a motive or a detailed plan. Being from DeKalb County, Hill \"possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration,\" Davis said. But \"there's no indication he had a grievance with the school.\" Before he entered the school, the suspect took a picture of himself with the assault rifle -- which he'd taken \"from the house of an acquaintance,\" said Davis, who did not say whether the weapon was stolen. So did Hill go in intent on killing people? Davis responded: \"I believe there was something else, but I don't want to go into detail.\" Some clues about his mindset are evident in the dramatic 911 call. With Tuff acting as the intermediary on the call, the suspect said that \"he should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, because he's not on his medication.\" Chief: It 'absolutely' could have been 'another Sandy Hook' While Tuff seemingly kept her cool inside the school, a swarm of law enforcement was springing into action outside. Police reacted \"very, very quickly\" -- including some officers who took up positions with long rifles -- \"to engage the threat\" and prepare for the worst, said Alexander, the DeKalb County police chief. \"We can all make a reasonable assumption that he came there to do some harm,\" he said, recalling last year's school massacre in Connecticut that ended with 20 students, six adults and gunman Adam Lanza dead. \"He entered a school, an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things: Either to do harm to those children and/or any first responders.\" Thankfully, that didn't happen. In fact, the suspect never went beyond the school's offices and never near its classrooms. While he fired some rounds at police -- and one officer shot back at him -- no one was hit outside either. And while there initially were fears that the suspect also had explosives, further tests indicated that was not the case: He came in with the rifle and a bag of ammunition, but no explosives. Community members and leaders are offering praise for Tuff and police, as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic. \"Was the potential there to have another Sandy Hook? Absolutely,\" admits Alexander, the police chief.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:32 EST, 2 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:45 EST, 2 November 2013 . Mitt Romney did not just have a problem with Chris Christie's obesity - he also was not above poking fun at heavyset women, it was revealed today. According to a new tell-all book about the 2012 presidential campaign, the trim former Massachusetts governor cared a great deal about fitness and naturally disliked those who did not. 'Oh, there’s your date for tonight,' he would jokingly tell his male staffers when they spotted a chunky woman on the street, Time Swampland reported. Scroll down for video . Fat-shaming: A new book about the 2012 campaign has revealed that Mitt Romney would make fun of overweight women on the street to his male aides . During the campaign, then-65-year-old Romney publicly said that he runs three miles every morning and works out on a stationary bike or elliptical machine. Last September, the Romney campaign released a letter from his physician praising him as a 'healthy appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male.' The book, Double Down: Game Change 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, reveals Romney nixed Christie as a possible running mate because of potential 'landmines' in his health and background. He also mocked the governor over his size. 'Romney marveled at Christie's girth,' according to the book. 'Watching a video of Christie without his suit jacket on, Romney cackled to his aides \"guys! Look at that\"'. Issues: A new book has revealed that Mitt Romney . (left) didn't ask Chris Christie (center) to be his candidate for vice . president in 2012 because of 'potential landmines' in his health and . background checks . Romney's search for a vice-presidential nominee was codenamed 'Project goldfish', but Christie was given the name 'Pufferfish'. The GOP presidential candidate, who values punctually, also was reportedly unhappy with Christie's tendency to arrive late for events. In response to the revelations, an aide to Christie said: 'Governor Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign’s request for documents in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist.' Christie, who underwent lap band surgery in February to help him lose weight, recently released a report from his doctor that said he 'has no medical limitations and is fit to serve as the governor'. The book also reveals that President Obama's aides considered switching Joe Biden out for Hillary Clinton as his VP. The authors explain that Christie, who is widely seen as a top candidate among Republicans for 2016, left unanswered questions about a defamation lawsuit that was brought against him earlier in his career - putting off Romney further. Dropped: Romney, pictured with his wife Ann, re-considered Christie but ultimately decided to drop him . He also avoided information about a Securities and Exchange Commission settlement involving his brother, the names and documentation of his household help, details about his time as a securities industry lobbyist and on his medical history, the New York Times reported. 'The dossier on the Garden State governor’s background was littered with potential land mines,' the authors write. It led Romney to initially consider Christie before striking him off the list - then reconsider before eventually dropping him again. Revealed: The new details are shared in 'Double Down', which is out next week . Some of the other concerns were over Christie's defamation cases - he has both sued and been sued for defamation. In 1994, his Morris County freeholder primary opponents sued him for claiming they were under investigation by the county prosecutor, the New Jersey Star Ledger explained. The case was settled and Christie apologized. In 1997, Christie sued opponent John Murphy after losing his primary for re-election as a freeholder, but details of the outcome was never disclosed. In another book published earlier this year, Christie had branded the vetting forms 'intrusive', saying the Romney campaign expected him to complete 75 pages. 'Asked about stuff with your kids, and . issues with your children, obviously criminal record, mental health . issues drinking history, drug history,' he told Dan Balz for 'Collision . 2012'. 'All intrusive stuff.' Romney also didn't like the was he showed up late to campaign events, according to the Washington Post. But there seems to have been no love lost from Christie's side either. The book claims Christie concluded Romney's campaign team was a 'gaggle of clowns who couldn't organize a one-ring circus', according to the Post. When Christie came under fire for his RNC speech, claims the book, he confronted Ron Kaufman, a Romney aide, and screamed: 'I'm tired of you people!!! Leave me the f***k alone!!!!' Another major revelation in 'Double Down' is that Obama's top aides secretly . considered replacing Biden with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . and carried out focus group sessions and pollings to help them decide it . it were the right decision. The consideration was pushed by the chief . of staff at the time, William M. Daley, who explained that opinion of . Obama in 2011 was at an all time low. By his side: The book also revealed that Obama's aides considering dropping Joe Biden as his VP . Ruled out: But aides ultimately concluded that she would not give enough of a boost to justify the move . 'I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,' he said. 'You have to remember, at that point the president was in awful shape, so we were like, \"Holy Christ, what do we do?\"' But the aides eventually dismissed the plan, concluding that, although Clinton was a popular candidate, it would not give a big enough boost to justify the radical move, the Times reported. The book also details Obama's opinion of Bill Clinton, saying that he found him exhausting and once told an aide: 'I like him... in doses.' But ultimately, it explains, Obama came to rely on Clinton as a counselor and immediately called him following Romney's concession call on election night.",

        "document": "By . Tom Gardner and Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:11 EST, 25 June 2012 . It has been almost two years since Aesha Mohammadzai arrived in America having been brutally ortured in Afghanistan by her husband. He hacked off her nose and ears after she tried to escape their abusive forced marriage leaving her mentally traumatised and horrifically disfigured. With the move to the United States came the promise of reconstructive surgery but it has been delayed as she battles with the psychological torment of her ordeal, and of leaving her homeland for a country where she speaks very little of the language. Touching: Aesha (right) has found a close friend in Miena Arsala, the daughter of the family caring for her . Aesha is expected to undergo six . operations, over the course of the next two years, the first of which . took place on Thursday morning at Walter Reed National Military Medical . Centre in Bethesda, Maryland, CNN reported. It began the process of expanding the skin in her forward for future use in rebuilding her nose. Aesha’s treatment at the military . centre was secured by U.S. Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and his office. He said: . ‘People know we take care of wounded soldiers. ‘That's kind of an obligation; what . else could you do?' he told CNN. 'But this – you don't have to do this. It puts a real . human face on our military. How can your heart not go out to Aesha?’ The 22-year-old was accompanied to . the hospital by Mati and Jamila Arsala, a couple who have been caring . for her. They have set up a website called Aesha’s Journey where . messages of support and donations can be posted. Speaking before the operation Aesha . told the news site: ‘I'm not scared. I'm happy. I suffered a lot in my . life. Now I feel that a light comes into my life.’ The Arsala’s have a 14-year-old daughter, Miena, in whom Aesha has found a close friend. Resilient: Aesha Mohammadzai relaxes at her new home in America where she is building a new life . Miena said of her adopted sister: ‘I'm pretty sure, once she gets all her surgery, she'll have a lot of guys drooling.’ The family reported that the first operation was a success, but they have apprehensions for what is to come. Aesha will face looking far worse . before she begins to look better, and the surgeries will bring about . severe pain and discomfort. The young girl’s story was first told . by Time magazine, who published a harrowing photograph of her on the . front page, horrifying people around the world. In 2011 she won political asylum in the U.S where she had fled a year earlier. She was given a prosthetic nose, but . full plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was . still not yet emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy . surgery required. Those who close to spoke of her . displaying volatile mood swings – oscillating between violent tantrums . and displaying deep affection to people around her. Beginning the surgery is a sign of just how far Aesha has come. Brave: Aisha, now 22, pictured wearing a type of prosthetic nose often used by film actors. Her nose and ears were hacked off by brutal in-laws after she was promised in marriage aged 12 . Psychologist Shiphra Bakhchi, 31, who has helped treat the 22-year-old for post-traumatic stress disorder believes the trauma of her disfigurement may have caused deeper mental scars than physical ones. ‘I really hope at some point she’ll be a functioning young lady that had a terrible trauma,’ the private practitioner told CNN. When Aesha was 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to sleep in the stable with the animals. The UN estimates that nearly 90 per cent of Afghanistan's women suffer from some sort of domestic abuse. When she attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were hacked off by her husband as punishment. 'When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out. In the middle of the night it felt like there was cold water in my nose. 'I opened my eyes and I couldn't even see because of all the blood,' she told CNN reporter Atia Abawi. New beginning: Before the surgery was able to begin Aisha was fitted with a prosthetic nose . Left for dead in the mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house and her father managed to get her to an American medical facility, where medics cared for her for ten weeks. They then transported Aesha to a secret shelter in Kabul and in August 2010, she was flown to the U.S. by the Grossman Burn Foundation to stay with a host family. She was taken in by a charity in New York called Women for Afghan Women who supported her and helped pay for her eduction. But Aesha soon became unhappy and her behaviour gave rise to concern. During one outburst during, she threw herself to the floor and slammed her head against the ground, grabbing at her hair and biting her fingers. Her primary guardian figure at the centre Esther Hyneman, who witnessed the tantrum said no one was able to prevent her from inflicting the injuries and they had to call 911 for help, Ms Hyneman  said during the CNN interview. Recovering: Aisha has received counselling following her traumatic experiences . Aesha was admitted to hospital for 10 days following that episode. Those who knew her said Aesha craved the close-knit family environment the centre was unable to provide. She left in December 2011, to live with with Mati Arsla and Jami Rasouli-Arsala, from Fredrick, Maryland - who are relatives of a Women for Afghan Women former board member - where she now appears to be adapting to home life. Ms Hyneman - who Aesha affectionately used to call 'grandma' - told CNN: ‘When she first came to us, she was an emotional wreck. ‘By the time she left, she was a different human being... So we’re all happy if she’s in the right place to further her development, but we miss her.’ Facing reality: Aisha's photo was on the front cover of Time Magazine in August 2010 . During the momentous few years since arriving in America, Aesha has had a prosthetic nose fitted at the non-profit humanitarian Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital in California as part of her eight-month rehabilitation. Dr Peter H Grossman said they hoped to give Aesha a more 'permanent solution', which could mean reconstructing her nose and ears using bone, tissue and cartilage from other parts of her body. Dr Grossman's wife Rebecca, the chair of the Grossman Burn Foundation, said Aesha was just one of the thousands of women who are treated with appalling harshness. She said: 'Aesha is reminded of that enslavement every time she looks in the mirror. But there are still times she can laugh. And at that moment you see her teenage spirit escaping a body that has seen a lifetime of injustice.'",

        "document": "Investigators found two fully functional pipe bombs and believe that a three-week manhunt may be taking a toll on suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Tuesday. \"Over the last few days we have found several items that undoubtedly confirm Eric Frein is hiding in our search area,\" Bivens told reporters. \"We have found a number of items belonging to Frein, some of which were hastily discarded.\" Those items include a pair of pipe bombs found in the last two days that could be detonated via trip wire or fuse -- consistent with what Bivens called \"Frein's non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance.\" The bombs were capable of causing significant damage, he said. \"I can't get into his head but I'm sure that he is stressed at this point,\" Bivens said. \"It's been a couple of weeks and I am certain that he is not sleeping well at night.\" Frein may have been spotted within the past 24 hours in the rugged area where he has been sighted numerous times, Bivens told reporters. The suspect was wearing dark clothing and was seen between 75 and 100 yards away. \"We're confident that he's in the area,\" Bivens said. Frein is sought in the death of Cpl. Bryon Dickson in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. Trooper Alex T. Douglass was wounded in the attack. Authorities have located several structures where they believe the suspect has stayed. Some items were found in a location that Frein may have used as an \"overnight accommodation,\" Bivens said. 'We are not going anywhere' As he has in the past, Bivens, who is spearheading the manhunt, had a personal message for Frein: \"I am calling on you, Eric, to surrender. You are clearly stressed. You are making significant mistakes. We continue to take your supplies and your weapon stockpiles. While you are no doubt weakening our troopers' resolve is very strong. We are not going anywhere.\" Bivens said Frein may have placed other explosive devices in the area and warned people to be very careful, especially since archery hunting season is about to begin. The self-styled survivalist may have planned the ambush and retreat for months or years, police have said. The search area is a wooded area around the border of Pike and Monroe counties. The area is not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, in the Pocono Mountains. The suspect has the advantage of knowing the terrain where he is hidden, officials said. Poring through a variety of clues . Last week, police said a  review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years. The hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as \"how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival,\" Bivens said. Police also were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Frein hung up after one ring, the source said. The search has yielded an empty pack of Serbian cigarettes, Bivens said. Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI, which last week named him one of its Ten Most Wanted fugitives. Soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time. Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians. \"I do think that we have significantly degraded his ability ... to adapt,\" Bivens said Tuesday.

        "document": "By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 09:17 EST, 26 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:12 EST, 26 July 2013 . A 34-year-old Pennsylvania man who was a fitness fanatic and was taking dietary supplements, died from a massive heart attack. Todd Battuello appeared to be in great shape, yet just weeks after using the 'fat-burning' diet pill OxyElitePro, he collapsed after dining with his wife. His family are now suing the makers of the drug that Mr Battuello was taking after learning the Food & Drug Administration had ordered a batch of the pills to be 'destroyed' earlier this year. Todd Battuello: He was described as a 'fun and hardworking barn manager' - despite his healthy appearance, Todd suffered a heart attack a weeks after starting to take dietary supplements . Mr Battuello  died on May 15th last year, just a week after he and his wife Lauren celebrated their first wedding anniversary. The couple had just finished dinner when he began to feel sick and began convulsing before collapsing. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Chester County Hospital. Todd Battuello (left) and his wife Lauren (right) set up their horse training business together having been childhood sweethearts and dating for nine years before tying the knot . Write caption hereOxyElite Pro is a fat-burning supplement that Todd had been using in the weeks leading up to his death. Miracle cure? OxyElite Pro claims to target the 'stubborn' belly fat that is difficult to shift. Yet even in early 2012 there were cases of users suffering heart attacks after taking the product . OxyElite Pro was the fat-burning supplement that Mr Battuello had been using in the weeks leading up to his death. The pill claims to remove 'stubborn' belly fat around the belly in particular. The family told Philly.com they have filed a lawsuit earlier this month against USPlabs, the Dallas-based company that produced OxyElite Pro, and Bodybuilding.com, an Idaho-based company that sold the product on its website. USPlabs has come under fire from the FDA, which earlier this month ordered the company to destroy its entire inventory of OxyElite Pro. In April, the FDA warned consumers on . its website that both supplements contained a stimulant called . dimethylamylamine (DMAA), which 'can elevate blood pressure and could . lead to cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, shortness of . breath and tightening of the chest . . . and may be particularly . dangerous when used with caffeine.' According to the lawsuit, a warning label on the OxyElite Pro bottle indicated that the supplement did contain caffeine. The family's lawyer Tom Kline said a toxicology test showed that Mr Battuello had DMAA in his system when he died. Lawsuit: Todds' wife, Lauren, is now suing ths website that sold the dietary supplements claiming there should have been more explicit warnings over the dangers of using the drug . Although a warning not to mix DMAA and caffeine is posted on the website now, the lawsuit alleges that USPlabs is to blame for Mr Battuello's death because the product did not give a warning to customers of the potential dangers or risks to health. USPlabs claim the supplement is 'pharmacist formulated' and 'university studied,' stating the product must be used with 'extreme caution, only by healthy adults capable of handling its true power.' The family are seeking more than $75,000 in damages. Jacob Geissler, USPlabs CEO, has not responded to MailOnline's request for a comment. Muscular: Here, Todd Battuello is shown grinning while sitting behind the wheel of a small tractor in a white tank top. He was described as a 'fun and hardworking barn manager' who 'maintains the vast property' This is not the first time that the stimulant DMAA has come under the spotlight. In February 2012, two U.S. Army soldiers had fatal heart attacks during training exercises. At the time, USPlabs told the New York Times: 'there have been over 1 billion doses of DMAA-containing products taken without a single corroborated serious health problem.' Mr Kline says the OxyElite Pro from Bodybuilding.com was ordered by Mr Battuello who was into physical fitness: 'but he had no idea how dangerous this product was.' On the website of the Pennsylvania horse-training company the couple ran, Evolution Training Center, Mr Battuello is described as the 'hardworking barn manager who fell in love with farm life.' His role involved maintaining the property and taking care of the horses each day. Mr Battuello and wife Lauren were high-school sweethearts who had been together for nine years before getting married. Mr Battuello's lawyer paid tribute to his client saying: 'He was a wonderful, loving young man who had his whole life ahead of him. He was an exceptionally warm, generous human being, and his life was destroyed by a drug that ended up being destroyed on an order from the FDA.'",

The B-52, nicknamed Ghost Rider, was mothballed seven years ago at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona - the so-called boneyard where decommissioned planes are kept in storage. It took to the skies once more on February 13 after months of painstaking restoration, which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more. Scroll down for video . Airborne once more: This B-52 bomber, nicknamed Ghost Rider, took to the skies earlier this month after spending seven years mothballed in Arizona . Ready to fly: The long-range attack plane, which first entered service in 1962, was painstakingly restored to airworthiness at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona . Bolted back together: The powerful jet, which can deliver nuclear and conventional munitions almost anywhere on earth, needed extensive replacements, but managed a 1,000-mile test flight without problems . The hot, dry conditions in the desert mostly helps preserve the aircraft, but also had the effect of bleaching Ghost Rider's grey hull to an almost white white. She was flown from Tucson to another base in Shreveport, Louisiana, where it will be tested and receive further repairs before rejoining the fleet. When fully functional, Ghost Rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons, conventional or nuclear, almost anywhere on the planet. The plane, which will be one of 76 kept flying the the Air Force, has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank, and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft. Easy does it: The flight, to Shreveport, Louisiana, was taken on at lower speeds and altitudes than usual for safety reasons . At the helm: Colonel Keith Schulz's, the Air Force's most experienced serving B-52 pilot, flew Ghost Rider on February 13 . However, for its first flight since being decommissioned in 2008, Ghost Rider was limited to 288mph and did not rise above 23,000ft. It also kept its landing gear down the whole way. Air Force chiefs say they waited until after the flight had ended to announce it due to safety concerns. In a published report on the restoration, Colonel Keith Schultz, who piloted Ghost Rider, said: 'I've been flying the B-52s since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years...she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems. Bleached: The hot Arizona weather, which mostly helps preserve the planes, also bleached parts of the B-52 almost white . Back in the fold: When fully restored, Ghost Rider will be one of 76 B-52s which the Air Force keeps active. The planes have been in service since the 1950s . 'It took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed.' The flight was the first time a B-52 has been brought back to duty after being retired. Ghost Rider was needed once more to replace a B-52 which caught fire and was left with a burned-out cockpit, according to the Shreveport Times. The plane was so badly damaged that Air Force engineers decided it would be cheaper to bring back an old plane than try to fix that one.",

MailOnline reported last November how a housing trust in Brighton wanted to use 36 adapted containers as a stop-gap for people without a permanent home. The containers were transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboarded walls. The structures were designed for a social housing project in Amsterdam in 2010, but the scheme was abandoned after funding issues.

Forest YMCA chief executive Timothy Pain said: ‘We’ve been overwhelmed by the support the mYPad project has received since its inception. ‘Equally, we’ve encountered so many obstacles and objections, but all of our hard work and persistence has paid off. ‘This isn’t just great news for us at Forest YMCA, but for the sector as a whole, as the mYPad project will now have its opportunity to prove itself as a credible solution to the affordable housing crisis that is affecting so many young people.'

        "document": "London, England (CNN)  -- A Canadian graduate student has found the only known printed copy of Haiti's Declaration of Independence, tucked away in Britain's National Archives, researchers said. Duke University student Julia Gaffield found the eight-page pamphlet, dated January 1, 1804, while researching Haiti's early independence, Duke said in a statement Thursday. The discovery sheds light on the early history of Haiti and the relations it had with its Caribbean neighbors at the time, Gaffield and Duke Professor Deborah Jenson said. Gaffield is researching early 19th-century Haiti for her doctoral dissertation in history, Duke said. She did research in France, Haiti and Jamaica, where she saw a handwritten copy of the declaration in the papers of Jamaica's governor at the time, George Nugent. It indicated there was a printed version somewhere, but it wasn't enclosed. In late January, Gaffield went to London for research at the National Archives, where she found the printed declaration. \"I wasn't specifically looking for it, but I had an eye out for it because I knew it was missing,\" Gaffield said. \"We figured there was an original somewhere, but didn't know if it still existed.\" The declaration had not been misplaced and had been in the archives for a long time, Gaffield said. The period had simply not been studied in detail, and Gaffield said she figures people who saw the document before probably didn't realize what they had. Gaffield said she was thrilled by the discovery, but had to wait until the end of the day to notify her advisers at Duke, in North Carolina. \"The archives are not the place to make a big scene,\" she said. Haiti's declaration is only the second of its kind in the world, the first being the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson and others, Duke said. The pamphlet, written in French, has three distinct parts, the National Archives said. The first two pages are titled \"Liberte ou La Mort,\" which translates to \"Freedom or Death,\" in which the generals of the Haitian army sign their names to an oath swearing to renounce forever the French yoke or die rather than live under its domination. Next, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the general-in-chief, addresses the citizens of Haiti in an impassioned defense of independence and the destiny of the nation. On the final page, Haitian army generals proclaim Dessalines governor-general for life and swear to obey without question laws issued under his authority. \"To bring this document to light in Haiti's darkest hour may be seen as a symbol of renewal and rejuvenation, helping Haiti rebuild its national spirit following the recent earthquake,\" said Ian Wilson, president of the International Council on Archives. \"Julia's achievement in recognizing the significance of this printed document deserves high recognition.\" Oliver Morley, the acting chief executive of the National Archives, said they were pleased to play a role in the discovery. \"It's incredible that the long search for this important document should finally end at the National Archives,\" Morley said. \"This declaration sent to the British government by Haiti's first independent leader is of great historical importance to both Haiti and the British people, and provides unique insight into the first successful slave rebellion of modern times.\" Jenson, a professor of French studies at Duke who has researched the U.S. publication of Haiti's independence documents, said the discovery also shows Haiti had a fully functional printing apparatus at every moment of the new nation's independence. Researchers had looked for the printed declaration before, without success, said Laurent Dubois, a Duke professor of French studies and history and one of Gaffield's advisers. In 1952, Haiti asked intellectual Edmond Mangones to find an original or printed copy so it could be displayed for the nation's 150th anniversary, Dubois said. Mangones searched in many archives in Haiti and elsewhere before writing with exasperation that all his searching had been \"in vain,\" Dubois said. \"It is really beyond belief,\" Mangones said at the time, \"that not even a copy of the original printed version has been found in France, or in England, or in the United States.\" Gaffield's discovery, Dubois said, \"has finally changed that.\" Documents from Haiti's early history have not been well preserved and are scattered in various places, said Dubois, who is working with other historians to rehabilitate Haiti's archives after the January 12 earthquake. Dubois and Gaffield consulted Patrick Tardieu, a noted Haitian archivist at Brown University, to confirm the document's authenticity. \"I was so happy to find out it was true,\" Tardieu said. \"It is an important document, and its discovery is important news for Haiti's scholarly community and more broadly for the people of Haiti.\" Gaffield said she hopes the discovery will remind historians, Haitians and the world about the early history of the only country in the Western Hemisphere where slaves successfully revolted to gain national independence. \"The Haitian Revolution was of immense consequence to Jamaica and other colonies in the Caribbean, as well as to the United States,\" Gaffield said. \"This find is further evidence that there was contact and negotiations going on between them. Haiti was not isolated after independence and it played a complicated role in a world based on colonialism and slavery.\"",

        "document": "There's no bigger beauty buzzword these days than ‘detox’. From deep-cleansing masks to purging baths, hundreds of treatments promise to cleanse our bodies after over-indulgence. Some experts warn that much of the beauty detox market is little more than marketing hype. ‘The term detox is a medical term that has been hijacked by marketing departments,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton. Scroll down for video . 'Detox' is the buzzword of the moment, but what does it really mean? And, do the products that claim to having detoxing products really work? ‘Traditional medical opinion views the term detox as a way to withdraw a potentially lethal toxin from the body such as in those who have abused alcohol or drugs.’ Here, Charlotte Kemp tests the most popular detox beauty products and asks skin, hair and nutrition experts for their verdicts on which might work — and which to ditch. FOOT FANTASTIC? Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack . Bodytox Detox Foot Patches, £3.99 for a two pack, nirvanahealthfood.com . The Claims: Adhesive patches you stick on your feet to stimulate the pressure points on the soles to release the body’s unwanted toxins. Charlotte says: According to reflexology, stimulating the meridian points on the feet can help to encourage a smooth flow of energy to the major organs of the body. But can what is little more than a plaster achieve what a trained reflexologist can? I applied the patches as directed — one to each foot — and they were moist in the morning. But was this toxins or sweat? Expert view: ‘Putting a detox patch on your skin may make the covered area sweat more,’ says scientist Harriet Ball of Sense About Science (senseaboutscience.org). ‘While very, very small levels of chemicals may be excreted in the sweat, it won’t have any discernable effect on the amount of chemicals in your body.’ DIGESTION TEA . Pukka Detox Tea With Lemon, £1.89 for 20 sachets . Pukka Detox Tea With Lemon, £1.89 for 20 sachets, pukkaherbs.com . The Claims: A blend of organic aniseed, fennel & cardamom — natural ingredients said to ease digestion. Charlotte says: I certainly felt virtuous sipping this herbal brew instead of my morning caffeine fix. It’s an acquired taste — I felt a little nauseous after the first cup — but it grows on you (think aniseed balls dropped in hot water) and it has to be better than my numerous cups coffee and tea all day. Expert view: ‘The spices in this have been traditionally used to support the digestive system and the adrenal glands — our internal stress management system,’ says nutritionist Henrietta Norton of Wild Nutrition. ‘The digestive system has a central role in the effective elimination of waste presented to the gut from the liver.’ PURGING BATH . Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g . Ina Crystals White Gold Detoxifying Crystal Salts, £47 for 1000g . The Claims: These bath salts contain minerals small enough to penetrate skin cells and be absorbed to help the skin expel internal toxins accumulated through alcohol and a hectic lifestyle. Charlotte says: For optimum results, the blurb recommends tipping the entire lot into the bath, which feels rather decadent at £47 a pot, and brushing the skin with the bath mitt included. Can this counter-act a month of drinking? Not sure. My skin felt wonderfully soft but surely you could get similar results by adding a couple of scoops of Epsom Salts at a fraction of the price? Expert view: Dr Sam Bunting (drsambunting.com) isn’t convinced the ingredients will detox the body in a medical sense. ‘We do not eliminate toxins like alcohol through the skin — we do it through the liver and it’s a very efficient organ at doing so,’ she says. It will soften the skin, though. PERFECT PORES . Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml . Ren Invisible Pores Detox Mask, £18 for 50ml, renskincare.com . The Claims: A deep cleansing face mask, formulated with French clay to draw out impurities and reduce pore size by removing excess sebum (an oily secretion produced naturally to lubricate skin) and removing dead skin cells. Charlotte says: My skin felt smoother afterwards and feels less bumpy, but I still have some yucky blackheads . Expert view: The clay will help absorb excess oil, says Dr Bunting. ‘This will reduce the appearance of pores temporarily. But it won’t pull toxins out of the skin. Those with sensitive skin need to be careful as this can be quite drying,’ SUPER SHAMPOO . Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml . Toni & Guy Cleanse, £6.49 for 250ml, hairmeetswardrobe.co.uk . The Claims: A deep clean shampoo for overstyled hair — recommended for occasional use to remove dirt, product build up and residue . Charlotte says: This is applied like a normal shampoo and my hair certainly felt less sticky afterwards. Expert view: Trichologist Glenn Lyons, clinical director at Philip Kingsley, is not convinced. ‘Every shampoo will cleanse and clean the hair. In my opinion, the word detox is a fashionable term and a marketing ploy. This product does no more than a cheap shampoo from a supermarket. It is more important to choose a product developed to suit your hair type. That will make a bigger difference as will washing the hair more frequently.’ NAIL THE TREND . Shine buffer set, £49 for full nail-care kit . Shine buffer set, £49 for full nail-care kit, p-shine.co.uk . The claims: Described as a detox for the nails, this is based on a Japanese manicure technique to enhance the natural pinky colour of nails by buffing without chemical-laden polishes. Charlotte says: After buffing with emery paper, you apply powder and then wax made of natural ingredients to soften the cuticles and leave nails a soft pink colour. Expert view: ‘We have a tendency to abuse our nails with all sorts of extensions, acrylic, semi permanent gel or toxic nail polish,’ says nail guru Sonia Hully of Nailberry (nailberry.co.uk). ‘The P-Shine manicure will help smooth, invigorate and improve the natural lustre of nails leaving them glowing and shiny,’ she says. AMAZING OIL . Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml . Neal’s Yard Detox Toning Oil, £15 for 100ml nealsyardremedies.com . The claims: This body oil contains the essential oils used for lymphatic drainage by aromatherapists and with regular use can help to eliminate toxins from the body . Charlotte says: To get best results, it’s recommended to use this after body brushing and a warm bath or shower which is all quite a faff. As directed, I tried to massage as vigorously as I could, concentrating on all the flabby bits like thighs and tummy. Expert view: ‘I think the vigorous massage is likely to be the most helpful element here — that could encourage lymphatic drainage,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘The aromatherapy aspect will improve the sensorial aspect of the ritual — but it won’t help with toxin elimination.’ COLON CLEANSE . Organic Pharmacy Colon Cleanse and Gut Repair Capsules, £29.95 for 60 capsules, theorganicpharmacy.com . The claims: Natural ingredients such as burdock root, leaves from the alfalfa plant, apple pectin and licorice help detoxify and rejuvenate the body at a cellular level. Claims clients have reported weight loss, better digestion and glowing skin . Charlotte says: Popping three of these every night is quite an ordeal. I can report that I was more ‘regular’ within a day or two but my skin isn’t glowing yet. Expert view: Nutritionist Henrietta Norton confirms that the ingredients ‘primarily offer fibre’. She adds: ‘There is no scientific evidence that these ingredients will improve skin, energy, mental clarity or weight but a well functioning gastro-intestinal tract can support good health.’",

        "document": "(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba muscled his way through for a late winner to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley. The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch, but Drogba's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies. Dutchman Hiddink, who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match, said Drogba had proved his worth again. \"He is proving already he is so dangerous, very strong and physically fit,\" he told Press Association. \"We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name.\" Arsenal went ahead in the 18th minute as Theo Walcott's volley deflected past Petr Cech, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea just after the half hour mark. Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner. He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. \"He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day,\" Wenger said. \"Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly.\"",

        "document": "Monday night saw the latest development in Tiger Woods's extraordinary career: the 14-time major winner played caddie to Jimmy Fallon in a chipping contest with Rory McIlroy. The sight of Woods laughing and joking with Fallon and McIlroy on The Tonight Show will stun those used to seeing the steely-eyed, sometimes surly and often foul-mouthed Woods who prowls golf courses. After McIlroy's recent wins at The Open and the US PGA Championship, the Northern Irishman and world No 1 is becoming a true rival to Woods as the biggest name in golf, and the two superstars joined funnyman Fallon to promote Nike's new Vapor irons. All smiles: Rory McIlroy (let) and Tiger Woods (right) on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon . Game on: Fallon challenged McIlroy ro a chipping contest, with Woods playing caddie for the TV host . One-nil: Fallon and McIlroy share a joke after the first pane of glass is shattered . Aim of the game: The pair attempted to break images of each other painted onto glass . Game for a laugh: Woods sat out the competition but joined in the fun and cracked a few jokes . Fallon managed to convince the pair to engage in a game of 'facebreakers', in which the aim was to chip golf balls in order to smash glass windows stained with images of Fallon and McIlroy's faces. The first to smash all the faces of their rival was the winner. Woods, who has suffered a miserable year through injury, culminating in a miserable performance in missing the cut two weeks ago at Valhalla, sat out the competition. All of which was probably wise - who knows what US captain Tom Watson would have made of Woods chipping the ball after the 38-year-old pulled out of the Ryder Cup last week. Instead, a beaming Woods played caddie for Fallon, setting up balls for the TV host to chip. He even cracked a few good jokes: 'Just getting the balls lined up for you, sir,' he obsequiously told Fallon, drawing a laugh from the audience. Fallon couldn't hide his delight at having arguably the greatest golfer in history as his caddie. But, as McIlroy took charge of the contest, Fallon screamed: 'Tiger, help me!' But the four-time major winner took the trophy. Meanwhile, Woods revealed he pulled out of the Ryder Cup because he did not feel he could have won a point for the United States. Woods withdrew himself from contention for the competition, which gets under way at Gleneagles in Scotland on September 23, and has ruled himself out of any further action until December as he attempts to get to the root cause of persistent back problems. 'Physically, I couldn't do it,' Woods told Sky Sports News of his decision to inform United States captain Tom Watson he was unavailable. 'I wouldn't be ready, and not being able to be there for my team-mates, the captain, assistant captain and everyone that's involved in the event, I just wouldn't be ready and I just couldn't help the team. 'When your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and I just didn't feel like I could be ready enough to get a point. Year to remember: McIlroy won The Open in July (left) and the US PGA Championship in August (right) Back problems: Woods has endured a miserable year as he battles to overcome serious injury . 'With that being said it was time to shut it down, get stronger, get more explosive again and get back for next year.' The former world No 1 said he is working in the gym and does not plan to pick up a golf club for a month with nothing on his agenda until his own tournament, the World Challenge tournament at Isleworth in Orlando, Florida, in the first week of December. 'I've got to be physically fit when I come back so I'll be explosive again and stable,' he said. 'Obviously this year was frustrating in that I didn't really feel that I gave myself much of a chance. 'I first had that pain in my back and it would go away, and then it would come back, go away, come back, until eventually it never went away... It got fixed, but I took that fall on No 2 at the (WGC-Bridgestone Invitational) and I hadn't done any agility training yet so my hip got misaligned and everything went into spasm again. 'We got that all calmed down again but then I had to play. Now I need to keep it calm, then strengthen it and then I'll be back. That's one of the reasons I've shut it down. I'll come back in December and be ready for next year.' VIDEO Arnie's surgery & Tiger and Rory appear on Fallon .",

Two British soldiers shot dead last week in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge attack by local police. Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Com-mando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident. But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces. Killed: Female medic Channing Day, 25, from Comber in County Down, Northern Ireland, has been shot dead while on patrol in in Afghanistan . Tragic: Miss Day (centre) smiling with friends in a photo posted on Facebook . Last night a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’. Military detectives are exploring whether the soldiers were killed after British troops shot dead an Afghan policeman. And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – . asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on . blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – . said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is . not clear at this stage.’ Corporal Channing Day (left), 25, and Corporal . David O'Connor (right), 27, are believed to have been shot dead by an . Afghan policeman . Sporty: Channing Day dreamed of joining the army since she was a schoolgirl . On Wednesday morning, Cpl Day and Cpl O’Connor were patrolling through the district of Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province. Military sources say that when the . patrol reached the village of Char Kutsa they saw an Afghan male . crouching on the bank of a stream. The man was shot dead and later . identified as a local police officer. An Army source said: ‘The man wasn’t wearing a uniform, so there was no way of knowing he was an off-duty policeman. ‘It now seems that he was washing, a . ritual before conducting daily prayers. If the soldiers saw him with a . weapon he might have been mistaken for Taliban. Misson: Investigators were today interviewing survivors of the firefight amid the conflicting claims about what happened . At work: Channing Day was killed alongside a Royal Marine in the attack . ‘The investigation is focusing on the reasons for the decision to open fire and what happened next. ‘Other Afghan police or villagers . reacted badly to this mistaken shooting, believing they were all under . attack. The situation was messy and confusing.’ The Ministry spokeswoman added: ‘Further investigation into the involvement or otherwise of the dead Afghan male is on-going. ‘Analysis of the events surrounding . this complex incident continues and is likely to take some time while . forensic and other tests are carried out.’ Tragic: The family of Channing Day, pictured with her mother Rosemary, have been informed of her death . Loss: British Soldier Channing Day (centre) who was killed in Afghanistanypctured with friends on her Facebook page . Channing Day harboured a schoolgirl dream of joining the Army, a teacher at her former school said. As a bubbly and sporty teenager in Northern Ireland she completed work experience with the forces in 2002 and worked well with everybody there, Strangford College acting principal Paul Maxwell added. She was always physically fit and achieved top grades in PE, excelling at gymnastics, trampolining and netball. Mr Maxwell said: 'She always said she wanted to join the Army, she was pretty much focused on wanting to join the Army.' He said her sporting prowess revealed her gritty determination to succeed. 'It was not just that she was good but that she always showed commitment, she stayed after school and did all the practice,' he added. Ms Day left school at 16 and Mr Maxwell said he believed she went straight into the Army. The acting principal added: 'Every pupil is dear to us and I can remember Channing as if it was yesterday, somebody we remember as being young, and still so young, is suddenly killed in such a tragic way.' Cpl Day, from County Down, Northern . Ireland, was the third female member of British Forces to be killed on . operations in Afghanistan. Colleagues considered her a rising star and . she was an outstanding sportswoman. She joined the Army in 2005 and . deployed to Helmand Province at the beginning of October. She had completed previous tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cpl O’Connor, from Havant, Hampshire, was on his third tour of Afghanistan having joined the Royal Marines in 2002. He had deployed to Helmand at the end of September. A total of 435 British military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since operations started in 2001. Yesterday Cpl Day’s sister, Lauren, said there were no words to describe the sadness felt by her family in Comber, County Down. She said: ‘We are an extremely close family and this has hit us all hard. ‘Channing loved the Army. If there . was one thing she knew growing up, it was that she wanted to be a . soldier – she would march around the living room and never missed . cadets. ‘Channing grew up into the bravest, beautiful, determined woman. ‘She has done more in her 25 years than most women her age and we are so very proud of everything she  has achieved.",

        "document": "By . Ashley Pearson . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 19 July 2013 . A . first time mum-to-be at 35, Ashley Pearson writes in a weekly column on . Femail Online about fertility issues, the ups and downs of pregnancy . and ultimately the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who . may have come a bit late to the party, but is happy to be here just the . same... As I wandered, contraction-ridden through the overheated hallways of the labour ward at Chelsea Westminister Hospital, I wondered if I had made a serious mistake in choosing to give birth here. Post-pregnancy woes: Ashley didn't realise how much havoc having a baby would wreak on her body . No, not because of the overcrowding, the long wait to see a doctor, the desperately hot atmosphere (I was told that despite the warm temperatures outside, the heaters were still running and no one knew how to turn them off) but because I was surrounded by women who appeared to have arrived straight from a photo shoot. Literally.  There was not one mum to be bigger than a size 10 (US size 6), hair was freshly blown out, nails immaculate and they’d perfected that whole 'I have make up on but it looks like I don’t' look. I arrived swollen, sweating and irritable, in the only item of maternity clothes that still fit me, with hair that could have used a washing and at least three sizes bigger than anyone else. I couldn’t believe it. Hadn’t anyone else gained weight in any place other than their picture perfect tiny bumps? I felt like a hippo who had wandered into a savanna populated only by gazelles. After a difficult birth which culminated in an unplanned C-section, I was over the moon delighted to bring home my beautiful, healthy baby girl. Everything I had heard about the all consuming love you feel for this little person was true. My gratitude was overwhelming. It was completely life-changing; and beyond my greatest expectations. It was also hugely difficult.  I’d anticipated challenges with breast feeding, lack of sleep, shifting hormones and recovering from the surgery, and I found them. However, what I was totally unprepared for is the state of my body after childbirth.  Naively, I had expected to walk out of that hospital not looking pregnant anymore. The reality was that in addition to still appearing to be deep into my second trimester, I actually looked heavier than ever, as my nine month sized bump had served to distract from what was going on with the rest of me, which had now aggressively re-emerged from the background. Seeing myself for the first time out of the shower was jarring. I wish more women had warned me about how that might feel. The first time I saw myself in a mirror post baby, the angry purple stretch marks, the milk- heavy breasts, the excess, loose skin on my formerly pilates-honed abs, was truly demoralising.  Some of it was due to the baby of course, but to some degree, much of it was my own doing. Having not thought about my weight or denied myself anything food-wise for the past nine months, I was left with the result.  I realised that I had a mountain to climb and felt entirely unprepared. Tough: Like Zac Goldsmith's wife Alice, 27, getting her pre-baby figure back has proved challenging for Ashley . Gathering up my courage, I decided to tackle things head on and step on the scales.  To my shock and horror I discovered I was 20 pounds heavier than when I had gone into the hospital! I had delivered a nine pound baby - how could that possibly be? As I expressed my dismay and began frantically Googling , I noticed a sheepish expression flicker across my husband’s face. Apparently, when I’d decided on impulse to weigh myself a week before I was due to give birth (after having avoided the scales through most of the second and all of the third trimester) my husband had shaved off a solid 25 pounds - being unable to see the digital read out myself over my massive belly. 'I knew you’d be upset,' he said guilty, 'and you had enough to worry about, so I knocked off a few pounds when you asked me what it said.' The man clearly knows me too well.  While it may have been insightful at the time, I was now left with a bitter and very unappealing truth about the state of things. A stone heavier than normal when I’d conceived, I had gained another three stone during the pregnancy. I thought about celebrities like Kate Hudson who managed to shift 80 pounds of pregnancy weight in three months before heading back to work on a film.  I was amazed at her self discipline and openly coveted her daily trainer, nannies and personal chef. The famously self-disciplined Victoria Beckham told Vogue that after the birth of her baby Harper, she headed straight to the gym and followed a workout regime prepared by celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. 'I worked out a lot. I ran a lot. I did it six days a week. I become quite obsessive when I get into something.' Beyonce was back on stage within several months of giving birth Blue Ivy and wearing sexy catsuits that showed off a stunning post-pregnancy body. She said at the time, 'Y’all have no idea how hard I worked. I had to lose 60 pounds. They had me on that treadmill. I ate lettuce!' Comparing myself to these women just made me feel more inadequate. I felt completely out of my league. Exhausted I could barely function let alone imagine working out. In fact, due to my surgery, I had been warned off working out for 8-12 weeks. Slimline: Thanks to trainer Tracey Andersen, Victoria Beckham swiftly got back into shape after Harper's birth . Demoralising: Both Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow got their bodies back but admit it was hard work . Tiring: Instead of seeing her next pregnancy as a holiday, Ashley will treat it like an Ironman challenge . As I struggled with night feeds, breast feeding and taking care of my new baby, I still couldn’t shake off the new and awful feeling that I no longer felt like myself. My life looked nothing like it had before and I was walking around in a body that just didn’t feel like my own. Needing to heal and advised to wait until exercising, I made a few big decisions in the weeks to come.  I stopped stepping on the scales for one. I knew it would take time to get back to a place where I felt good, and I didn’t want the pressure of worrying about numbers. I also immediately ordered some clothes in sizes that would have formerly filled me with dread - but that actually fit me at the weight I now was. Therefore I could stop picking through my meagre and well worn selection of maternity gear.  And lastly I made a decision to treat myself to a diet home delivery food programme. Knowing I had no time to shop for healthy food, the energy to prepare it or the discipline to meal plan, I figured after what I’d been through I deserved it. I chose Soulmate foods because I’d heard the food was good and they were able to tailor a programme for breast feeding mums like myself.  All three decisions were good ones for me. It began to dawn on me that I ought to endeavour to love and care for my altered and changed body the way I loved my new baby. Putting up with all indignities without hesitation and forgiving everything without question. These were the first of many steps I knew it would take to get back to a place that felt like me. It was going to be a long journey but ultimately I would focus on keeping my baby healthy and trying to be patient with what my body could now do. As a mother over 35 I was learning the hard way that it’s especially vital to be in great physical shape when having a baby.  After all, we are already pushing our bodies to do something it would have physically preferred to do a decade ago. We are asking a tremendous amount of our bodies –and maintaining optimum health and fitness before and during our pregnancies seems the least we can do in return. Indeed, next time I get pregnant, if there is a next time, I will do things very differently.   In her wonderful book, How To Be A Woman, Caitlin Moran talks about her second pregnancy and says: . 'This time around though, I’m doing things differently. For starters, I haven’t spent the last two months of my pregnancy thinking, \"Let Christmas last forever! Every morning can start with two mince pies, served with cream, six miniature heroes, and some Pringles! It’s Crisp-mas! Hurrah for pregnant me!\" 'As a result, I haven’t put on forty pounds, and I’m capable of things like \"walking\", \"standing\", and \"getting off the sofa without making an 'Oooof' Sound\".' Looking back, my biggest error was not viewing my pregnancy from a physical fitness perspective. It’s a gruelling physical challenge requiring a great deal of preparation and constant care. Afterwards, I felt like I had run a marathon that I’d prepared for by walking around the block.  Indeed, beleaguered by morning sickness at points and tiredness at others, I treated my pregnancy in its entirety like it was a condition or illness; resting, taking it easy, pampering myself – whereas I will view the next one like the Ironman challenge it is.

Fort Stewart spent weeks training volunteers in performing tasks the Army considers essential for troops on front lines- from dragging a wounded comrade to safety to loading 65 pound anti-tank missiles. Scientists from the Army's Research Institute for Environmental Medicine had volunteer soldiers don oxygen masks and heart-rate monitors to record their exertion. Scroll down for video .

Commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push-ups, sit-ups and 2-mile runs in order to devise a test that more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen, tank crews and other combat troops perform. Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers already in combat units. That said, they're completely unfamiliar to Army women so Fort Stewart gave its soldier-volunteers a month to train. 'When we started, it was very challenging because we'd never experienced any of these tasks before,' said Captain Nartrish Lance, 40, who after 21 years in the Army is getting her first taste of what it takes to serve in a combat unit. 'But, once you get to rehearse ... it becomes easy.' Co-ed: Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers but they are new to female soldiers . On Tuesday the troops- 89 men and 58 women-  were timed during the run through at Fort Stewart in Georgia . In seeking fitness standards based on real-word job requirements, the Army follows many U.S. fire departments that in recent years made entrance tests fairer to women than old standards heavy on push-ups and other upper-body exercises that favor men. Major General Mike Murray, commander of Fort Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division, said allowing women into combat units will do more than break one of the military's last gender barriers. He noted a very small Army 'population' will qualify, adding 'this overall effort is really about matching skill sets and attributes to the right job.' Whatever fitness test emerges for combat service should be a challenge for both men and women to show that standards aren't being lowered to accommodate female soldiers, said Lory Manning, a retired Navy captain who studies how military policies affect women for the Women's Research and Education Institute. 'The idea for the military isn't that any women coming through can pass their test,' Manning said. 'It's that anybody male or female who can pass the test should be able to serve in that occupation. If it's one woman out of a thousand, so be it.'",

        "document": "By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 14:51 EST, 25 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:51 EST, 25 March 2012 . Up to 40 elderly cancer sufferers are dying needlessly every day because they are being denied the best treatments, a damning report warns. Patients over the age of 70 are routinely being ‘written off’ by doctors who assume they are too frail for surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Such discrimination has led to Britain having one of the worst cancer survival rates in the Western world, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. Scandal: Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in the Western world because elderly patients are too easily ruled out for surgery. (Posed by models) The charity estimates that if the treatment of older patients matched that on offer in the U.S., as many as 14,000 lives could be saved every year. Ciaran Devane, chief executive of Macmillan, described it as an ‘unacceptable act of discrimination’. In the report, he points out that while cancer rates are vastly improving across most age groups, they have actually worsened in patients aged 85 and above. And despite major advances in diagnosis and treatment, the survival chances for patients over the age of 75 have only increased by a fraction. Mr Devane said: ‘Writing people off as too old for treatment is utterly shameful. We have a moral duty to treat people as individuals and give them the best chance of beating cancer, regardless of their age. ‘The NHS and social care providers . must wake up to the specific issues older people face and ensure . treatment decisions are based on their overall health, not just their . date of birth.’ The report . warns that many doctors are wary of offering elderly patients surgery, . chemotherapy or radiotherapy as they are more likely to suffer . debilitating side effects, including sickness and extreme tiredness. The body is also more prone to infection which can cause death. Warning: While cancer survival rates have improved for most other age groups, they have actually worsened for those aged over 85, the study found. (Posed by models) Many doctors are also often worried about putting patients forward for treatment if they have illnesses such as dementia and diabetes in case their drugs or the condition itself causes complications. But the report urges doctors to look at patients’ health and physical fitness rather than their date of birth. It points out that while one 78-year-old may be bed-bound, another might be running half-marathons. Figures cited in the report show that only 36 per cent of cancer patients in England over the age of 75 are likely to survive their illness. This compares with 49 per cent in Sweden, 45 per cent in Germany and 40 per cent across Europe as a whole. The most recent figures show that between 1995-97 and 2003-05, cancer mortality rates dropped by 17 per cent for those under 75. By contrast, they fell by only 6 per cent in the 75-84 age group and they actually increased by 2 per cent among the over-85s. Professor Riccardo Audisio, a breast cancer surgeon at St Helens Hospital in the Wirral, admitted: ‘We have huge evidence of under-treatment for these patients. ‘It is despicable to neglect, not to offer, not to even go near to the best treatment option only on the simple basis of the patient’s age. This has been a horrible mistake that, particularly in the UK, we have suffered from.’ Last year, research found that only 54 per cent of breast cancer patients over 70 were given surgery compared with 85 per cent of younger patients.",

A teenager who bought a machine gun and 187 rounds of ammunition and imported them from the US disguised as ornamental owls has been locked up. Reza Khalilzada, a Dutch national, ordered the Uzi machine gun from the United States but was caught when his parcel was intercepted by customs officials on August 8 last year. The package's label stated that it contained a ceramic dish and an ornament featuring three ceramic owls sitting on a log but x-rays revealed that in fact it held the lethal IWI .22 calibre UZI machine gun and 187 rounds of ammunition. Reza Khalilzada, a Dutch national, ordered the Uzi machine gun from the United States but was caught when his parcel was intercepted by customs officials on August 8 last year . Following the discovery, US Homeland Security notified Metropolitan Police and officers from the Met’s Central Task Force carried out a search of his address – where he lived with his parents and three siblings. During the raid of the family home in Pinner, Middlesex, on August 14 last year, officers uncovered the barrel of an AK-47 rifle under his mattress - which is also believed to have been imported from the US. When detectives questioned Khalilzada about the machine gun, he told police he had responded to a website advert offering money to provide a ‘drop-off address’ for an unknown package, because he was not doing well at college and wanted a job. During the search of his bedroom, officers also found a rucksack containing nunchucks, CS gas, a lock knife, lighter fluid, aerosol cans, a lighter, a catapault and ball bearings, a scarf and bandana, balaclavas, gloves, field dressing for wounds and bandage tape, amphetamines, ecstasy and four CDs containing images and videos of Khalilzada's family. Detectives also seized ear defenders, three computers and a number of USB memory sticks, £600 in cash and several bank cards. Khalilzada, 18, was charged with firearms offences on August 15 last year. However, the next day his parents reported that another package - also from the US - had been delivered for him. The imported parcel stated it contained a ceramic dish and an ornament featuring three ceramic owls sitting on a log but x-rays by US custom officials revealed that in fact it held the lethal IWI .22 calibre UZI machine gun, pictured, and 187 rounds of ammunition . It contained various parts of an assault rifle which, when combined with the AK-47  rifle barrel found under the mattress, created a fully functional, automatic assault rifle with the potential to kill. The ammunition seized at the US border also fitted this rifle. Examinations of Khalilzada’s computer showed it was heavily encrypted but the teenager failed  to supply police with a password, which he claims he has forgotten. He admitted two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon (AK-74 barrel and CS gas), and two counts of possession of a controlled drug (MDMA and amphetamine) and was found guilty of another weapons charge and customs charges at Isleworth Crown Court. He was sentenced to six years behind bars. During a raid at his family home in Pinner, Middlesex, police officers found an assault rifle, pictured, CS gas, drugs, knives and three computers . During the search of his bedroom, officers also found a rucksack containing nunchucks, CS gas, a lock knife, lighter fluid, aerosol cans, a lighter, a catapault and ball bearings, a scarf and bandana . Detective Inspector Rob Murray, of the Met’s Central Task Force, said: ‘Khalilzada's arsenal contained everything one person would need to potentially kill and seriously injure a lot of people. ‘With the assistance of our partners in the United States, we've taken these weapons off the streets and out of criminal hands, where they could have potentially resulted in very serious consequences. ‘I hope this case and the sentence acts as a deterrent to anyone thinking of being involved in the illegal purchase or distribution of firearms and ammunition.’ Matthew Etre, of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations Attaché in London, said: ‘This case is an example of Homeland Security Investigations' commitment to investigate and help disrupt the flow of weapons and sensitive technologies illegally exported from the United States.’ Khalilzada admitted two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon (AK-74 barrel and CS gas), and two counts of possession of a controlled drug (MDMA and amphetamine) and was found guilty of another weapons charge and customs charges at Isleworth Crown Court .

        "document": "Three days ago – on Halloween – investment banker Rurik Jutting updated his Facebook with the words: ‘Money DOES buy happiness.’ That night on the 31st floor of his £2,000-a-month Hong Kong apartment, a scene from a horror movie unfolded. A prostitute’s throat had been slit, and police later found another woman rotting in a suitcase, trussed up and all but decapitated, who had been there for several days. Graduate: Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, (pictured with an unknown Asian woman) has been charged after two women were found dead at his flat in Hong Kong . The bloodbath has yet to be explained, but Cambridge-educated Jutting’s final ‘update’ to his wealthy friends and family is a small, if baffling, insight into his state of mind around the time of the killings. The 29-year-old financier with investment bank Merrill Lynch certainly had a taste for the high life. He dined with a string of beautiful women in exclusive restaurants across the globe, according to those who know him. He enjoyed skiing holidays in Courchevel, the Alpine playground for the elite, and when in London he relaxed at a private members’ club in Shoreditch. The son of an engineer father and a nursery teacher mother, Jutting was described by one colleague in Hong Kong as someone who ‘talked very loud and made loads of money’. Earning a six-figure sum as an equity trader and living in luxury in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, Jutting was apparently going from strength to strength. His parents' home: The £1.1million Victorian house in Surrey where his parents Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, live . Grand: Before his parents' moved to their current home (above), Jutting lived with them in Grade II-listed house . But for reasons that are unclear, he appears to have mysteriously quit his job in the days around the first murder. ‘He always seemed so sad – he never said hello to any of us or smiled,’ said an employee who works in the skyscraper where Jutting lives, and who saw him being led away by police at around 4am on Sunday. Jutting had been in Hong Kong since July 2013, having transferred from Merrill Lynch’s London office where he had worked since July 2010, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Prior to that, he worked as a trader in capital markets at Barclays in London. Once physically fit, Jutting had been a member of the lightweight rowing club and the cross-country running club at Cambridge University, where he studied law and history at Peterhouse College in the mid-2000s. Heritage: The property his parents' live in inspired the illustrations in 'The Wind in the Willows' He was also the secretary of Cambridge University’s history society, which is called Clio, whose honorary members include intellectual heavyweights such as philosopher Professor Roger Scruton and the historian Dr David Starkey. A senior member of the university told the Daily Mail: ‘He was a bit of an action man, always on the move. I never heard about him getting into any serious trouble, so this comes as a real surprise.’ Prior to Cambridge, Jutting studied at £34,000-a-year Winchester College – motto: ‘Manners makyth man’. One contemporary at the independent boys’ school, Thomas MacThomas, wrote on Twitter yesterday: ‘So I knew Rurik Jutting when at school. Kinda disturbing. He was quite strange.’ As teenagers, Mr Jutting and his younger brother lived with their parents in a Grade II-listed house in Chertsey, Surrey. A neighbour there said yesterday the family were ‘nice enough’ but were ‘quiet and kept themselves to themselves’. After Rurik moved away to Cambridge, his parents, Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, moved to a grand Victorian manor worth £1.1million in the nearby commuter town of Cobham. The picturesque home, which is set behind wrought iron gates and surrounded by woodland, was the inspiration for Ernest Shepard’s illustration of Kenneth Grahame’s children’s classic The Wind in the Willows. Mrs Jutting is a teacher who runs Tumble Tots classes for toddlers in Surrey, her husband is an engineer, and they keep bees in their garden. Their other son, Auryn, 27, attended Oxford Brookes University and is believed to live in Brighton with his girlfriend. Rurik Jutting (right) was living the high life before he was charged with the murders of two prostitutes today . A man, who was thought to be Jutting’s father, looked exhausted as he told reporters yesterday morning: ‘Please respect our privacy.’ Prior to his arrest, Rurik Jutting had been in a relationship with an Asian woman called ‘Yanie’, according to posts on his Facebook page. He also ‘liked’ a Facebook page with photos of provocatively dressed Asian women. In one of his last postings, Jutting seemed to suggest all was well in his world. He posted a comment, copied from the internet, which read: ‘Is 29 the perfect age? I feel more secure, I’m a better friend and I know my limitations. No wonder 29-year-olds are the most popular age group.’ Only hours later, he was phoning the police to allegedly confess to murder. Government workers remove the body of a woman who was found dead at a flat in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district in the early hours of this morning. A British man was been arrested in connection with the murders . Officers investigate two adjacent balconies in the flat where the bodies were discovered on Halloween night .

        "document": "A U.S. Army paratrooper returned to Afghanistan late last year for his second tour of active combat duty less than two years after his left foot was amputated. Lt. Joshua Pitcher lost the foot after it was blown apart two years ago by a roadside bomb. It has since been replaced with a carbon fiber prosthetic that allows him near full mobility. The heroic 25-year-old overcame depression, heavy drinking and a 40-pill-a-day Oxycontin habit to return to the battlefield. Pitcher’s injury occurred only two months after he arrived in the war-torn Middle Eastern country, in April 2012, when he stepped off the road to urinate, he told the Washington Post. Hero: Joshua Pitcher, pictured left and right, returned to active combat duty with a prosthetic leg . A sound similar to a firecracker went off just as he zipped up his pants. ‘I looked down at my foot, and I was like, ‘Uh-oh,’ he recalled to the paper. He was soon airlifted to a U.S. military hospital in Germany, and only days later – despite not having a left foot – posted defiantly to Facebook. ‘I will return,’ he wrote, and then confided in others that he planned to return as a paratrooper. Pitcher was then transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for rehabilitation. ‘And then I just spiraled down into complete depression,’ he recalled. His recovery was progressing along until he demanded to be temporarily released for his then-fiancee Michelle’s college graduation. Just another day in the office: Pitcher grabs a seat for a minute while deployed in Afghanistan . Just one of the guys: Pitcher (second from left) pictured in Afghanistan with his platoon . ‘They said, ‘Josh, it’s too early. You can’t go,’ his father Randy told the Post. ‘’No, I am going,’ Pitcher responded, according to his father. ‘Take the damn IVs out of my arm, and I will prove to you I can go.’ The trip sparked an infection in his left leg, but it soon cleared up. Pitcher had gotten up early and was lifting weights the June 2012 day he was due to receive his prosthetic leg when doctors delivered devastating news, he said. He had another infection in his left leg, and it would require surgery. ‘That meant I had to wait another month, and that took depression to a whole new level,’ Pitcher said. ‘You are so tired of being in a wheelchair, so tired of being on crutches.’ Stood by her man: Joshua and Michelle Pitcher at their wedding last year prior to him being redeployed . Their big day: Pitcher recovered to the point he had a wedding free from complications of his amputation . The downward spiral caused him to suffer severe mood swings including ‘extreme anger,’ now-wife Michelle lamented. Pitcher also started convincing friends to take him to nearby bars where he drank heavily. He also began downing dozens of powerful Oxycontin pills a day, as many as 40, he recalled. The pills and drinking left him in a ‘zombie-like’ state, said Michelle Pitcher. His prosthetic leg came in July 2012, he was walking on it within a week. Three sessions per day in the gym helped him recover to the point he competed in the Army Ten-Miler, an annual race to the Pentagon. Pitcher could not sprint, but strapped on a backpack with 50 pounds of weights and jogged the majority of the way, he recalled. His determination led him to complete the Army Physical Fitness Test – 80 push-ups, 80 sit-up and a two-mile run – in only 14 minutes, 23 seconds. Pitcher ranked in the top 10 per cent among all active-duty soldiers. He was asked to join the U.S. Paralympics Team during a January 2013 snowboarding trip to Colorado. ‘No, I am staying in the Army,’ he replied. He kept his word: Pitcher attending Michelle's Eastern Kentucky University graduation while still recovering . Decorated: Pitcher being awarded the coveted Expert Infantry Badge by brigade commander Col. Tim Watson during a ceremony last year . Pitcher’s first test jump from a C-17 plane June 16 of last year caused him to worry if the prosthetic would hold up as he plunged back to land. ‘Keep your feet and knees together,’ he kept reminding himself – one of the first lessons taught to paratroopers. ‘He landed pitch-perfect,’ his proud father said, recalling the afternoon he spent in the landing zone. ‘At that point, he walked over and said, ‘Okay, I can do this.’ Pitcher was soon recommissioned into the prestigious 82nd Airborne Division. He was then redeployed to Afghanistan in November, and has led a platoon of 21 paratroopers into battle as if nothing ever happened to his foot - as if the prosthetic blade was never attached to his leg just below the knee. He is one of only 57 amputee soldiers to return to combat, and only the second paratrooper. Grueling combat duty does take its toll on Pitcher – he is not allowed to take Oxycontin anymore, the pain can sometime be excruciating. ‘You just have to accept it’s going to hurt and deal with it your own way,’ Pitcher told the paper from his post. He then jokingly took a knife and held it at the end of his ‘blade’ – like a bayonet. ‘If we get attacked, I will just kick.’ But he has also promised to retire if he gets another purple heart – the medal awarded to soldiers injured in the line of duty. For now, he is just another soldier prepping for his next mission.He returned.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- It took a lot of effort for Leo Bonten to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp. For starters, he had to break the damn thing in a freak kiddie pool accident. As one does. Seriously. That's how it all started, thus confirming what I've always said: \"Kiddie pools are not toys, and should only be used as giant, outdoor toilets.\" I chose that as my high school yearbook quote over \"Carpe diem.\" But it really happened. In July 2012, the unfortunate Dutchman suffered a terrible break while goofing off with his cousin in south Rotterdam. Over time, the leg became infected, ignored, and more infected to the point where, in July of this year, doctors had to remove it surgically. So, Bonten, now 53, settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man. But it was damaged beyond repair, and there was nothing he could do. Except, you know, maybe ask to keep it. \"It's my leg,\" he told me over the phone. \"It's my legal right.\" Sort of. We'll get to that. Either way, he asked for it, which I'm sure lead to a rather awkward, if not spirited, conversation with hospital administrators. \"Sir, we just can't give it to you.\" \"Right. Well, what if I bring in my own tin foil?\" Generally speaking, hospitals use very specific protocol with amputations. For safety and sanitation reasons, they're usually required to incinerate them. Body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral (and, perhaps, exhumed) with proper legal oversight. But that was an expensive option, and not one Bonten was able to afford. Though, probably worth it just to see the face of the grave digger. \"Don't go anywhere, Dave. And hold on to that shovel.\" So, Bonten wouldn't be doing that. There would be no funeral. Still, he wanted his leg, for he had a crazy idea. He would turn it into a lamp. Sort of like the one from Ralphie's house in \"A Christmas Story.\" But real. And significantly more severed. Thus, Bonten and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations, where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances. You see, leading up to his surgery at Erasmus Medical Center, a news reporter gave Bonten a book by Joris van Casteren about a mysterious leg found by a fisherman in the IJssel River. That book led Bonten to a pathologist named Frank van de Goot, who was more than happy to help with all this lamp nonsense. You see, as per his profession, van de Goot was able to legally obtain Bonten's leg from the hospital after surgery. Thus, the leg was then couriered to van de Goot as specified by the law. He would inspect it. He would study it. And, ultimately, he would preserve the leg with chemicals so it could remain ... a leg. Problem solved. Almost. Someone still had to make it into a lamp. Eventually, as Bonten's story became an even bigger media sensation, a designer named William Schaper Kotter decided to reach out and offer his services to complete the vision. This thing was actually going to happen. And now it's done. They made a lamp out of his leg. Today, the leg sits suspended in a glass cylinder filled with a solution. Surrounding that cylinder are metal bars, symbolizing two years of physical \"imprisonment\" suffered by Bonten while the leg deteriorated. Above that is an empty space. This represents the rehab period. And on the top sits a large remote-controlled LED light, flanked by two metal wings, honoring Bonten's upcoming freedom from the help of a new limb. Which is where the story takes another twist. The issue of the prosthetic. Bonten explained to me that the one he's getting through his insurance is not top of the line. Quite simply, he wants something better. Something stronger. Something more agile. Because, before all this, he played soccer. He ran. He boxed. It was one silly accident that changed everything. But a high-tech prosthetic will cost him. So, he decided to sell his lamp on eBay for â‚¬100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing. You can't sell human parts on eBay. On the plus side, you CAN sell used socks. Don't ask me why I was looking. Just know that you can. So, until somebody comes to him with an offer, Bonten will just keep it at home, where he just returned after a lengthy stint in rehab. His lamp will arrive on Sunday, and he'll finally be re-united with his leg. \"My leg is amputated,\" he says, fully understanding the humor and absurdity in all this. \"But it gives me a good feeling that I still have it.\" And if he wants to cover the foot with a dirty, used sock ... sadly, I know just the place.

        "document": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Hindu holy man castrated himself in India Wednesday following the arrest of popular preacher Asaram Bapu, revered by millions across the country for his sermons on enlightenment. Police have charged the 72-year old guru with raping a 16-year-old schoolgirl at one of his ashrams, or religious centers, in August. Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh found Baba Premdas, a 60-year old follower of Bapu, bleeding at his home in Amethi from apparently self-inflicted wounds, city police chief Alankrita Singh told CNN. Premdas was admitted to a local hospital and then taken to a bigger health facility for surgery where his condition \"is stable\", said Singh. Asked whether his act was related to the arrest of Asaram Bapu, Singh added, \"We have heard such things, but all this is unconfirmed.\" \"Some say it was because of Bapu's arrest,\" said Singh to AFP earlier, \"some say it was because he feared ending up in Bapu's situation. No one knows.\" Bapu has denied the sexual assault allegations leveled by the teenage girl and her parents, both devotees of the guru. The elderly preacher has also claimed he is physically incapable of rape but police say medical tests show him to be in good shape. \"The team of doctors is saying he is perfectly, medically, mentally and physically fit,\" said Ajayal Lamba, Deputy Commissioner of Police in Jodhpur. Bapu, also referred to as the \"godman\" in local Indian media, is currently in jail awaiting trial after a court rejected his bail plea earlier this week, public prosecutor Anand Purohit told CNN. The prosecution plans to present a detailed dossier of the charges in the trial soon, he said. This month's unfolding rape case against Bapu is just the latest in a series of sexual assault incidents in India since late 2012 that have gained high-profile attention both for their frequency and ferocity. It was the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi last December that galvanized Indian society and the media in particular, to examine the pervasive incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women. The barbarity of the crime ignited a wide-ranging discussion across all levels of the Indian media and prompted multiple debates in the national and regional assemblies. Stung into action by public outrage, the government instituted new laws and crucially stricter punishments, which includes the death penalty when victims are killed or left in a vegetative state. Furthermore in a sharp departure with previous practice, predatory behavior such as voyeurism, stalking and groping can now lead to arrest and punishment. India's court system is now making greater use of fast-track trials to prosecute the most heinous and high-profile crimes against women. Local and national media have maintained their spotlight on sexual assaults and other violence against women, leading to a torrent of disturbing reports following last December's horrific rape incident. In March, at least five men from a local tribe gang-raped a Swiss woman camping with her husband in a forest in India's Datia district. A court convicted six men to life in prison four months later. In April, a 4-year-old Indian girl was raped by a 35-year-old man in India's central Maharashtra state. The girl suffered brain damage and was in a coma for two weeks before dying from cardiac arrest. And in June, at least three men gang-raped a 31-year-old American tourist in northern India after she visited the Vashishth Temple after midnight. She accepted a ride from the group after failing to find a taxi. They drove her to a wooded area where they assaulted her. While such incidents have been covered extensively by international news media, an even larger number of cases are only reported in domestic Indian news outlets -- and an unknown number simply go unreported. Just this week in local media, the Times of India reported two men gang-raped a 27-year-old woman who had gone to a local dairy in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the Hindustan Times reported at least six to seven girls were lured to and raped at a deserted steel mill south of Mumbai over the past half year, and the Indian Express reported the story of a 14-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by two people over several months in western Gujarat state. Villagers discovered the girl was pregnant but later miscarried twin babies. According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, the country recorded 24,923 cases of reported rape in 2012 -- a 57% rise in reported cases since 2003. This number is widely considered to be extremely underreported for a country of more than 1 billion people. The United States, with a population of more than 310 million, recorded 270,000 cases of rape in 2010, the most recent year for which national rape statistics are available.

His friends have now issued a £15,000 fundraising plea to help with medical costs - with generous donations already raising more than £11,000. His parents Gary and Carol, both 56, and his brother Jonathan and sister Helena, who also ran competitively, travelled to the US when they were told the news. Gary Graham, who is self-employed, said: 'We got the phone call last Saturday night. It's just one of those devastating phone calls every parent never wants to get. 'It was made worse because of him living so far away and we didn't have all the details. It took us 48 hours to get here and all sorts were going through our minds. 'And then to walk into the hospital to see your son fighting for his life was just tragic. 'He's a strong guy and physically fit and he's been an athlete since he was 10-years-old and that's going to help him. He's determined and anyone who ran against him will know that.' After diving into the Cherry Creek Reservoir on September 21, Mr Graham lost all feeling and mobility below his shoulders and was transported to the Aurora Medical Centre before being transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

He took a scholarship at the university in 2008 and went on to win 15 All-American cross country and athletics titles . Because of work commitments, Mrs Graham, 31, a professional research assistant, doesn't live with him in Texas and he was visiting her at the time of the accident. When he injured himself, her quick-thinking efforts meant that her husband never lost consciousness and increased the chances of his recovery. Mr Graham, now a cross country coach at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, in Texas, has regained movement in his arms and began breathing on his own less than 48 hours after surgery. Mr Graham pictured at his hospital bed at Aurora Medical Centre, in Denver, Colorado . It is hoped he will be transferred to a rehabilitation centre and it is not known how much of the cost will be covered by his insurance. His father added: 'We are parents and we will do anything to help with the fundraising. We take the NHS for granted but Drew's life is in America. 'People in America started the fundraising and it's snowballed from there. Our friends and family in the UK have also been brilliant.' Colin Haggie, President of Gosforth Harriers and Athletic Club where Drew used to train, said: 'It's quite devastating really. He wasn't being daft, he just dived into some water.' As a Gosforth Harrier, he came through the ranks and by his late teens had firmly established himself as one of the region's leading middle distance stars. In 2007 he won the Northern 800m title and became North East Champion in both the 800m and 1500m. He then took a scholarship at Adams State University in Colarado in 2008, where he won 15 all-American titles across cross country and athletics. In 2012 he was named the United States Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches' Association Indoor Track Male Athlete of the Year. He was also named the Men's Central Region Track Athlete of the Year, by the US Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association.",

        "document": "John Alite has taken a baseball bat to countless guys. He has stabbed, shot and killed dozens more. He has been pistol whipped, been brutally beaten, has had his life threatened and survived two years in a Brazilian jail so appalling that the President of the country has said he'd rather die than go there. Today he is a free man, immaculately dressed and drinking a vodka Martini in Manhattan's Peninsula Hotel. And this, he has just announced, is the hardest time he's ever had. Because according to Alite people don't change, yet change is precisely what Alite is trying to bring to his life and, he hopes, the lives of kids on the brink of making the mistakes he made decades ago. It's the reason, he believes, he's still alive. Speaking to Daily Mail Online he said, 'Honestly I've thought about it every single day. I believe I didn't do the right thing but I believe there's a reason why I'm supposed to be here. 'When people say you baseball batted a hundred people and stabbed however many, you shot 37, I can't forget it. Let me tell you how I justified it. I didn't hurt women. I didn't rob an armored car in my life because that's a hard working guy and I would never be prepared to hurt him. Scroll down for video . New life: Mob enforcer John Alite has put aside a life in the Mafia to become a motivational speaker. He says: 'You can fool someone who's not a gangster. But take a street guy, a real tough guy and they can read through all his b*****t. You can't fake it. But you can learn it.' Convicted: Just two of the mugshots Alite featured in, both taken in Brazil in 2003 and 2004 when he was arrested over a string of offenses and held in its most notorious prison . 'But did I rob drug dealers? Yes, all the time. Did I hurt street guys? Yes, all the time. Did I shoot street guys? Yes, all the time. Did I shoot people who were hanging out with wise guys? Yes, all the time. But outside of that? No. 'What I did, I can't take back and when I was doing what I was doing I was proud of it. But I have enlightenment now. Whether it's because I got into trouble or whether it's because I got disheartened from them turning on me, doesn't matter how I got it, but I did get it eventually.' Now, three years after his release from jail, he is 'reinventing' himself as a motivational speaker who hopes to 'scare kids straight,' give corporate employees an aggressive edge and consult on movies and TV shows trying to accruately portray the world in which he once live and excelled. For more than twenty years Alite was a high ranking member of the Gambino crime family. He worked for the Gottis – both father and son. He was, he said, 'at the top of the food chain', one of their top earners and enforcers. He could never be a 'made' man in the mafia because the grandson of Albanian immigrants was born in Tirana, Albania. But he thought he was moving in a world governed by rules; codes of honour, loyalty and respect. Then, when he was in jail in Brazil, Alite was passed secret 302s (files kept by the FBI documenting interviews with their informants) showing that John Gotti Jr, the man who had stood by him when he married his first wife in 1998, was 'a super-rat'. And everything changed. Boss: John Gotti, also known as The Dapper Don, who was at the head of the Gambino crime family. But Alite says that ultimately he and his son proved to be liars ad not men of honor . Friends turned enemies: John Gotti Jr (center) and John Alite (left) as friends in the mid-1980s. But they are now enemies, with Alite having given evidence against Gotti, who Alite says was himself a rat . According to Alite, he realized that he had bought into a lie – the 'seductive image' was just that, an image. The Gottis – father and son – were not men of substance but cowards, sold out by their own lawyer who, Alite said, handed over the 302s to his contact. Alite cut his own deal. In 2008 he secretly pleaded guilty to two murders, four conspiracies to murder, at least eight shootings and two attempted shootings as well as armed home invasions and armed robberies in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida. He testified in the trial of Gambino family enforcer Charles Carneglia – now serving a life sentence for four murders. He went onto testify against Gotti but after 11 days of deliberations the jury came back deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. The jury stated that they hadn't trusted prosecution witnesses – especially Alite. On April 26, 2011 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released in 2013 having served six since his extradition. John Gotti Jr's role as an FBI informant has since emerged publicly but, much to Alite's, frustration it has gained fewer column inches than he feels it deserves and he rails against the fact that Gotti Jr's claim that he left the mob of his own volition is rarely publicly challenged. He said: 'In 1999 he claims he retired. In 2001 he gets caught on tape mad that his uncle brought him down from boss to skipper. In 2005 he gets caught co-operating. They shelve him. Meaning he was thrown out of the mob. 'There is no such thing as quitting. There's no two weeks' notice and there's no pension.' According to Alite, for whom this is all deeply personal, anything that preserves Gotti Jr's image is 'glorifying the mob.' He said, 'If you're glorifying the mob you're killing kids. You're teaching kids to respect the wrong thing. You're teaching them to respect a coward.' At 52 Alite still carries himself like the wise guy mobster he once was. He is physically fit, heavily tattooed and charismatic. He's the real deal and dangerously close to glamorizing the very thing against which he is speaking out by virtue of his own charm. But he insisted, 'I'm not proud of what I did. I lived then as if I was at war. I was like an alcoholic with violence. Now I'm not like that. Now I'm a little more controlled.' Now the services he offers are strictly cerebral. With 'Scared Straight and At Risk Youth' talks he draws on his own credibility as a mobster to dismantle any lingering delusions that there is anything glamorous or desirable about that life. Regrets: Alite has four grown-up children and says that he regrets not being a part of their lives as much as he should have been because of time spent behind bars . Mafia presence: John Gotti was at the head of the Gambino crime family and John Alite's boss. but now that the former mob henchman has gone straight he says: ' I'm doing it the right way.' He said, 'If I go into a juvenile center and talk to 300 kids ages 12 to 17 then I'm not going to reach all 300, but maybe I can reach one or five or 10. And I'll tell you now if I go in and talk to them or if a psychologist does this talk, they're going to listen to me, there's the difference.' Similarly the man who once prided himself on being the consummate predator is now offering his wisdom in anti-bullying speeches. He explained, 'Being a victim or not being a victim is all about the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you carry yourself. Same thing in the prison system. And a predator in those situations, in the street or in jail, they can sense it, they can feel it. 'You can fool someone who's not a gangster. John Gotti Jr could walk into this room and fool someone who's not a street guy. 'But take a street guy, a real tough guy and they can read through all his b*****t. You can't fake it. But you can learn it.' Once a millionaire many times over Alite was financially successful – legally and illegally – because, he said, he was 'aggressive'. When speaking to corporate clients he can offer 'experience beyond anybody's education.' And few can lay claim to inspiring the level of respect he once held, something, he insisted that has nothing to do with fear and everything to do with credibility. For his own part Alite is not without regrets. As a father of four adult children ages 18 to 25 he admitted: 'I feel really bad for my kids because I wasn't there for them because of my crazy lifestyle.' 'But,' he said, 'at some point in your life you have to take blame for what you did: right, wrong or indifferent. When someone says they don't feel guilt I think they're a liar or a sociopath. 'Truthfully at the time I thought I was invincible. Now I don't sleep well. I go to therapy all the time and it's a constant work in progress. 'Of course I miss the money. Of course I miss that I was a big shot. I'm like everybody else. I want to get the clothes, the nice things, but it's not worth it. Before I didn't care how I got it. 'Now, I don't want to lose direction and become the person I used to be. This is the hardest time I've ever had – trying to reinvent myself but I'm doing it through hard work, I'm doing it the right way.' For more information go to www.johnalite.com .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Sailing around the world is one of the most grueling challenges on the planet, with muscle-bound skippers steering 20-meter yachts through everything from tropical cyclones to Antarctic storms. Forced to endure the most brutal conditions on the globe, sailors must not only be emotionally resilient -- but physical dynamos. Which raises the question: Are women -- the stereotypical \"weaker gender\" -- up to the task? Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade. This one's for you . It will be an emotional campaign by the 11-woman Swedish Team (SCA), who last month lost their coach Magnus Olsson to a stroke. \"People say it's the toughest race there is in the world but it's much more than that. It's big waves, icebergs, it's incredible team spirit. You want to win but of course you have bad days and sometimes you hate it,\" Swedish veteran sailor Olsson told CNN, before his death. \"This race is incredibly physical. The stronger you are the better it is -- you get an advantage over the others if you are stronger for sure.\" Everest of sailing . The all-women team will be allowed three more sailors than their male counterparts, in their bid to win one of the toughest sporting competitions in the world. Dubbed the \"Everest of Sailing,\" the Volvo Ocean Race covers 72,000-kilometers in an epic nine-month journey across the globe. Launched in 1973, the race claimed three lives in the first year alone. \"It's very physical and it's definitely become a lot more physical over the years --the sails are getting bigger, the boats are going faster,\" three-time race winner, Brad Jackson, told CNN. \"It's just harder work, so the more big guys the better.\" Women doing it for themselves . The last time an all-female crew took part was in 1997, finishing ninth out of 10 boats. This time around, the ladies are more determined than ever to cross the finish line first, and are busy training in Lanzarote, Spain, more than a year ahead of the race in October, 2014. Five of the crew have already been chosen, and include an elite line-up of former Olympic competitors and international world champions. Among them is Briton Sam Davies, who in 2008 finished fourth in the Vendee Globe -- a non-stop, solo circumnavigation renowned as the toughest sailing competition on the planet. The 38-year-old's most recent attempt at the Vendee earlier this year lasted just six days, after her mast collapsed. The crushing disappointment forced her to look for a new challenge. \"When something unexpected and unwanted happens it's really hard. You always have to learn from your mistakes and learn by your problems and come out stronger and so that's what I'm doing,\" Davies told CNN. \"The VendÄ—e Globe is my project, I'm my own boss and I do everything on the boat. There are so many things that I have been questioning -- such as whether I'm capable of getting into a project where I'm not the boss anymore,\" the mother-of-one added. From heartbreak to hero? Also in the crew is another yachtswoman reeling from professional disaster, and hoping to make good in 2014. A year ago, 33-year-old Annie Lush was training for the London 2012 Olympics with only one thing on her mind -- to win a medal. But her three-person-crew, who had won a world title in their Olympic build up, did not deliver, instead finishing sixth. \"I don't think I'll ever forget that moment,\" Lush told CNN. \"I had a lot of belief in the way we campaigned but it was one of our worst ever performances in a regatta. \" \"That disappointment will always be with me. I've chosen not to go back and try and settle that straight, but to do something new and this is something new.\" Future females . One thing is for sure, win or lose, these gutsy ladies are throwing sailing stereotypes overboard. As SCA managing director, Richard Brisius, said: \"They are all very talented natural sailors -- gender does not come into it.\" \"It would be great to think that we could engage a new generation of women to break into competitive, crewed offshore racing. A female team in this race should be the norm, not something unusual.\"",

        "document": "With their trademark maroon berets, the soldiers from this elite regiment pride themselves on being the fittest of the fit. Which is why those wanting to join the British Army's Parachute Regiment have to pass one of toughest job interviews imaginable. The  28-week training course which must be passed in order to become a Paratrooper has become famous within the forces for its sheer intensity. Now, for the first time in 30 years, camera crews have gone inside the regiment's training camp to follows the fresh-faced recruits as they find out what it takes to earn the coveted maroon beret. Scroll down for videos . A seven-part series, due to air tomorrow, follows fresh-faced recruits as they attempt to survive the gruelling 28-week training course to earn a place in the British Army's Parachute Regiment . For the seven-part series, the cameras follow a platoon of young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their final Pass Out Parade seven months later. When filming began there were 34 recruits - but by the end of the course, only eight of those are left to take their first step into the British Army. The fly-on-the-wall footage, called Para Platoon: Earning the maroon beret, also includes an in-depth look at 'P Company', the famously gruelling final test which makes or breaks the strongest of recruits. The eight tests which make up P Company include the stretcher race – in which recruits carry a metal stretcher weighing almost 180lbs over five miles – and the 60ft high aerial assault course, designed to see if the men can jump out of an airplane. During the episodes, the wannabe soldiers are seen physically retching as they test their physical limits. They are pushed to the point of exhaustion as they are filmed wading through knee-deep water and clambering over giant obstacles - only to be told to get up and start all over again. More than anything, the course is the chance to 'take the civilian head off their shoulders for three and put them into a military environment'. And, if they succeed in doing that, the rewards are huge. In the first episode, the men are shown arriving at Catterick Garrison - where the British Army trains all its infantry recruits -  for their Parachute Regiment Assessment Course. The PRAC is an initial three-day test to see whether or not the men have the endurance to take on the full 28-week training course. Course commander Corporal Rob Price, who has done three tours of Afghanistan, puts the men through their paces using a series of tough physical assessments, designed to assess their fitness and determination. For the first time in 30 years, cameras have gone inside the training camp to document the young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their Pass Out Parade, seven months later . But - incase they ever dare start to get ahead of themselves - the men are constantly reminded how far they have to go: 'You are not paratroopers yet, gents. You are far from that,' they are told. Explaining why the course is so tough, Corporal Price tells the camera: 'We don't go looking for these recruits. These recruits come to us. You either want to be here or you don't. 'If you don't, no problem to us, we will leave you where you are. But if you want to be here, you want to be part of the best regiment, you've got to step up to the task. The recruits' first day is a snapshot of what is to come. The men must complete a physical fitness assessment - including 48 sit ups and 48 press ups in two minutes - as well as a 1.5mile run in less than ten minutes. Some of the tough obstacles which the men have to complete include a steeplechase, dotted with tough obstacles (right) and swathes of muddy water (left) They are also expected to complete a two-mile steeplechase - dotted with tough obstacles and swathes of muddy water - in less than 21 minutes. Coporal Price tells the camera that, apart from wading through deep water against the clock, the men will be ruined from the blisters they sustain by running for probably the first-time ever in chunky army boots. And it's that event which claims the first casualty of the course, who is seen slumped against the wall, shattered and half-broken. But the men barely have a second to get over their exhaustion, being told to 'stop feeling sorry for themselves' because it is 'the easiest event in the world'. The recruits are then made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain. Corporal Price explains the lengths that some recruits have gone to, in a bid to ensure they pass the test. He said: 'You have got to pour blood, sweat, tears to get up it. We have had guys that have been crawling up it, trying to get up there with their nails just to get up the top of it. 'We are not setting them up for it, we are just setting up to see if they can do it.' The recruits are also made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain, which the course commander said you have to 'pour blood, sweat, tears to get up' The recruits are also put through the trainasium - a 60ft training assault, unique to the regiment. Expected to run and jump at heights, the event simulates the so-called exit phase of a parachute jump. Corporal Price explains: 'It is the event that conquers your fear of heights. You can either do it, or you can't. 'If you can't do a 60ft beam walk in the air, there is no way you will be jumping out of a Hercules C13 at 800ft. There's just no way.' The documentary follows the journey of some of the individuals who have embarked on the course, who come from all walks of life. There's a 26-year-old who used to be a support worker competing side-by-side with a man who is trying his luck for the second time, after leaving the army, aged 16. Corporal Price said there are several soldiers who comes from difficult backgrounds, who want to join the Parachute Regiment to better themselves. Another of the challenges involving boxing with one another - something which causes many recruits to fall at the final hurdle . Meanwhile, Private Phil Howard explains how he gave up the chance of going to university to take a shot at the course. He said: 'I always wanted to do it since I was tiny. I always wanted to join the army. I joined because I wanted to make a difference and to have a bit of meaning. I wanted to join the Paras because it is the elite unit.' And for Private Michael Coates, who worked as a support worker with those with learning difficulties, joining the Paras is a way of escaping his mundane life on 'Civvy Street'. He said: 'When you're on Civvy Street, you feel like you're doing nowt, not achieving nowt. 'If you want to do something remarkable with your life, because you're only living it once.' The Parachute Regiment is the airborne infantry element of 16 Air Assault Brigade. It is an infantry force with expertise air-land deployments, by helicopter, airplane or parachute. It is also trained to provide direct support to United Kingdom Special Forces, with whom it maintains close links. The regiment was created after Winston Churchill, speaking in June 1940, called for the formation of an elite Corps of troops, of at least 5,000 parachute troops. A Parachute Training School was established at Ringway Airport, near Manchester. By the end of the Second World War, the regiment comprised of 17 battalions. The regiment wore the maroon beret and the nickname 'red devils' was bestowed by the enemy forces during fierce fighting in North Africa. Following many famous operations during the war, the Parachute Regiment went on to serve everywhere from Palestine to Northern Ireland to the Falklands. More recently, the regiment led in war-torn Kosovo and Sierra Leone. The regiment is made up of 1 PARA, which forms the Special forces Support Group (SFSG); 2 PARA, which forms part of 16 Air Assault Brigade and is based in Colchester, Essex; 3 PARA and 4 PARA, the reserve parachute battalion with its headquarters in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. Another would-be soldier tells the cameras how he failed a selection course for the Royal Marines 'by a fingernail'. But, three years on, he has grown tired of his everyday life. He said: 'I got sick to death of it. I want to proper money, proper mates and get a proper family about us.' The comradeship is also something hammered home throughout the episodes. Corporal Price said: 'Once you are in the reg, you are in the reg for life, you will need no other family once you're in here. 'It's hard to say, because I love my family as well and the majority of the guys will say that again, but being with the blokes - your guys, your men, your muckers - there's no feeling like it. 'If someone is in trouble, guys will bust a gut to help you.' PARA Platoon: Earning the Maroon Beret is on Forces TV (SKY 264, Virgin 244, Freesat 652) tomorrow at 9pm.",

        "document": "London (CNN) -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday, as the EU's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as \"unacceptable.\" Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas, forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey. \"I am extremely concerned about the level of disruption to travel across Europe caused by severe snow. It is unacceptable and should not happen again,\" European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said in a written statement. He took issue with airport infrastructure which he called the \"weak link\" in the chain, and urged airports to \"get serious\" about planning for severe weather conditions. Thousands of passengers endured another frustrating day at London's Heathrow Airport Tuesday as airlines struggled to clear the backlog of passengers after two days of cancellations. Only one of the airport's two runways was operating, following cancellations during the previous two days due to heavy snow. British Prime Minister David Cameron discussed the weather chaos with his cabinet \"extensively\" Tuesday, according to his office. \"The people stuck here are having an incredibly difficult time, especially just a few days from Christmas, and everything must be done to either get them on holiday or get them home safely,\" Cameron said at a news conference. Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late Saturday. \"We got told on that evening that if we waited until 6 a.m. the next morning we'd get more information. We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1:30 a.m. in the morning,\" she said. Conditions hadn't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight. \"We're younger, we've got resistance, but there are babies, there are elderly people, and they're getting no extra treatment than anyone else. It's disgusting,\" she said. On Tuesday afternoon, British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports. Terminal five, it said, had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse. London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours, British Airways said, adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load. Gatwick airport officials indicated Tuesday evening that operations were nearing normal. Nearly 700 flights were scheduled to arrive or depart the airport Tuesday carrying about 100,000 passengers, an airport spokeswoman said, and only 53 flights had been canceled. \"The airfield teams are continuing  to work round the clock and we are in a strong position to get flights moving to as near normal operations later today,\" Gatwick spokeswoman Andrea Hopkins said. The airport has requested additional snow-clearing equipment to be delivered from Switzerland in an effort to make operations fully functional. Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix, Arizona, after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich, Germany. They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday. \"We really felt that we were flying into the eye of the storm and it didn't make much sense to do that, but here we are. We've been told our best chance of getting out is on December 27,\" Sharon said. The colleagues say they are \"lucky\" to be put up in a hotel by their company, and expressed sympathy for others stranded in the airport with little or no information, accommodation or money. \"It looks like a refugee camp. People have been staying there for days,\" Sharon said. \"There were guards at the doors of Terminal One not allowing other people to come in. We were a little concerned about leaving the terminal that we might not be able to get back in.\" The British government has come under fire for failing to heed warnings about the incoming inclement weather. Defending the government, UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said, \"Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we've had.\" He laid the blame for chaos at Heathrow Airport firmly at the door of airport operator BAA who he said made a \"bad call\" on Saturday when the snow first started to present problems. \"This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was, as it turned out, over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open,\" he said. The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected, Hammond said. He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating. British transport expert David Quarmby, author of an independent audit on the resilience of England's transport system, said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall. \"We had a severe winter last winter and a bit of a winter the year before. But for eight years before that we hardly saw any snow at all,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we've got at the moment.\" The travel disruption was not limited to airports. Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London on Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains, or about 20% of its normal service between London and Paris. \"Due to the continuing bad weather, speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines, adding up to two hours to journey times. As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned,\" said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh. Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure. Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal. During the wait, they were offered pizza, curry, coffee and tea, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. Earlier, hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations, including Eurostar's Paris terminal, Monday night while they waited news of the next train, French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday. Around 3,000 passengers on cancelled flights slept on the floor at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, while another 400 spent the night at Orly airport, she said. Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, CEO of Air France KLM said efforts had been made to find stranded passengers a hotel room. \"We found 4,000, but we couldn't find anymore,\" Gourgeon told French radio. A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was \"slowly resuming\" after severe snow disruptions. Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport. Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday, said Thomas Uber, an airport spokesman. By mid-morning in Europe, the number of canceled flights had risen to 464, mostly due to backlogs and disruptions at other airports, an official said. About 50 flights had been canceled at Munich airport, also due to disruptions elsewhere. German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports. Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies. On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London. In a statement posted on its website, the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car. European Commission Vice President Kallas said he would convene a meeting of European airport representatives in coming days to demand an explanation and assurances that they can handle future snow disruptions. \"We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance. Better preparedness, in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra, it must be planned for and with the necessary investment, particularly on the side of the airports,\" he said. The UK's Met Office, the country's weather forecasting agency, said it is not expecting further snow in London on Wednesday and that Heathrow and Gatwick airports \"should remain dry.\" CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Fred Pleitgen, Phil Han and Jim Boulden contributed to this report .",

        "document": "Southampton climbed to third in the Premier League on Sunday night after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford as Ronald Koeman's side continues to defy the odds in their chase for Champions League football. The Dutchman has rightly taken the plaudits for exceeding all expectations after the club made wholesale in the summer. But who makes up Koeman's backroom staff? Here, Sportsmail gives you the low-down on the men working miracles behind the scenes at St Mary's. Southapton's first team staff (left to right) Sammy Lee, Martin Hunter, Erwin Koeman, Dave Watson, Ronald Koeman and Jan Kluitenberg pose for a picture at the beginning of the season . ERWIN KOEMAN . Role: Assistant manager . Erwin Koeman is the older brother of manager Ronald and the pair teamed up in the summer to take charge of Southampton after managing against each other in the Dutch league. Erwin managed RKC Waalwijk for two seasons - where he locked horns with Ronald, who was manager of Feyenoord - before joining his brother at St Mary's after leading the club to relegation last season. It is the first time the brothers have coached together and Erwin said his late father Martin, who died in 2013, would have been pleased: 'We once said we would be good to work together, but my father also said it would be fantastic if we could be a duo. Unfortunately he won't experience it but I am sure he would really like it.' Erwin, like Ronald, began his playing career at Groningen - the brothers spent one season together at the Dutch side in 1982-83 - before representing PSV and KV Mechelen in Belgium. Erwin also lined up alongside his brother for Holland. The Southampton assistant earned 31 caps for the national side and was part of the team that won the 1988 European Championships. Erwin Koeman is a former manager in the Dutch league and teamed up with brother Ronald at Southampton to coach together for the first time . Erwin and Ronald take their seats for Southampton's Premier League clash with Manchester City in November . JAN KLUITENBERG . Role: First team coach . Jan Kluitenberg followed Koeman to Southampton in the summer after working under him at Feyenoord. The duo also enjoyed spells together at AZ Alkmaar and Benfica. Kluitenberg's role at Southampton is to  ensure the players reach peak physical fitness and is responsible for devising individual training programmes to ensure maximum physical output and prevention of injuries. Having worked with him at three previous clubs, Koeman clearly has trust in Kluitenberg's methods and after Sunday's 1-0 win at Old Trafford, where Saints produced a perfectly executed high pressing performance, it would be hard to argue with his techniques. Jan Kluitenberg has worked with Koeman at three other clubs including Feynoord and AZ Alkmaar . SAMMY LEE . Role: First team assistant coach . Sammy Lee spent 12 years as a Liverpool player in the 1970s and 80s winning three consecutive league titles and three European Cups during a golden era for the club. Lee began his coaching career at the Merseyside club, too, where he spent another 11 years at Liverpool working under Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier before moving on after the appointment of Rafa Benitez. Lee then moved to Bolton and became Sam Allardyce's assistant - where he was affectionately known as 'Little Sam' - and even enjoyed a short spell in charge of the north-west club. The 58-year-old also coached England for five years during Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign between 2001 and 2006, before further spells at Liverpool and Bolton. Lee left his role as head of academy coaching at Wanderers to link up with Koeman at Southampton, with the club hoping to tap into more than 20 years of coaching experience. Sammy Lee won three league titles and three European Cups as a player at Liverpool . MARTIN HUNTER . Role: Technical director: . Martin Hunter began his career as a PE and Geography teacher at Bridgewater Hall School in Milton Keynes, before working as assistant manager at Bradford and Stoke. Hunter then spent 13 years as a coach at the FA, where he worked with England Under 15s, Under 16s and Under 19s and helped bring through the likes of Joe Cole, Theo Walcott and Michael Carrick into the senior team. Hunter went on to work at Norwich and Watford - where he played an active role alongside Malky Mackay - before returning to Bradford for a short spell in 2010. He then moved to Southampton in July 2010 as under 21 coach before moving into his role as technical director, where he has played a key role in bringing through players from the youth academy. In a recent interview with the Telegraph Hunter described the 'Southampton way': 'We tell the coaches we want three things in the session: we want players coming off sweating with a smile on their faces and to have learned something.' Assistant first team coach Lee issues instructions from the touchline . DAVE WATSON . Role: Senior goalkeeping coach . Dave Watson made more than 200 appearances for his hometown club Barnsley before his playing career was curtailed by a serious knee injury that he wasn't able to recover from. Watson hung up his gloves in 2001 at just 28 before embarking on a coaching career that began at Northampton and took him to Oldham and Huddersfield. Watson then worked with the England Under 19s, where he enhanced his reputation after assisting in the development of Joe Hart, Ben Foster and Jack Butland at international level. His work didn't go unnoticed ans Watson was invited by senior manager Roy Hodgson to work alongside Ray Clemence at Euro 2012, before taking up a role at Norwich. Leaving Norwich after their  relegation to the Championship last season, Watson joined the staff at Southampton and has helped Fraser Forster make the seamless transition to Premier League football. Goalkeeping coach Dave Watson and Koeman get their point across to the players . PS LES REED . Role: Executive director . Les Reed began his career as a coach in non-League before spending time coaching in the FA becoming director of technical development, overseeing the development of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Reed is most famous for a disastrous spell in charge of Charlton Athletic after taking over from Iain Dowie in November, 2006. Reed lasted in the job just six weeks, managing one victory and suffered the embarrassment of being knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Wycombe. The ill-fated reign led to Reed being attacked in the media and he developed the unwanted nickname 'Les Miserables'. He left by mutual consent in December. Reed joined Southampton in 2010 as head of football development and was in charge of overseeing the youth academy, scouting and recruitment, sports medicine and science, and kit and equipment management.",

Aleksey Vayner passed away at the age of 29, according to the New York City Medical Examiner -  and reports from relatives suggest that he may have experienced a drug overdose. On Jan. 18, the night before his death, a friend wrote on Vayner's Facebook wall, 'Do not, anyone, sell this idiot ANY pills!.' This rest of the post is written in Russian and says, 'Damned egoist, pick up the phone, who's going to take care of mom? [you could] sell your source code and f**k off to costa rica. [even] paypal would pay you 2-3 hundred thousand. pick up the phone, bastard.' In response, just before midnight, Vayner angrily wrote back to his Facebook friend by responding 'Volodia, go to hell' in Cyrillic. A spokesman for the medical examiner told Ivygate that a man matching Vayner's description under the name of Alex Stone died at 8 a.m. on January 19th at Jamaica Hospital, Queens. She said the cause of death was still to be determined and the autopsy will take several weeks. 'It looks like he took some drugs or medicine, had a heart attack, a friend of his drove him to the hospital, and they couldn't resuscitate him,' said Boris Vayner, who identified himself as Aleksey's step-cousin to Gawker.com . 'Not exactly sure though, I'm too far away.' Public records seen by the MailOnline confirm that Vayner had changed his name in April 2012. It is believed that he decided to go under the name of Alex Stone after the video resume he sent to UBS for an investment banking job in 2006 went viral online and was mocked by millions. In the video, titled 'Impossible is Nothing,' a gravely serious Vayner attempts to prove his mental and physical fitness by talking about the meaning of success while lifting 495-pound weights, smacking tennis balls faster than 140 miles per hour, ball-dancing with a scantily-clad woman and breaking seven bricks with his hand. 'Ignore the losers, bring your A-game, your determination and your drive to the field, and the success will follow you,' he says in the video. The video was forwarded around Wall Street and quickly went viral. The Facebook posting to Aleksey's page the evening before his death that begins with a warning in English and carries on in Russian to ask him 'who's going to take care of your mom?' Vayner said his physical fitness was a testament to his mental stamina . The New York Times called it 'The Resume Mocked 'Round the World,' and Vayner told the newspaper that he thought he might never get a job in the financial industry as a result of the video's popularity. While the video became the laughing stock of Wall Street, Vayner said he was not amused. 'He said he feels like a victim,' the Times reported in October 2006, three months after the video was recorded. 'The job materials that were leaked and posted for public view included detailed information about him that allowed strangers to scrutinize and harass him, he said.' Even before he arrived as a freshman at Yale, Vayner had become known for exaggerating his own feats. At a 2002 event in New Haven for high-school seniors who have been admitted to Yale, Vayner told current students all about his abilities and specialised skills. He told Jordan Bassm a freshman student at the Ivy League college that he had taught tennis to Jerry Seinfeld and Harrison Ford and that the Dalai Lama had apparently written his college recommendation. Vayner included clips of himself skiing and chopping bricks in half with his palm . Vayner shows off his tennis skills in the video that he sent to UBS for an investment banking job . 'He talked for, like, six hours straight the first night,' said Bass to the New Yorker magazine after they investigated Vayner in 2006 following his notorious video job application. 'He had a lot of affiliations with élite institutions. He was an action star, an espionage expert, and a professional athlete. He would be on the C.I.A. firing range one day and, the next, at a martial-arts competition that took place in this secret system of tunnels underneath Woodstock, New York. 'Then he was at a skiing competition in Switzerland. He told us the Russian Mafia had him forging passports.' Struck by the outlandish claims of the prospective student, student journalist Bass investigated and eventually wrote a title for the Yale campus tabloid entitled 'CRAAZY PREFROSH LIES, IS JUST WEIRD'. Attending Yale despite the attention of the article, Vayner arrived with a CV that now boasted he had begun modelling for the price of $200 an hour, written a book about the Holocaust and founded a charity for troubled children. He also claimed to have won two tennis matches against Pete Sampras, retired from professional martial arts and mastered the art of 'bone setting'. Aleksey Vayner with an unidentified woman who is believed to be his wife . As an undergraduate at Yale - Aleksey made outlandish claims about his social and academic prowess that he included in his now notorious Impossible is Nothing video résumé . These amazing claims informed part of Vayner's video résumé which he sent to UBS and included the further claims that he was a an international rumba dancing specialist and could split a stack of bricks with his bare hands. Today, Vayner is listed online as the manager of a company called Ultimate Success Systems, LLC, and a nonprofit called Empower a Child.' It has also been reported that Vayner may have been married at some point. He has maintained a YouTube channel where he posts videos of himself performing athletic feats, such as punching through a block of wood and cracking bricks with his palm. In an interview from 2010 with motherboard.vice.com, Vayner described how the spread of his video had . made him feel 'like that Star Wars Kid' - referring to Ghyslain Raza, . the Canadian boy who had to seek therapy after a secret video of him playing . with a mock light sabre turned him into a laughing stock. 'I hit rock bottom.' The videoed interview took place at ROFLCon . during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, . martial arts, tennis and Buddhism. Aleksey Vayner at ROFLCon during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, martial arts, tennis and Buddhism . The news of Vayner's passing was first announced in an email to a group of his friends from Yale - which has been seen by the MailOnline. According to the email, his sister, Tamara and mother, also called Tamara are devastated by the news and are planning a memorial service for January 26th in New York. The author of the email recounted how when he last saw Vayner in December, he was applying to law school, coaching tennis, in good spirits and looking forward to the future. In his cover letter to UBS, Vayner said 'as a world-level athlete in several sports, I have developed an insatiable appetite for peak performance and continuous learning.' On his resume, Vayner cited  experience as an investment adviser at a firm called Vayner Capital Management. He also claimed he did charity work at an organization called Youth Empowerment Strategies. The websites for both of the companies went dark shortly after his video resume went viral, however, and there was no evidence that either of the organizations was legitimate. Arriving in New York from Uzbekistan with his mother at a young age, Vayner had recently started his own company and was trying to recover from the debacle his video resume had caused him. UBS’sreputation as one of the top investment management firms in the world motivates me to consider a career with your firm. The fast-paced environment and focus on results and excellence that define UBS would be an ideal place for me in terms of both personality and skills. I strive in intense, competitive environments. As a world-level athlete in several sports, I have developed an insatiable appetite for peak performance and continuous learning. My trainer and world martial arts champion often said, “Impossible is just someone’s opinion.” I live by those words. My unique mix of previous work experience and my record as a professional athlete demonstrate a level of focus, a pattern of setting and achieving objectives, as well as adaptation to change. I live everyday with passion because I embrace change as a daily challenge. Nothing will prevail over genuine human relations because we succeed as a team, or we fail as individuals. The skills outlined on my attached resume, along with my work experience, CFP and RIA certifications demonstrate my aptitude in finance. These skills and the personal qualities and beliefs I bring to my work fit well with UBS work ethic and make me an ideal candidate for a career with UBS. I would welcome the occasion to further discuss career opportunities with UBS, and Iook forward to hearing from you soon.

        "document": "Kristina Chesterman, a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was killed by a suspected drunken driver last year before she ever got a chance to travel, learn how to fly a plane or ride a camel. But now Susan Vieria, 64, has made a commitment to fulfill all the wishes on the bucket list of the young woman whose heart is beating in her chest. Chesterman, from Livermore, was left brain dead after a car operated by 19-year-old Riley Hoover slammed into her bike just a block from her home near Chico State University campus last September. Unbreakable bond: Kristina Chesterman (left), a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was an organ donor, so when she was killed in a horrific DUI crash last year, her heart went to 64-year-old Susan Vieria (right) Scene: Her destroyed bike (pictured) was carried for another 200 feet by a suspected 19-year-old drunken driver . The beautiful college sophomore was studying to be a nurse because she wanted to save lives, and she was also a registered organ donor - a decision that ended up giving at least five people, Vieria among them, a second chance. Three days after Chesterman’s horrific accident, the 64-year-old South Bay resident, who had suffered congestive heart failure, got a call from Stanford University Hospital saying that a match has been found. ‘I never dreamed in my life, how they would remedy my heart,’ Vieira told the station KCRC. Later that same night, Vieria underwent a successful heart transplant. With her health on the mend, Vieria took to Facebook in order to find her donor's family and express her gratitude for Chesterman's selfless act. The 64-year-old woman and Chesterman's mother, Sandra, met face to face for the first time two weeks ago. Life saver: Kristina Chesterman (right) studied nursing at Chico State University and was committed to helping others any way she could . Second chances: A portion of Chesterman's liver went to a baby boy (left), and one of her kidney's was donated to family friend Sakariah Pappachan (right) ‘I felt an instant connection,’ Sandra Chesterman said. ‘I felt that I've known her for a long time. I felt comfortable right away. Even on the phone talking to her, I felt a connection.’ Although she is in her golden years, Vieria has vowed to Kristina's family that as long as she is physically capable, she will do all the things their daughter had aspired to do in her lifetime. According to the late student's mother, some of the items on Kristina’s extensive bucket list were learning how to pilot a plane, travel around the world and ride a camel. ‘Kristina's waiting there to advise me,’ Miss Vieria said while sitting next to her donor’s mother. According to San Jose Mercury News, the young woman also dreamed of running through a poppy field and flying in a hot-air balloon. Besides Vieria, Chesterman has given a new lease on life to four other people, including two babies, one of whom got a portion of her liver, and family friend Sakariah Pappachan, who received a kidney. Daughter's wish list: Kristina's mother, Sandra Chesterman (right) told Vieria (left) that the 21-year-old wanted to learn how to fly a plane, ride a camel, travel, run through a poppy field and fly in a hot-air balloon . Heart to heart: Mrs Chesterman said she felt instant connection with the elderly woman who now has her daughter's heart beating in her chest . Sandra Chesterman told the paper in February that ever since she was a little girl, Kristina was passionate about helping others. She often donated blood, and at age 18, she registered as an organ donor because it was ‘the right thing to do.’ The student’s family are currently working on building a health clinic in Nigeria that will bear Kristina’s name. Meanwhile, her friends also have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, including skydiving, which Bridget Kline did over the ocean off San Diego recently. Another fiend Chris Leslie took Chesterman’s photo with him when he flew first-class to Japan - something she always wanted to do. Living out her fantasies: Kristina's friends have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, like sky-diving and flying first class . Still dreaming big: Chesterman's family are now building a health clinic in Nigeria in her name . ‘You wonder why someone like that is taken so young, but I believe Kristina was one of those very rare people who was so complete as a person already. ... The rest of us are just a work in progress,’ Leslie told the paper. Riley Hoover, the driver who crashed into Chesterman’s bike September 22, 2013, and then fled from the scene, is currently awaiting trial. He could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted of hit-and-run, DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter.",

Researchers at Yale University found pro athletes promoted 44 different food or beverage brands during 2010, with 79 percent of those food products being 'energy-dense and nutrient-poor.'

Bad role models: Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James, pictured, and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids . But the worst culprits were the most famous athletes, a fact that saddened health experts. Denver Broncos signal caller, Peyton Manning, has endorsement deals with Papa John's pizza and Oreo cookies, adding to the $12 million he makes annually from lending his face, voice and persuasive powers brands. According to Forbes, he even owns 21 Papa John's stores in the Denver area. Meanwhile, Miami Heat champion LeBron James earns $42 million per year by endorsing McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other products and number 3 on the researchers' list of stars who plug unhealthy products is tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who in the past has done ads for McDonald's and Oreo cookies. Pizza: Denver Broncos star Peyton Manning, left, stars in ads for Papa John's pizza and even owns a number of stores . Many of those food-and-beverage sales campaigns are aimed at young consumers, the study, which was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, found. 'When taking into account the nutrient quality of the products endorsed and the amount of advertising for each product, Peyton Manning, LeBron James, and Serena Williams are the highest contributors to the marketing of unhealthy foods,' the paper concluded. The authors said it 'ironic' that 'some of the world's most physically fit and well-known athletes' were promoting the unhealthy food and drinks and said it sends 'mixed messages about diet and health.' Unhealthy: Serena Williams, pictured, appears in an ad for Oreos licking the cream center . The study compared the modern day junk food flogging to the cigarette ads of sports stars like Babe Ruth and Ted Williams appeared in. The authors are urging the mega stars to re-think their decisions to push sugar-rich drinks or high-calorie foods. 'Our ultimate hope would be that athletes reject the unhealthy endorsements or, at the very least, promote healthy foods,' Yale University clinical psychology doctoral student and lead author in the study Marie Bragg told NBC News.

        "document": "(CNN) -- I strongly believe being mayor is the public post in which you have the greatest opportunity to change peoples' lives for the better. People live in cities, not states or nations. As a mayor, you are connected directly to citizens. And cities are increasingly the preferred place for most people to live. Today, half of the world's population is settled in urban areas. By 2050, seven out of 10 people will live in cities, according to United Nations projections. I like to say I have the best job in the world. Rio is an incredible place, a vibrant place, full of energy, culture and virtues. In the recent past, the city and its people seemed to be be headed down -- after 1960, Rio was was no longer the capital of Brazil and it faced economic difficulties and bad public management, which helped aggravate urban problems such as poverty and violence. Watch Eduardo Paes' TED Talk . But those days are over, and that's symbolized by the fact that Rio will host the fist Olympic Games in South America in 2016. It was not easy to get there. Our Olympic bid had to be selected over strong candidates such as Madrid, Tokyo and Chicago. But the International Olympic Commitee found our proposal was the one that would leave the greatest legacy. With dedication, inspiration and professionalism we have shown that things can be done. TED.com: Jaime Lerner sings of the city . Running a city is a great challenge. But it turns out that you don't have to be powerful or rich to be innovative and find good forms of urban development. I believe there are four basic commandments that serve as pillars for building a better city: . Commandment 1 -- A city of the future has to be environmentally friendly . Rio is an energetic, vibrant place, full of beauty and nature. But we face the kinds of problems any developing metropolis does -- with pollution, traffic congestion, poverty. Distribution of green areas, for example, is not uniform. Madureira, the heart of the suburb in Rio, is a concrete jungle. You have to find open spaces and make it so people can get to them. We are building the third-largest park in the city in Madureira, the temperature will drop 2 to 3 degrees centigrade. Every time you think of a city you have to think green, green, green. Commandment 2 -- A city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration . Cities are packed with people. How can you move people around effectively? High-capacity transportation usually requires a lot of money. A solution we found was Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), presented by a former mayor of Curitiba, Jaime Lerner. You transform a bus so that it functions virtually as a train car, with dedicated lanes and the same comfort and features as a subway station. A kilometer of BRT costs 10 times less than a subway and it gets built much faster. We will see the proportion of Rio's population served by high capacity transportation rise from 18% today to 63% by 2015. TED.com: Why the world needs charter cities . Commandment 3 -- A city of the future has to be socially integrated . In Rio, 1.4 million of the 6.3 million people live in favelas, or slums. They are all over the city but favelas are not always a problem -- sometimes they can be a solution, if you have the right public policies. What you need is to change from a vicious circle to a virtuous circle: Bring basic services inside the favelas with the same high quality you have in richer areas. The second aspect is to create open space in the favelas and develop infrastructure. By 2020, Rio aims to have all its favelas completely urbanized. Commandment 4 -- A city of the future has to use technology . We use technology to be flexible. In Rio we built a Center of Operations, a situation room that gathers information from municipal departments and allows us to manage and help decision-making. I can check the weather, the traffic and the location of city's waste collection trucks. Each of 4,000 buses in the city has a camera connected to the situation room.

        "document": "(CNN) -- Jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post, but they still train like athletes. When you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse. The riders, as well as their runners, follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well-balanced and healthy body. \"Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking,\" flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. \"Now we're at the peak of our fitness. It's definitely not just sitting on a horse!\" In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. Any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the British Horseracing Authority now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by Perham. Getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world's speediest steeds to the finish. The legs, lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training. Upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse. \"If you looked at a jockey without clothes on, there aren't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin,\" Perham told CNN. \"It's literally muscle and bone. Jockeys are incredibly well-toned athletes in the same way that Olympic champions Jessica Ennis or Mo Farah are.\" Racing fit . Jockey training is not for the faint of heart, or those who like a lie-in. Lane trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on Sunday mornings. \"I'm up around half past five or six most mornings,\" the 27-year-old explained. \"I'd then spend two and a half hours riding out. \"Then I'll have a cycle -- I ride 150 miles each week. The aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season. \"Before the season starts, I'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well. \"In the afternoons I go racing, and race riding keeps you pretty fit too.\" Jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the British Racing School's training suite in Newmarket. Here resident fitness coach Yariv Kam, a former basketball player, oversees bleep tests, squats (at the wall and standing on wobble cushions), timed sit-ups, push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank. All these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so-called \"Martini glass\" position. This precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills, and this is tested on the \"equisizer\" -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco. Complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket, the equisizer is a lifesize, legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. \"Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first,\" explained Perham. \"In the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time, a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance.\" One meal a day . Maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight. They are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements. In the U.S. and Great Britain, the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys. The majority are naturally slim and slight, so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss, although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds. \"I'm lucky that I can literally eat whatever I want and I won't get any heavier than 53 kg,\" explained Lane, who started riding when he was 12. \"But some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day. Mentally, it's a big task not to be eating.\" The British Racing School also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists. There is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie-counted recipes such as Mexican beans and rice, and spicy sausage hot pot. Not just about the horse . But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races? Perham concedes that the work level is split 90% to 10% in favor of the horse. But Lane, who has ridden more than 350 winners, believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit. \"People say, 'It's the horse, you just have to sit there,' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it,\" he reasoned. \"It may only be 10% us but if we're only 50% fit then the jockey can only commit 5% of the work during a race. \"If we're not as fit as we can be then we're definitely affecting the horse.\" As an example, he cited last weekend's Shergar Cup, a team event held at Britain's Ascot racecourse where jockeys compete for international teams. \"The English and European jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world. You could see at the finish they weren't as strong.\" To show how hard it is to train like a jockey, Perham put World Sport anchor Alex Thomas through his physical tests for CNN's Winning Post show. At the British Racing School, Thomas was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer. He also found he was no match for a professional jockey like Lane. In Perham's fitness assessment, Thomas managed to last 40 seconds in the sit-up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds, and while the average rider could stay in the stomach-clenching plank pose for 180 seconds, the journalist managed a third of that time. \"I knew it was going to be hard but I didn't think it would be that tough,\" Thomas grimaced at the end of his grueling physical. \"Safe to say, I won't be applying for my racing license anytime soon!\" All-round fitness . Not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey, but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred. \"The tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do,\" explained Perham. \"The simulator that I've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it's also very, very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment, similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer. It's an all-round fitness tool.\" While following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the Grand National or Breeders' Cup, Lane agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit. \"It's good for an all-round level of fitness,\" he added. \"Being fit makes everyday life so much easier.\"",

        "document": "By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 12:31 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:28 EST, 6 February 2014 . Tragic: Coporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire in 2011 . Colleagues of a soldier, who hanged herself two years after claiming she had been raped, released a box of live crickets in her room as part of a bullying campaign, an inquest has heard. Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement had 'cried rape'. Cpl Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury on October 9, 2011. Her sister, Sharon Hardy, has told the inquest that she had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision by military investigators not to prosecute the two soldiers who she claimed had raped her in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany. Cpl Berrill said Cpl Ellement had 'desperately' applied to be posted back to the UK after she had been 'bullied' by colleagues in Germany who accused her of 'crying rape'. Cpl Berrill, who became friends with her while they were posted together in Bulford, said that Cpl Ellement would describe how she had been targeted by other female soldiers in her barracks in Germany. She said: 'She had two pet bearded dragons, at one point, shortly after the rape allegation, she left the room to use the bathroom and a box of live crickets had been released in her room and they were everywhere. 'She told me she would get bangs on the door from the girls in the corridor and she said that Charlene (Pritchard) had said she had cried rape.' She continued: 'She said to me that she was no longer her usual bubbly self, she felt she couldn’t trust anybody, she didn’t want to go out anywhere because she felt she didn’t have any friends to go out with. 'She desperately wanted to come back on a compassionate and she was happy when she got that.' Cpl Pritchard denied when she gave evidence to the court that she banged doors or said to Cpl Ellement that she had cried rape. Her colleague Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, that the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Cpl Ellement (pictured) had 'cried rape' Cpl Berrill told the inquest that she had reprimanded a soldier, Corporal Craig O’Grady, for talking about the rape allegations at Bulford in April 2011. She said: 'I heard him saying she was a bitch and she had ruined his best friend’s life by crying rape. 'I confronted Cpl O’Grady and said that although everyone is entitled to an opinion, it’s not the kind of subject you should be talking about in a police station in front of other people who do not know what happened and you yourself do not know what happened. 'I thought is was highly unprofessional for somebody to talk about something so sensitive to people who had nothing to do with it.' She continued: 'I informed Anne-Marie about what I had heard and told her what Cpl O’Grady said, she was very upset about it and angry, she was clenching her fists a few times, her eyes welled up immediately.' Cpl Berrill said that she was then reprimanded by the regimental sergeant major for informing Cpl Ellement about the comments and relieved of her informal position of junior welfare officer. Tormented: Cpl Berill said Cpl Element (middle) had wanted to be posted back in the UK after suffering from 'bullying' in Germany . She said: 'He said I was professional and did the right thing at that stage by halting the conversation but I was unprofessional and had lost all the respect of my peers because I had told Anne-Marie what had happened.' Cpl Berrill thought 'it was not fair, ' and alleged there was 'no suggestion' the matter would be investigated. 'I knew there wasn’t anyone else she could turn to in the unit, if she lost her trust and confidence in me, she couldn’t talk to anybody,' she said. Cpl Berrill went on to say that Bulford had a 'horrible' working environment. She said: 'It’s not a very nice place, the camp itself is not in a good location, it’s isolated, it has its own weather system which makes it a more miserable place to be. 'As for the company, it wasn’t a nice place to work. Abuse: Other soldiers allegedly banged on Cpl Ellement's door (left) shouting that she had 'cried rape'. Cpl Berrill also claimed Cpl Charlene Pritchard (right) had told colleagues about the rape allegations . 'In my honest opinion, it didn’t feel comfortable, the working environment felt very seniors versus juniors, I didn’t feel like you could mix between the two.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was also singled out by physical training instructors who called her fat. She said: 'In several PT lessons, they would parade the fit people in one section and the unfit people, myself included, in another section. 'I can’t remember the exact words but they would say ‘the fit will be doing this PT, the sick, lame and lazy and the fat, you will be doing this PT’.' She said comments made about Cpl Ellement included: 'She was a bit fat, always downgraded.' 'In PT I heard her being treated differently, I heard the comments at PT.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was downgraded on her physical fitness report and that her ski-ing instructors had given her a 'hard time' on a recent trip. She said: 'I can’t recall exactly, she said to me that they had bullied her and victimised her by picking her out from the group.' Cpl Berrill told the hearing that she had been told of comments made by a superior officer on Facebook who had taken a file of Cpl Ellement’s work home to check it over. The comment, which did not name Cpl Ellement, said: 'I have seen better work from a child.' Family support: Anne Marie Ellement's sisters  Sharon Hardy (left), Khristina Swain (middle) and mother Alexandra Barritt arriving at the hearing . She said that she understood that the officer’s wife, who she believed worked as a primary school teacher, had also posted a comment on Facebook that 'the kids she teaches could do a better job.' Corporal Kareena Brooke told the inquest by phone-link from Diego Garcia that she had an argument with Cpl Ellement in the late spring of 2011 in which she was hit in the face with a bottle, although she was not injured. She said they were friends but they had been 'living in each other’s pockets too much' by the time of the incident as they had rooms facing each other in the barracks at Bulford. She said that they were in a group at a pub in Salisbury playing a game where they made each other’s drinks fizz over. She said that Cpl Ellement accidentally spilled her drink on her dress, which led to the argument in which she was hit with the bottle. Cpl Brooke said she did not know if it had been accidental or deliberate and did not make a formal complaint but did ask to move rooms. She denied that she attempted to turn people against Cpl Ellement following this incident. She said: 'I do not know why I would turn people against her. Me and Anne-Marie, we obviously didn’t get on for a while after this, she had been asking for the guys to lie for her after that night so I wasn’t happy about it. Accusations: Cpl Sarah Noteyoung leaving through the back door of the Coroner's office earlier this week. She is alleged to have vowed to make Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement's life hell after her boyfriend was accused of raping the Royal Military policewoman . 'I didn’t want to report it, I just wanted to move rooms.' Cpl Brooke told the inquest that Cpl Ellement was in a good mood when she celebrated her birthday a few days before her death. She said Cpl Ellement sang in a concert at a local village hall and they went on to a karaoke night in a pub in Amesbury. Cpl Brooke said: 'She just seemed happy and in really high spirits, like really proud.'I had never noticed if she was upset or anything that night, she seemed quite happy in herself.” Asked if she was aware of text messages sent to Cpl Ellement on the day of her death stating that her current boyfriend was ending their relationship, Cpl Brooke said: “I knew they had split, I do not know why, I cannot remember when I found out about it.' Deputy coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon Nicholas Rheinberg told the court that police had been informed of an allegation of interfering with a witness of the inquest.He said: 'The matter has been reported to the police for investigation. 'Should it be the case the culprit is discovered, it’s likely that very severe penalties would follow, not only for breaches of the criminal law but also contempt of court and, on the facts being proved, a term of imprisonment would be on the cards.'",

Shots are heard echoing through the halls of a former elementary school, yet teens inside are seen scurrying for cover. Others scream for help. 'For every second that goes by, I told you this, you are going to have dead children,' actor Steven Seagal addressed volunteers participating in a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona last February. The action start joined forces with 'America's Toughest Sheriff,' Joe Arpaio, for a training exercise on how to respond to a school shooting. It’s now being featured in a special for ABC’s Nightline. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Instructor: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, left, watches as actor and Maricopa County posse member Steven Seagal addresses the media about a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona in February . 'I am here to try to teach the posse firearms and martial arts to try to help them learn how to respond quicker and help protect our children,' Seagal said. It was one of many exercises as unique as Seagal's appearance himself that was undertaken by a small batch of the more than 3,000 - and said to be growing - members of the sheriff's school posse patrol. Arpaio enlisted Seagal to train his Maricopa County posse members with about 25 children between the ages of 14 and 18 used as stand-ins for scared students. Seen hiding under overturned tables or scrambling away from an entering gunman, the children did as they were told and screamed for help. To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used. Practice makes perfect: A young teen cowers under an overturned table during the simulation held in a former elementary school . Life-like: To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used . Purpose: The training, overseen by Seagal, was to help better prepare the sheriff's posse who are a collection of volunteers from the community hoping to take a stand against crime . 'In January, 2013, shortly after the Connecticut school shooting which left 26 people dead and the discovery here in Phoenix by Sheriff’s deputies of a high school student’s plans to kill fellow classmates in a local high school, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio launched a new program using his all-volunteer posse to patrol areas surrounding schools within his jurisdiction,' a press release for his program reads. Seagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work. For some, video covering the graphic scene, however safe, did little to comfort. 'Images of simulated student shootings in school hallways splashed across the media are terrifying and do nothing to further the serious discussions needed by responsible adults dedicated to humbly serving our communities,' Ginny Dickey, a Fountain Hills Councilwoman said in a statement in response. Protests: Some called Seagal's credentials 'ludicrous', two of his movie posters seen here, while others simply attacked the overly graphic exercise that involved children . Friends: Sheriff Joe Arpaio is seen introduced by Seagal during a campaign rally in Mesa, Arizona in 2012 . Arizona Democratic House Minority Leader Chad Campbell called the plan to use Seagal as an instructor 'ludicrous.' 'Steve Seagal is an actor. That's it. Why don't we also have Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris and Bruce Willis come out and train them too while we're at it,' Campbell said. 'I've put hundreds of thousands, if not millions of hours into my weapons training,' Segal addressed his credentials before the volunteers and media in February, a quote not missed by comedian Stephen Colbert. 'Now a million hours is technically 115 years, which sounds crazy, but then again so does asking Steven Seagal to train your posse,' he said on his program after. About a dozen people protested the event outside. 'No gun should ever be in a school,' said protester Cynthia Wharton, a Fountain Hills resident. Arpaio's 3,450-strong posse of unpaid men and women has for years helped the sheriff target drunken drivers and illegal immigrants, and chase down fathers who are behind on child support. Guides: Seagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 of Arpaio's volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work . 'It's important to help protect our children and our schools and we need to do that with whatever means we have,' said Rick Velotta, a posse member and retired General Electric manager who attended the training. Last year, Arpaio sent posse members to Hawaii to investigate the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate at the request of local Tea Party activists, a key Arpaio constituency. A sometime resident of the Phoenix Valley and member of Arpaio's posse, Seagal, 60, starred in big-budget films in the 1980s and early 1990s, earning a reputation as an action star in movies like 'Above the Law' and 'Under Siege.' He more recently played a corrupt Mexican drug lord in the 2010 film 'Machete.' Seagal also has been sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in a Texas county along the border with Mexico and appeared in a reality TV show detailing his work as a reserve deputy in New Orleans. On Wednesday Seagal appeared alongside President Vladimir Putin, overseeing a physical fitness program for Russia’s youth. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE: .",

        "document": "Editor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of \"Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City.\" Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Educator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators. (CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed? The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student! What have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show: . 1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level.  See details about K-12 schools, teachers » . 2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test. How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics? During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts. In 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students. Before I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area. Unfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham. When I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized. The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country. I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society. The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money? President Obama is moving in the \"right\" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools. Next time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district. Then you do the math. After all, it's your money they want to take. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Chavis.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- The steep rock walls of Thailand's Hellfire Pass symbolize the slavery, starvation, torture and lost lives of thousands of POWs and Asian civilians during World War II, when Japan forced them to build the infamous Death Railway to boost its invasion of Burma. At today's Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum, visitors can share the misery and memories of those years, and learn from survivors who tell what happened and why. Recently named the best museum in Thailand and ranked among the top five in Asia by TripAdvisor, the haunting site and museum are called a \"must\" by the travel website. Fifty miles away, in the town of Kanchanaburi (about 75 miles west of Bangkok, near Thailand's border with Myanmar), evocative ceremonies take place annually from November 28 to December 7 during River Kwai Bridge Week, commemorating the Allied bombing of the area, which began on November 28, 1944. Events include cultural performances, plus a sound and light show portraying the history of the Death Railway, which crossed the so-called Bridge on the River Kwai on its route through Hellfire Pass. More than 16,000 enslaved British, Dutch, Australian and American POWs perished at these sites. More than 90,000 Asians also died from starvation and disease during their forced labor, according to the United Kingdom's Forces War Records. Together, the sites make this corner of jungle in Thailand one of the most sobering and evocative places on the planet for travelers with an interest in the horrifying events of World War II. Fatal railway . \"Hellfire Pass\" and \"Death Railway\" are terms coined by POWs whose fate was sealed in a sinister, deadly agreement. In August 1942, Thailand's prime minister Field Marshal Phibun Songkhram signed an agreement with Japan to allow the laying of a single-meter-gauge railway track toward British colonial Burma (now Myanmar). In October 1943, Japan began transporting troops and supplies on that finished railway through newly carved Hellfire Pass, to support its 1942 Burma invasion. For slave labor, Tokyo used more than 60,000 POWs -- 30,000 British, 18,000 Dutch, 13,000 Australians and 700 Americans. Most were captured when Britain surrendered its colonial hold on Singapore in February 1942, while other POWs were seized in Britain's Malaysia and Dutch-held Indonesia. About one-fifth of the POWs died from untreated diseases and starvation -- they were given watery gruel rations and sadistic punishments while building Hellfire Pass and the Death Railway. Executions of prisoners and laborers were common. Tokyo was in a brutal rush, so its commanders in Thailand forced up to 180,000 Indians, Malayans, Singaporean Chinese, Tamils and other Asians to labor at the sites under similar conditions, according to the Forces War Records. The railway totaled 260 miles (415 kilometers), including 190 miles (304 kilometers) in Thailand from Nong Pladuk to Hellfire Pass on the Thai-Burma border, plus 70 miles (111 kilometers) to reach Thanbyuzayat inside Burma, where it linked trains to Rangoon. When the Allies began bombing the railway in November 1944 and 1945, they killed some POWs laboring there. Allied aerial bombing during 1945 also destroyed almost every railway bridge throughout Thailand. Some railroad tracks near Kanchanaburi survived the war, but Hellfire Pass disappeared amid jungle growth. Visiting Hellfire Pass . In the 1980s, a handful of Australian survivors rediscovered the overgrown Hellfire Pass section of the route and campaigned to turn it into a memorial. Guided tours are now available, but many people prefer to linger on their own. While most tourists visit the River Kwai bridge and main POW cemetery at Kanchanaburi, others say they experience stronger and more profound feelings at Hellfire Pass. Taxis and local buses are available between the sites. You can walk through Hellfire Pass's narrow 85-foot-deep (26 meter) trench in the Tenasserim Hills along its 1,640-foot-long (500 meter) track. POWs and forced laborers painstakingly hacked open the mass of solid rock using hand tools, making it wide enough for the train to slide through. Nearby, the TripAdvisor top-rated and air-conditioned Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum is run by the Office of Australian War Graves. It offers videos, photographs, drawings, tools and testimony. The highly recommended portable audio headset includes the voices of survivors who describe atrocities they endured, which you can listen to while wandering between Hellfire Pass's stone walls. From the museum, a walking trail of a few hundred yards leads to Hellfire Pass, also called the Konyu Cutting, and you can continue walking down the abandoned railway line for a couple of miles. That route reveals a gorgeous valley, other rock \"cutting\" railway passes and a couple of trestle bridges. The jungle is often hot and humid, with voracious mosquitoes. Visitors unprepared to deal with either usually find the going uncomfortable. Nearby WWII attractions . Back in town, the manicured Kanchanaburi \"Don Rak\" War Cemetery includes most of the POWs' remains recovered from nearby mass graves. POWs are also interred at nearby Chungkai, and in Myanmar at Thanbyuzayat. The excellent Thailand-Burma Railway Center, next to the cemetery, displays research by an Australian who was a Commonwealth War Graves Commission manager of the Kanchanaburi and Chungkai war cemeteries. The center includes extensive details about the railway, Hellfire Pass, POW camps and cemetery sites in Thailand, plus biographies and artifacts. Visitors can also tour Kanchanaburi's Thai-owned JEATH Museum and World War II Museum. Managed by a Thai Buddhist temple, the JEATH \"Wat Tai\" Museum's design is similar to the bamboo-and-thatch shacks where POWs were housed, and displays POW testimonies and paintings, plus news reports and other objects. Scary, painted wooden effigies show life-sized prisoners being tortured, dying and laboring on the railway, alongside statues of Hitler, Tojo, Stalin and other wartime leaders. The acronym JEATH indicates the countries of Japan, England, Australia, Thailand and Holland, which were intertwined in the Death Railway's creation. Nearby was the so-called \"Bridge on the River Kwai,\" a POW-built steel and concrete structure with 11 curved spans. Next to that was a wooden trestle railway bridge, still partially preserved. Both bridges were completed in 1943, and repeatedly bombed by British and U.S. warplanes. Today, tourists can take a short train ride across a fully functional, duplicate \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" closer to Kanchanaburi -- built to resemble the obliterated original. You can also walk across the bridge and take boats on the river below. Hellfire Pass in popular culture . The Death Railway's main structure was immortalized in the partially fictional 1957 movie classic, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai.\" In 2013, Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman starred in \"The Railway Man,\" portraying Death Railway survivor and former POW Eric Lomax. On October 14, Australian author Richard Flanagan, 53, won Britain's Booker Prize for his novel titled, \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North,\" describing his father's experience as a POW who survived after laboring on the Death Railway.

The 29-year-old, who joined City from English Premier League rivals Arsenal in 2009, learned of his failed drugs test from the English Football Association (FA) on Thursday. \"Manchester City confirm that the FA has informed Kolo Toure that an 'A-sample' provided by him has tested positive for a specified substance,\" a statement published on the club's official website read. It continued: \"As result of this, he has been suspended from participating in all first team and non-first team matches pending the outcome of the legal process. \"There will be no further comment from the football club at this stage.\" According to the World Anti-Doping Agency a specified substance is one which could have \"a credible, non-doping explanation.\" Punishments for a positive test range from a warning to a two-year ban from sport. Toure has made more than 50 appearances for City and was captain of the side last season. He is contracted at the club -- where his younger brother Yaya also plays -- until 2013. Elsewhere in the Premier League, leaders Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has been charged with improper conduct by the FA over comments he made about referee Martin Atkinson on Tuesday . Following United's 2-1 league defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge Ferguson told MUTV: \"I must say, when I saw who the referee was I feared it. I feared the worst. He added: \"You want a fair referee, or a strong referee anyway -- and we didn't get that.\" The Scot criticized Atkinson for not sending off Chelsea goalscorer David Luiz for fouls on Wayne Rooney and Javier Hernandez, as well as for awarding what proved to be a decisive penalty late in the match. Ferguson already has a suspended two-game touchline ban hanging over him from 2009 when he said that Alan Wiley was not physically fit enough to referee in the Premier League. A statement on the FA website stated that Ferguson has until next Tuesday to respond to the charge.",

Having hundreds of Facebook friends may seem like the ultimate sign of popularity and happiness, yet it could actually suggest the opposite. Researchers from Maine compared personality traits to levels of happiness among more than 16,000 people over a four-year period. People listed as extroverted at the start of the study gradually saw an increase in wellbeing, but as this wellbeing and happiness increased, the same participants became more introverted and withdrawn. Researchers compared personality traits to levels of well-being in 16,367 participants. People who were more outgoing at the start of the four-year study saw increased levels of happiness. Yet as this happiness increased, the outgoing participants became more introverted, and withdrawn . A 2012 study by Wake Forest University . found introverts experience greater happiness when they . act more extroverted. While follow-up studies found that introverts have an . exaggerated fear of embarrassment from acting like an extrovert. Researchers from Ohio recently found that a profile photo on Facebook tells friends, or potential friends, all they need to know to form an impression of someone and virtually no words are necessary. In one experiment, college students who viewed a Facebook photo of a fellow student having fun with friends rated that person as extroverted - even if his profile said he was 'not a big people-person.' The only exception is when a photo is out of the ordinary or shows someone in a negative light. In that case, people do use profile text to help interpret what kind of person is shown in the profile. This suggests having lots of friends can ultimately make people less sociable, and can increase sadness - the opposite of what the researchers expected. Lead author Professor Christopher Soto added this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships. Professor Soto, from Colby College, analysed personality traits and well-being among 16,367 participants who were surveyed repeatedly over four years. He was able to examine which aspects of personality at the start of the study predicted which patterns of well-being later on, and whether wellbeing at the start was linked to later personality changes. The results showed that people 'who were initially extraverted, agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable subsequently increased in well-being.' But they also revealed that people with high levels of well-being to begin with 'subsequently became more agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and introverted.' Increased introversion for happy people was the opposite of what had been expected because higher extraversion usually leads to greater future happiness. The findings suggests having lots of friends in real-life, and on social networks such as Facebook, can ultimately make people less sociable, and increase sadness. The study claims this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships . It suggests that the influence of personality on well-being was ‘somewhat stronger’ than well-being on personality, yet both were significant when forming relationships. Links observed in the study were also likely to grow stronger over longer periods, Professor Soto suggested. ‘Even small changes to an individual’s personality traits or subjective well-being can have important consequences for the course of his or her life,’ he said. ‘These findings challenge the common assumption that associations of personality traits with subjective well-being are entirely, or almost entirely, due to trait influences on well-being,’ Professor Soto concluded. The study was published in the Journal of Personality.",

        "document": "In a  discovery that has shocked everyone involved, experts have found DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space as well as re-entry into the atmosphere. Scientists who attached small double strands of DNA to the outer casing of a rocket said they were 'completely surprised' when more than half the samples remained intact. This was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000°C (1,800°F) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back, and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on Earth from space. Scientists at the University of Zurich have discovered that DNA can survive the harsh conditions of space and re-entry into the atmosphere. The  finding was made by attaching DNA to the outer casing of a rocket, shown launching from the Esrange base in Kiruna, Sweden. It has led to questions about the origin of life on Earth . The research, published online in the journal Plos One, was carried out by scientists from the University of Zurich in Switzerland. The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European base of Esrange in Kiruna, northern Sweden, and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket. But scientists decided, in addition, to test the effects space travel has on DNA when carried at three positions on the rocket's outer casing - and found it survived. Panspermia is the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is spread by asteroids and comets, in addition to simply drifting through the cosmos. Panspermia proposes life forms that can survive the effects of space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life. These life-forms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. If met with ideal conditions on a new planet's surface, the bacteria become active and the process of evolution begins, it is believed. Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the Earth early in its history. But some go further and suggest that DNA, the essential molecule of life itself, could reach the Earth in meteoric dust, 100 tonnes of which hit the planet each day - a theory known as panspermia. During the experiment, around 53 per cent of the DNA was recovered from the grooves in screw heads, and more than a third remained fully functional. The 'plasmid' DNA carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance. It was shown to function by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria, and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells. Dr Cora Thiel, one of the scientists from the University of Zurich, said: 'We were completely surprised to find so much intact and functionally active DNA.' Professor Oliver Ullrich, from the same university, added: 'This study provides experimental evidence that the DNA's genetic information is essentially capable of surviving the extreme conditions of space and the re-entry into Earth's dense atmosphere.' The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European  Esrange Space Center (shown on map) and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket - but the surprising DNA discovery is likely to spark considerable attention . The type of DNA carried by the rocket was known as 'plasmid DNA' (stock image shown). This carried genes for fluorescence and antibiotic resistance. It was shown to function on its return to Earth by conferring antibiotic resistance to bacteria, and driving a flourescent marker in nucleated cells . The research also suggested that scientists conducting space missions to other planets needed to be careful about contamination. Proffesor Ullrich said: 'The results show that it is by no means unlikely that, despite all the safety precautions, space ships could also carry terrestrial DNA to their landing site. 'We need to have this under control in the search for extraterrestrial life.' Back in August, traces of plankton and other microorganisms were found living on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS) by Russian cosmonauts. They claim the plankton were not carried there at launch - but are thought to have been blown there by air currents on Earth. Incredibly, the tiny organisms were found to be able to survive in the vacuum of space despite the freezing temperatures, lack of oxygen and cosmic radiation. Some said the plankton may simply have been contamination from other areas of the ISS. Nonetheless, the discovery appeared to prove extremely primitive life could survive in the harsh environment of space. And, coupled with this latest research, the finding raises interesting questions about the origin of life on Earth. Many scientists believe comets may have brought organic building blocks of life such as amino acids to the early Earth. But, some go further and suggest DNA, the essential molecule of life itself, could reach the Earth in meteoric dust from elsewhere in the universe (stock image shown) - a theory known as panspermia .

        "document": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Cell phones and TVs converging with the Internet? That's so 2008. The next big tech trend may be the marriage of computer technology to your car or truck. This spring, Ford will offer a dashboard computing system on its full-size pickups and E-series vans. This month, Hyundai is launching a system that warns motorists when they drift out of the lane they're traveling in. Another manufacturer has developed pedestrian-detection software that works with heat-seeking cameras to alert drivers when someone is in their path. In March, Ford will release a fully functional, dashboard computer -- complete with keyboard -- geared to contractors and other business folks who want to access the Web, review documents and log inventory while on the go. In the spring, AT&T will launch an in-car entertainment service with 22 satellite TV channels. Industry executives hope the new technological bells and whistles will put some sizzle back into stagnant vehicle sales. \"Consumers want a vehicle that's always on and always connected,\" said Kieran O'Sullivan, vice president at Continental Automotive Systems, which supplies parts and technology to automakers. In the near future, he said, \"consumers and carmakers will be able to customize the [dashboard] instrument panel to their individual tastes the same way that people customize their mobile phones.\" O'Sullivan spoke Thursday at a panel discussion at the International Consumer Electronics Show subtitled, \"The Automobile's Convergence with Consumer Electronics.\" Panelists, including executives from Microsoft, Nokia and GM's OnStar service, agreed the industry is just beginning to tap the potential of in-car computing. \"We'll someday use this information technology in ways we can't even predict today,\" said Tom Phillips, general manager of Microsoft's automotive unit. \"To me, we're in the infancy in terms of the amount of evolution that's going to occur.\" As consumers are growing accustomed to having mobile Internet through their smart phones, more car buyers are seeking connectivity in their vehicles that will allow them to move seamlessly between their digital lives at work and home, panelists said. Half of the new vehicles sold in the United States are now compatible with MP3 players and 80 percent can connect with wireless Bluetooth headsets, said automotive technology expert John Waraniak, who served as the panel's moderator. iReport.com: Are you attending CES? General Motors' OnStar service, which can remotely unlock car doors, reduce gas flow to a stolen vehicle or dial 911 if a car is involved in a crash, now has almost 6 million subscribers. Toyota said this week it plans to launch a similar driver-assist program on certain models beginning this summer. Not to be outdone, Ford's similar Sync system, which now comes standard on many vehicles, is adding voice-activated, on-demand traffic, sports and weather reports, plus GPS-assisted navigation. In a keynote speech Thursday at CES, Ford CEO Alan Mulally said the automaker is learning to think more like an electronics company. Ford will begin installing its Works Solutions package on its full-size pickups and E-series vans this spring. The dashboard computing system costs $1,195 plus a monthly Web access fee, has a 6-inch touch screen and runs on Windows. It will allow electricians and other contractors to create Excel spreadsheets, print invoices and even access other computers. \"Ford is truly making the office mobile,\" said Ford product development manager Bill Frykman while demonstrating the system Thursday to reporters in an F-150 parked in a large tent outside the Las Vegas Convention Center. \"This bridges the gap between the full laptop and a smart phone.\" Meanwhile, an entire hall at CES is devoted to the latest in automotive technology, from portable navigation units to rear-mounted cameras which, with the help of a dashboard screen, allow the driver to see what's immediately behind his vehicle while backing up. Here's a quick peek at some other automotive technology on display at CES this week: . -- FLIR Systems, Inc. makes a thermal-imaging camera, an option on BMW's 6-series sedans, with a new pedestrian-detection feature. When the camera detects a heat source in the shape of a human being, the on-board computer alerts the driver by highlighting the pedestrian in yellow on the dashboard screen. -- AT&T's CruiseCast service brings 22 satellite TV channels to your vehicle with the help of a small rooftop antenna, augmented by video-buffering technology that supposedly maintains the signal underneath overpasses and trees. It will cost $1,299 plus a $28 monthly fee and is being pitched to parents with kids and pre-game tailgaters. \"It's an extension of your living room,\" said Jackie Lapin, a spokeswoman for AT&T. -- Nervous about handing the car keys to your 16-year-old? The CarChip ($119) plugs into any post-1995 model vehicle and records 300 hours of how the car has been driven, including mileage, speed, braking and acceleration. Parents can remove the chip, download its data to a computer and use the information to verify driving agreements with their teens. Newer features even let parents set restrictions on their kids' driving. \"If you want to set it at a certain speed -- say, 'I don't want my kid going over 65 mph' -- it'll beep at them until they slow down,\" said Michael Copeland, sales manager for manufacturer Davis Instruments. -- Hyundai's latest vehicles can be outfitted with a system that detects when a car is drifting across lanes, then sounds a buzzer or vibrates the wheel to alert the driver. Some Hyundai vehicles also contain ultrasonic sensors that help drivers to park by measuring the distance between a car and other objects. In fact, the next generation of automotive technology may employ automatic steering and braking systems that relieve drivers of much of the responsibility for, well, driving. \"Maybe 15 years from now, cars will drive themselves. That's certainly a goal some companies have,\" said Jay James of FLIR Systems. \"It's not just 'Jetsons' stuff now. It's really starting to happen.\" Some 2,700 exhibitors and 130,000 attendees are in Las Vegas, Nevada, for CES, the nation's largest consumer electronics trade show. The event runs through Sunday.

        "document": "Two soldiers were ‘marched to death’ in a gruelling SAS selection exercise on the hottest day of the year. The Territorial Army pair were among six men to collapse with heat exhaustion in the Brecon Beacons mountain range. All six were flown to hospital where two were pronounced dead and a third was fighting for his life. Two soldiers died in the Brecon Beacons during a training exercise on what was the hottest day of the year, the Ministry of Defence has said (file picture) Around 100 Territorial Army troops . took part in Saturday’s exercise in rugged terrain 2,900ft above sea . level, close to Pen Y Fan, the highest peak in South Wales. Commanders put them through brutal physical trials, including . long runs in body armour while carrying weapons, ammunition and . battlefield equipment weighing more than 100lbs. But, as temperatures hit 30C, the casualties started to pile up. An RAF Sea King helicopter was . deployed immediately along with a civilian air ambulance to ferry the . victims to hospital at Merthyr Tydfil. Expertise: Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said the gruelling SAS tryout 'push soldiers to the extreme' Last night the tragedy was being investigated by the Ministry of Defence and Dyfed-Powys Police.  The families have been informed. An MOD spokeswoman said they will not cancel any exercises as a result of the deaths, but would not say whether any extra safety measures had been implemented in the wake of the tragedy. She said: 'Routine exercises will continue.' One Army officer said: ‘The troops . are desperate to prove they are up to joining the SAS and push . themselves harder and harder. They are encouraged to by the instructors . who are unforgiving. ‘There is going to be a huge inquiry . into what happened because on the face of it these lads look like . they’ve been marched to death. ‘More should be done to ensure these needless tragedies don’t occur.’ The men, who were seeking entry to an . SAS reserve unit, collapsed  in hills near the town of Brecon. A . defence source said: ‘It is a case of the people succumbing to the . training that they were doing. 'We have health and safety procedures in . place for everything but that must be balanced against the fact we are . training people to go into extremely challenging environments. ‘We don’t go out of our way to kill . people but we have to put them in tough situations because that is what . they will be facing on operations.’ The Brecon Beacons are a notoriously . inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both . regular units and the special forces. Sources indicated the tragedy was caused by heat exhaustion. A third soldier remains in hospital . The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales . Welsh beauty spot: Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war . Matthew Dorrance, Mayor of Brecon, said the town was reeling from the tragedy. He . said: 'There is a historic link between Brecon and the armed forces and . we're proud of that. In fact, various regiments have the freedom of the . county and Brecon and news like this shakes us to our core. 'More . or less everyone in Brecon knows someone who has served and the . community is shocked by what's happened, and deeply moved.' Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, writes: . Many times during my military service I have seen just how treacherous the Brecon Beacons can be, especially on the rare occasions of soaring heat. This is the ultimate testing ground for British troops preparing for battle and it is no coincidence that selection for the Special Air Service – the toughest training in the world – takes place in these rugged Welsh hills. Military combat demands extreme levels of physical fitness and endurance, and nowhere is this truer than in the blistering heat of Afghanistan’s deserts. British troops have fought with enormous success there and to a great extent this is due to arduous training in areas such as Brecon where fitness, navigation, combat survival and teamwork are tested in near battle conditions. Soldiers are pushed to the extreme, marching for hours by day and night, carrying weapons, ammunition, battle equipment and a rucksack weighing more than 50lb. Commanders and soldiers are all taught about the potentially lethal hazards of operating in the heat, which is equally dangerous in training and in actual combat. Although we don’t know exactly what went wrong in the Beacons on Saturday, the awful reality is that when troops train for war, tragedy can sometimes strike, however well prepared they might be. In January, Captain Rob Carnegie was . found dead on the mountain range’s snow-covered Corn Du peak. He was . taking part in a gruelling 40-mile march in freezing conditions as part . of a selection process for the SAS when he collapsed. Army chiefs say the rugged and . sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for . warfare, as well as putting their logistic, survival and map-reading . skills to the test. But the uplands can prove dangerous even to the most hardened service personnel. Major Alan Davies, who was involved . in contingency planning during the first Gulf War, said it is one of the . most challenging terrains military personnel can encounter. ‘On one end of the spectrum you have . cadets being taken for mountain walking and at the other end of the . spectrum the SAS use it,’ he said. Major Davies said the dead men, who . have not been named, would have been carrying heavy equipment and . pushing themselves hard to a deadline. Tory MP David Davies, a former member . of the Territorial Army, said: ‘Nobody should jump to any conclusions . here about what may have caused this, but obviously we all know that, . for example, people who take part in marathons run a small risk of dying . of heat stroke and all sorts of other things, and the British Army does . train its soldiers very, very hard indeed. The training is there for a purpose, and it is arduous training at any level, and sometimes things tragically go wrong.’ The Army’s website says of the Brecon . Beacons: ‘Training for high-intensity, light-role war fighting is the . way soldiers and officers are prepared for any operational situation . they may face – conventional war, counter insurgency, security sector . reform, peacekeeping or supporting civil authorities. ‘This ensures that the training is as . close to current operations and pre-deployment training as possible, . whilst maintaining the ability to train for high intensity war . fighting.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘The MoD can confirm that it is . working with Dyfed-Powys Police to investigate an incident during a . training exercise on the Brecon Beacons on Saturday in which two members . of military personnel died. ‘More information will be released in due course but it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.’ The three other men who were taken to hospital were discharged after being checked over by doctors. Saturday's tragedy was not the first time soldiers have died training in the Brecon Beacons. In January, Captain Rob Carnegie was taking part in a grueling 17-40 mile march in freezing conditions as part of a selection process for the special forces regiment when he collapsed and died. The soldier, in this 20s, was given first aid by army personnel but could not be revived and was declared dead at the scene. And in January 2011, Benjamin Poole, 26, collapsed at the end of an 18-mile mountain march carrying a 44lb rucksack and rifle. Fsl Wilkinson, pictured with his step-son, had only recently been stationed in Germany when he was shot . He had been sent on the grueling exercise with a group of soldiers as punishment for littering. On Friday, a Sergeant and a Corporal were given lengthy military jail sentences after a soldier died when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise, in Kenya . Corporal Colin Bell and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price have also been thrown out of the army following Fusilier James Wilkinson's death. Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops. Bell had taken the barrel of a machine gun that had become jammed and while inspecting the weapon it fired, hitting Fsl Wilkinson in the neck. The court heard that Bell, 29, and Price had failed to follow procedure by failing to call an armourer to fix the weapon. A judge ruled that the death of the serviceman from the 2nd . Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had been 'wholly and . utterly avoidable'.",

        "document": "The daredevil adventurer whose attempt to ‘run’ more than 1,000 miles from South Florida to Bermuda in an inflatable bubble had to be aborted after he got lost is extremely unhappy that his pod wasn’t rescued along with him. Endurance athlete Reza Baluchi, 42, was plucked from the ocean on Saturday morning but his Hydro Pod - a floating sphere, encased in a metal fame, that allowed him to run on water, like a hamster in a wheel - remains lost at sea. When Baluchi was rescued he was told a fisherman would haul his bubble back to shore, but  he’s since been informed that that wasn’t possible and so his bubble was left still floating at sea. Scroll down for video . Endurance athlete Reza Baluchi, 42, was plucked from the ocean on Saturday morning but his Hydro Pod remains lost at sea . That isn’t good news for Baluchi, who says his valuables were left inside the bubble - including his green card, passport, cellphone and even his shoes. To make matters worse, Baluchi had ploughed his entire life savings - some $4,500 - into designing and building the pod. Baluchi said he had been working two jobs, as a mechanic and restaurant dishwasher, in order to raise the funds for his adventure. ‘It took a long time,’ he told the Miami Herald. Time is now running out for him as the law of salvage in maritime law states that anyone who recovers another person's ship or cargo after peril or loss at sea is entitled to a reward equal to the value of the property. With no money or boat, the Iranian born U.S. citizen says he’ll needs help to get it back. 'I’m in trouble. Big trouble,' he said. The Coast Guard rescued Reza Baluchi from his Hydro Bubble 70 miles away from St. Augustine, Florida on Saturday morning . Baluchi was 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine when he was rescued on Saturday. Coast guard officers had originally spotted him inside his bubble on Wednesday, but he had waved coast away guard, saying he was determined to complete his intended 1,033-mile journey. Baluchi was on his own. No supporters or boats followed, a common net for athletes attempting open water voyages. When the coast guard first discovered him on Wednesday, he was disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda. His bubble was filled with protein bars and bottled water - though he had claimed before setting off that he would mostly survive by fishing. Worried by Baluchi's apparent state of exhaustion and lack of adequate supplies, the coast guard had asked him to end his mission, but he  refused. The coastguard continued to track him until Saturday morning when Baluchi activated his Personal Locating Beacon. After receiving his signal, an HC-130 airplane and a MH-60 helicopter were dispatched along with a rescue ship. Helicopter rescue: Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews and found to be uninjured . Once they arrived at his coordinates, a rescue swimmer had got Baluchi out of his inflatable and into a helicopter. He was evaluated by medics and judged to be 'fatigued' although not injured. The coastguard wanted him back to shore. 'He activated both his spot beacon, and personal locating beacon. That’s a distress call. When he activated those two things, he was calling for help,' said Petty Officer Mark Barney, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard. Baluchi disagrees. He said on Sunday that he didn’t turn on the beacon internationally, and had the energy to keep going. He said people thought he was disoriented because he was sleeping during the day and bubbling at night. Baluchi calculated that temperatures inside the bubble would top 120 degrees during the day, so for the four days he was at sea, he waited until nightfall to move forward. 'I never quit,' he said. 'It’s not me.' Baluchi says he ploughed his entire life savings - some $4,500 - into designing and building the pod . According to Baluchi's website, Bermuda was just one stop in Baluchi’s ambitious - if not impossible - mission to outline the Bermuda Triangle: a thousand miles to Bermuda, another thousand south to Puerto Rico and another thousand east, back to South Florida. 'Everyone wants to know how Reza Baluchi will be successful in his travel to through the Bermuda triangle. Reza is so confident that he will succeed in this trip because he has carefully articulated every detail it takes to survive,' he had written on his website. Baluchi had first tried to set off on his adventure last weekend, but his bubble was literally burst when some large children got into it when he wasn’t looking. The bubble’s weight limit is about 200 pounds . ‘There were kids on the beach. And they were jumping inside it,’ Baluchi said. 'I patched up the hole, and it was ready.' In the end, Baluchi set sail three days later, but he now says his mission is in limbo. 'I go around running, telling people, if you have a dream, you can do anything,' Baluchi said. 'Now I’m here, no money no bubble, no anything.' Baluchi left his valuables inside the bubble including his green card, passport, cellphone and even his shoes . Long Journey: Reza Baluchi was attempting to travel 1,033 miles from Florida to Bermuda . Baluchi claims he designed his Hydro Pod specifically to take him on his journey across the ocean. He said: 'Being inside the Hydro Pod is not going to be a walk in the park; it will be very hot and humid. One can easily dehydrate quickly and lose breath. 'Reza has devised this Hydro Pod to prevent physical difficulties. But not anyone can use without being mentally and physically fit. Being mentally fit is the main component to be able to survive a long journey in the Hydro Pod.' In 2013, Reza tested his Hydro Pod by taking it out from Newport Beach to Catalina Island. Next he wanted to cross the Bermuda Triangle because of the stories of shipwrecks and plane crashed linked to the area. The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the Atlantic in which an imaginary line is drawn from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico. 1.The distance between Miami, Fl to Bermuda is approximately 1,033 miles one way. 2. The Hydro Pod is made of 3mm thick plastic. 3. Inside the Hydro Pod it will reach up 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 4. Reza is an excellent fisherman and will be catching his food on a daily basis. On those days that he is not be able to catch fish, he will he survive on his homemade protein bars. 5  He will need to manually pump his Hydro Pod for one hour to ensure that it will stay afloat. 6. At night the Hydro Pod will have a light emitting from the bottom to help with the travel. 7. Reza will rest in the early hours of the morning when the sea is calmest . 8. On a daily basis 400,000 ships sail through the Bermuda without harm or loss . 9.The frame is designed by Mr. Reza Baluchi. 10. A typical day will be, Reza will be sleeping from 6am-9am, will wake up to start running until his body becomes too hot, he will then jump into the sea to cool himself off with a leash strapped to his leg connected to the bubble. 11.He will sleep on a hammock that will be inside the bubble. 12. He will have tracking device on him so that his team is aware of his position at all times. 13. Reza is doing this dangerous journey to raise money for children in need and to give inspire     those that have lost hope for a better future. Also to raise awareness for his Non-Profit Organization called Plant Unity. Plant Unity is a charity devoted to kids that are in need of basic living necessities. For example, clothes, medical and financial help and also to teach them healthy living skills. Plant Unity slogan is 'Children are like roots of a tree – I like to nourish the roots and help them grow.' Text quoted from source: http://runwithreza.org/bermuda.php .",

        "document": "The father accused of throwing his five-year-old daughter to her death over a 60-foot bridge has made his second court appearance after a mental health assessment but refused to speak to the judge. John Jonchuk, 25, is charged with first degree murder after a police officer claims to have seen him parking on Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St Petersburg, Florida, before throwing Phoebe Jonchuk into the river. The cop said he heard the girl scream. Today, Jonchuk was brought before a judge and assigned an attorney, but was immediately escorted out after court marshals said he was refusing to speak. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: John Jonchuk appeared in court for the second time over his daughter's death but didn't talk . In custody: John Jonchuk Jr, 25, (left) has been charged with murder after his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) was thrown to her death off a 60ft bridge in Tampa Bay . At his first appearance Jonchuk was asked if he had an attorney and he said he was 'leaving it up to God'. Candlelit vigils for Phoebe have stood in St Petersburg since her death last Wednesday. Child protection services have scrambled to overhaul their policies after it emerged they were alerted to John Jonchuk's delusional behavior hours before his alleged attack. It was one of two red flags waved at government agencies on Wednesday that went ignored. An anonymous caller told Florida's Department of Children and Families on Wednesday afternoon they had seen the 25-year-old driving around in his pajamas looking 'delusional and depressed'. But the call 'did not rise to the level of reasonable cause to suspect' according to the DCF's policies and the report was not investigated. Earlier that day, Jonchuk's attorney had called police warning that he was 'acting strangely' during a custody meeting, calling her 'God' and asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. Devastated: Jonchuck's mother and the girl's grandmother Michelle Lynn Jonchuck, has said she never wants to see her son again and claims she wishes it was him who had died on the bridge . Angelic: Tributes have been paid to Phoebe and a memorial set up for her near the bridge where she fell . Officers went to interview Jonchuk outside daughter Phoebe's day care but they found nothing suspicious. Hours later, Jonchuk was allegedly seen driving at 100mph to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge and throwing five-year-old Phoebe to her death. She was pulled from the water 40 minutes later but paramedics could not resuscitate the child. The DCF has announced that all warning calls will now be investigated within four hours, and a notice will be issued to law enforcement, Click Orlando reported. DCF Secretary Mike Carroll said: 'The horrible nature of this little girl’s murder at the hands of her father is heart wrenching and demands our most immediate and thorough response.' His statement added: 'We have to do more for the children, like Phoebe, who depend on us to protect them.' On Friday, relatives and friends remained gathered around a memorial site for Phoebe. Jonchuk's mother, Phoebe's grandmother, Michelle Lynn Jonchuk has said her son should have killed himself instead. Speaking to Click Orlando, she also paid tribute to the youngster, saying: 'She always had a smile on her face, she loved to dance and she sung. First hearing: Jonchuk said he wanted to leave himself 'in the hands of God' when asked about representation . Troubled relationship: Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, said Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. She added that he had been diagnosed with bipolar . 'My angel': Paying tribute to Phoebe, Miss Kerr said: 'She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated.' 'I don't forgive him. There is no sense in this. He didn't have to do this to her. I just wish there was one thing God could do was to bring her back.' She added that she was supposed to pick Phoebe up from school on Thursday. The last time she saw her son and daughter together, she said everything was normal. Michelle Kerr, Phoebe's mother who last saw her on Christmas Eve, told the station that Jonchuck gave her restricted access to her daughter. 'She was my angel, I always called her my angel baby. She loved to learn new things. She loved to make you smile. She was so animated,' she said. 'He would only let me talk to her on the phone. He wouldn't disclose his location, so I didn't know where to go.' 'He was very, very bipolar,' she told Tampa Bay News. 'He was Jekyll and Hyde all the way.' Among other medication, Miss Kerr says Mr Jonchuk took regular doses of bipolar pills Seroquel and anti-depressives Zoloft. When they met, she added, Mr Jonchuk was her 'gay friend', until he told her he 'liked women too'. Soon after, Phoebe was born. Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records. On the last night she saw Phoebe, Miss Kerr said she and Jonchuck had a nice evening together, but later on he called child protective services and made a false abuse allegations. She added that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and had been admitted to a mental hospital on several occasions. 'He does the Jekyll and Hyde. It's just something that goes on in his head, he just wasn't wired right. 'He's not mentally stable, but he was mentally stable enough to take care of a child for five years, so he knew what he did. He cried, the detective said.' It has since emerged Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish. With no fixed abode, the father and daughter have been living with John Jonchuk Sr for two months. But at midnight last night Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report. The officer who spotted the Cruiser gave chase and saw the driver reach the top of Dick Misener Bridge then enter the approach to the Skyway. The car was then seen to stop and a figure emerged, throwing a child over the side of the rail into the water off Boca Ciega Bay. The officer said he heard the girl scream as she fell. Issues: Mr Jonchuk separated from Miss Kerr, who has MS, following six tumultuous years together - during which police were called numerous times for domestic violence issues. Both had arrest records . Scene: Jonchuk was allegedly seen speeding at 100mph in a PT Cruiser toward the Sunshine Skyway bridge, according to a police report . Jonchuk returned to the car and drove south but was stopped by Manatee County authorities about 30 minutes later. He was arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. Jonchuk also faces charges of aggravated assault with a motor vehicle on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding police. The girl was found 40 minutes later by divers from Eckerd College and attempts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and her mother was informed. At Jonchuk's first hearing on Thursday, Pinellas County Judge Michael Andrews asked him if he wanted an attorney. 'I want to leave it in the hands of God,' Jonchuck said. Arrested: An officer who claims to have witnessed the incident chased Jonchuk and detained him . Behavior: Mr Jonchuk was interviewed by police earlier that day after 'acting strangely' in a meeting with his attorney to discuss Phoebe's custody - calling the lawyer 'God' then asking her to read the Bible in Swedish . Tragic: This is the car seat, recovered from Boca Ciega Bay, in which investigators found the dead child . The judge responded: 'I'm pretty sure God's not going to be representing you in this case. You're going to be standing trial.' Details have since emerged of Jonchuk's 'strange' behavior on Wednesday that prompted his attorney Genevieve Torres to contact police. Torres said she met with John Jonchuck on Wednesday to discuss the custody case for his five-year-old daughter, Phoebe. After their meeting, she was so worried about the father and daughter that she reported the odd statements to police. Officers interviewed Jonchuck and his daughter as he was picking her up from a church day care and both appeared to be in good health. Jonchuck said he didn't want to harm himself or anyone else, the documents said. 'She was smiling and appeared healthy, properly clothed and happy,' according to the documents. A little more than twelve hours later, police said Jonchuck threw his daughter over a bridge.",

        "document": "Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Surviving victims and family members of the Fort Hood massacre testified in emotional terms Monday over their personal trauma and grief, as the sentencing phase for the convicted murderer's court-martial moved quickly toward a dramatic conclusion. A military jury could begin considering by late Tuesday whether Maj. Nidal Hasan will get capital punishment for the horrific November 2009 shootings on this sprawling Army base. The Army Medical Corps officer was convicted Friday on all 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the shooting rampage at a Fort Hood deployment processing center. The incident occurred about a month before Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan. \"I was expected to either die or remain in a vegetative state,\" said Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, who was shot four times, including in the head. He recovered, but his left side remains partially paralyzed, and he said Monday that he struggles to cope with the injuries. \"It's affected every facet of my personality,\" he testified. \"I am a lot angrier, a lot darker than I used to be.\" Twenty percent of Zeigler's brain was removed in the initial surgery, and he has had more than 10 additional procedures. He leaves the service in October on medical retirement but said he will never be fully functional. Prison or death for Hasan? It's up to the jury now . Prosecutors began presenting the first of 19 witnesses, including a liaison or family member for each victim killed in the attack. They began describing the impact the shootings had on their lives, part of the \"aggravating\" evidence the prosecution will use to try to demonstrate why Hasan deserves lethal injection. A dozen victims and family members took the stand before the court-martial unexpectedly recessed for the day at midafternoon. Base officials would cite only \"logistical issues\" for the delay and said the judge was meeting in chambers with Hasan, who serves as his own attorney. The defendant -- who was wounded by military police in the attacks and paralyzed -- repeatedly asked the bench Monday to take brief breaks from the public proceedings, but the court offered no explanations. Proceedings resume Tuesday morning. During the nearly three-week trial phase, military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence. Unclear is whether Hasan himself will now present testimony or speak on his own behalf. He serves as his own attorney and has refused to put on a defense in court. The American-born psychiatrist of Palestinian descent has the opportunity to offer \"mitigating\" evidence that could persuade the panel to spare his life. He refused to cross-examine any of the victims and their families testifying. Angela Rivera lost her husband, Maj. Libardo Caraveo, a 52-year-old clinical psychologist preparing to deploy to Afghanistan when he was gunned down. When officials rang her doorbell to inform her of the news, 14 hours after the shooting, \"All I could say was, I knew it, I just knew he was dead, because he did not call me back\" after the incident. Rivera and Caraveo had three children living in the house at the time, including a 2-year-old. Rivera testified that her 12-year-old daughter was distraught, quoting her as saying, \" 'Mom, I hope who did this understands the pain he has caused all these families.' \" An older daughter could not cope, became suicidal and remains emotionally troubled, Rivera said. The father of Pvt. Francheska Velez said Hasan's action's left him devastated. His 21-year-old daughter was pregnant at the time of the premeditated murders. \"This man did not just kill 13 people,\" Juan Velez testified in Spanish. \"He killed my (unborn) grandson, and he killed me slowly.\" Pfc. Kham Xiong, 23, left behind a widow and three small children. \"We can only imagine\" what might have been, Shoua Her said quietly. \"These past few years haven't been easy being a single mother. ... I miss him a lot, his soft gentle hands, how he held me and made me feel safe and secure. \"I feel dead, yet I'm alive,\" she added, wiping away tears. On his own initiative, Hasan admitted early in the court-martial, \"The evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\" He has also indicated a willingness to die as a \"martyr.\" Judge Col. Tara Osborn is likely to instruct the military panel to ignore any direct pleas from Hasan that he be given lethal injection but to decide punishment only on the facts and testimony presented, in accordance with the law. The stakes in the penalty phase create an unusual dynamic in what was already a very unusual case. \"The U.S. military is not used to this kind of defendant, who apparently wants to die for his crimes. It might take a terrible weight off the jury -- if the inmate wants death, they may say, 'we'll accommodate.' It lessens the burden,\" said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center. \"On the other hand, the military by its nature, and in this time of war, sees a lot of death. They may not desire to add to it and give (Hasan) what he may want. His wishes might have a reverse effect.\" But Hasan's confessed rampage against innocents on a domestic military base will be an important consideration for the panel considering his fate. History may not be on Hasan's or the government's side. The last military execution was in 1961, and only five servicemen sit on death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The military has its own legal standards and procedures when trying and appealing capital cases. The U.S. Supreme Court gets the final say, if any petition reaches that far. Of the 11 military death sentences that have completed direct appeal, nine (82%) have been reversed.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:44 EST, 19 August 2013 . The man who was attacked by a polar bear last month in a Canadian national park, is back home in Maine and set to undergo jaw surgery today. Matthew Dyer flew into Lewsiton last Tuesday after spending three weeks recovering at a Montreal hospital from a polar bear attack at his camp in Torngat National Park on July 24. Thanks to the quick actions of his camping group, he miraculously survived and is back at his home in Turner, Maine. Miracle: The lawyer mauled by a polar bear last month in Canada returned to the U.S. last week and was pictured at his home in Turner, Maine Saturday . Back home: Matthew Dyer, pictured with his wife Jeanne Wells, is set to have jaw surgery today after being attacked by a polar bear July 24 . Dyer, a lawyer for Pine Tree Legal Services, was attacked during a Sierra Club guided tour of the Torngat Mountains National Park in the far Northern Labrador Mountains. Dyer's primary fear before going on the trip was that he wouldn't be physically fit enough. He trained all winter to make sure he would be able to cover the terrain. Polar bears are rampant in the park during the summer months when the melted ice confines them to land. But Dyer was unconcerned about the polar bears. Plus his group had an electrified fence used to surround the camp at night and keep the bears out. He even saw a few on the trip before the attack. One morning they witnessed a mother out with her baby cub. 'My god, they are cute, like a little stuffed animal,' Dyer told the Bangor Daily News. 'Then we had another big boy that came in and sat and watched us for a bit. We had to fire a flare at him to chase him off.' Deathly beautiful: Dyer was mauled while on a guided tour of the Torngat Mountains National Park led by the Sierra Club . But somehow the fence failed because a bear slipped through on July 24 while the rest of the camp was sleeping. Dyer was awake and saw the bear through his one-person tent. He yelled 'Bear in the camp! Bear in the camp!' before the beast latched onto his neck and wouldn't let go. Contrary to early reports by his wife that he fought back, Dyer says he did no such thing. His body went limp and he gave in. 'I thought I was dead,' he said. 'I could hear the bones crunching back in my head where he was chewing on me. I could see the bear’s legs. I was kind of under this belly with big white legs — no doubt what it was. I remember thinking to myself, it’s gotta happen to everyone. This is my time.' And then he saw the light. His group shot off flares at the bear as he was dragging Dyer down to the beach and the beast lost it's grip. Dyer believes it must have been a younger bear since an older one probably wouldn't have dropped him. Before: Dyer, a lawyer at Pine Tree Legal Services, pictured before the attack . His group carried Dyer back to the camp and performed what first-aid they could while they waited for emergency responders to arrive. It was a long wait. They were unable to communicate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's telecommunications center until 6:30 a.m. the next morning. Seven hours after the attack a helicopter arrived take Dyer and a doctor form the group to a base in Northern Quebec that had a trauma clinic. They were later transferred by fixed-wing aircraft to Montreal General Hospital for further treatment. The rest of the group was left with an Inuit - the only people allowed to carry guns in the park. While Dyer suffered severe injuries to his back and head, it could have been a lot worse since the bear's bite didn't cause any spinal chord damage. 'If he had bitten any other way, I think I would have been dead,' Dyer said. 'Either I would have had a stroke or been paralyzed. But now, here I am, sitting in Turner. It’s pretty nice.' Lucky: The polar bear's grip surprisingly didn't damage Dyer's spinal chord, which could have had debilitating effects . Dyer's wife Jeanne Wells is glad her husband is home safe and sound. Wells was informed of the attack the afternoon after it happened and flew into Montreal to be by her husband as he recovered. ‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she said. Land locked: Polar bears became more populated in the park during the summer when they are confined to land due to the melting of ice . A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005. 'There are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear. That said, this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established,' said Peter Deering, manager of resource conservation for Parks Canada in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park located on the Northern Labrador Mountains in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers. Dyer is expected to make a full recovery.",

        "document": "He was simply \"The Man.\" Stanley Frank Musial made a name for himself as one of baseball's best hitters of all time on the field, as well as one of its greatest, most dignified ambassadors off it. And now \"Stan the Man\" is gone. Musial died at his Ladue, Missouri, home  surrounded by family, the Cardinals said in a statement. According to a post on his Twitter page, which is maintained by his grandson Brian Musial Schwarze, Musial died at 5:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m. ET) Saturday of natural causes. He was 92. \"We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family,\" said William DeWitt Jr., the club's chairman. \"Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball.\" The Pennsylvania-born Musial transitioned from a lackluster pitcher to a stellar slugging outfielder, according to his biography on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's website. The left-hander had a batting average above .300 17 times during his 22-year career -- all played with St. Louis -- and earned three National League Most Valuable Player awards as well as three World Series titles. The only blip came in 1945, in the thick of World War II, when he left baseball to join the U.S. Navy. After the 1963 season, Musial retired with a .331 career batting average and as the National League's career leader in RBI, games played, runs scored, hits and doubles. He has since been surpassed in some of those categories, but he still ranks fourth in baseball history in total hits, behind only Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron. Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver dead . He also stood out for his grace and sportsmanship -- having never been ejected once by an umpire. In his retirement ceremony, then-Major League Commissioner Ford Frick referred to Musial as \"baseball's perfect warrior, baseball's perfect knight.\" In 1969, Musial was elected on his first try into the Hall of Fame, calling it \"the greatest honor of the many that have been bestowed upon me.\" During and after his playing career, Musial developed a special relationship with the St. Louis fan base, who knew him simply as \"Stan the Man.\" A bronze statue of him stands outside Busch Stadium, which is located in Musial Plaza along Stan Musial Drive. He continued with the organization for more than 25 years after his playing days ended, serving as vice president and general manager. And Musial was active in the community, contributing to causes such as the USO, the Senior Olympics, the Boy Scouts and Covenant House. \"I have no hesitation to say that St. Louis is a great place in which to live and work,\" he said in his Hall of Fame induction speech. \"We love St. Louis.\" His fans returned the favor, revering him for his play as well as his character and commitment to the area. \"Cardinal Nation will never be the same. Rest in peace Stan 'The Man' Musial, the best Cardinal there ever was,\" wrote one woman, by the name of Elise, on Twitter. Musial also stood tall outside eastern Missouri. He served between 1964 and 1967 as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. In 2011, President Barack Obama bestowed upon him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. \"Stan matched his hustle with humility,\" Obama said then. \"Stan remains, to this day, an icon, untarnished; a beloved pillar of the community; a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate.\" Lillian, Musial's wife of 71 years, died last May -- a longlasting marriage that some people, online, called as admirable as anything that happened on the diamond. Stan Musial's passing spurred an outpouring of condolences and praise. Commissioner Bud Selig described him as \"a Hall of Famer in every sense\" and \"a true gentleman,\" former pitcher Curt Schilling called his life \"a clinic in respect, integrity and honor,\" and current Cardinal Matt Holliday said it was \"an honor to the same uniform.\" The messages from fans were no less heartfelt. Wrote Jason Lukehart, on Twitter: \"In a week that's shown the dangers deifying athletes, Stan Musial's death reminds me that once in a great while, there's a man worthy of it.\" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .",

        "document": "Peter Lloyd says that the fact his gym has 'woman only' hours is sexist against men . When I became a member of my local gym, it was to exercise my body - not my human rights. But that's exactly what I'm doing with the Kentish Town Sports Centre in north London. The venue, owned by fitness company Better in association with Camden Council, attracts hundreds of people from all sections of society: religious, atheist, male, female, young and old. There is no dominant demographic. Everybody is welcome and everybody gets on. But not everybody is equal. Because, in an age of political over-correctness, they ban all men and boys for 442 hours every year - simply because they are male. Adding insult to injury, they still charge them the same full-price membership fee as women, but refuse to offer the equivalent option of male-only sessions. Not only is this an outrageous business model, but it's also sexist. Especially given that council officials base it almost solely on women's needs. Fair? I think not. But, because we live in an age of acceptable misandry, most people are too polite to say anything. Not me. Several weeks ago, I formally complained to the general manager, asking him to change the policy with one of three alternatives: A) maintain a women’s hour but introduce a men's alternative for fairness, B) keep women’s hour (and only women’s hour) but annually charge men less, or C) scrap single-gender sessions altogether. Hardly controversial. After all, if demand for women-only sessions is so great then the gym should put their money where their mouth is and fund it themselves. Unsurprisingly, they declined. 'A report by the Women Sport and Fitness Foundation showed that a significant proportion of women (26 per cent) “hate the way they look when they exercise”.' they replied in an email. 'This takes on an even greater significance when you consider that women feel even more self-conscious when taking part in sport and physical activity when men are present. If you are wondering who or what [we are] it's a charity that specialises in increasing women’s physical activity levels.' Translated into plain English, this means that a group of agenda-driven feminists say a minority of women 'feel' bad about their bodies. And because heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women, their very existence makes it worse, so they should be banned. No, seriously. That's like trying to clean a dirty face by rubbing a mirror. A report by the Women Sport and Fitness Foundation showed that a significant proportion of women 'hate the way they look when they exercise' It also assumes that all men in the gym are straight, when many of them are gay and have no interest in the female aesthetic. In fact, if they really wanted to, these men could be voyeuristic in the showers. So what next - gay and straight hours? And what about lesbians - can they attend women-only sessions, or would it make their straight sisters uncomfortable? Gimme a break. If these women have issues with their bodies, I truly sympathise - but it's their problem, not mine. Nor is it any other man's. And who's to say we don't have our own body hang-ups? We know for a fact that increasing numbers of men suffer from anorexia and bulimia as well as 'bigorexia' - the need to be as muscular as possible. Rates of men having cosmetic surgery are also increasing year-on-year, so the facts speak for themselves. Interestingly, women's hour also has little to do with religion. The gym have scarcely used faith to justify their policy, but - even if they did - it still wouldn't excuse their unequal price structure. Want women-only sessions for religious reasons? Fine - more power to you. But don't ask men to pay for 442 hours they can't possibly use. No God would approve of that. 'A group of agenda-driven feminists say a . minority of women 'feel' bad about their bodies. And because . heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women, their very existence . makes it worse, so they say we should be banned.' Furthermore, when I explained that men typically die before women, thus have a greater need to access fitness services – something based on cold, hard fact rather than feelings – they had no convincing answer. Tellingly, the gym's policy also assumes that only men can objectify the opposite sex. But if TV shows like Sex and the City taught us anything, it's that women can be just as forthright. In fact, only two weeks later, I was forced to complain when four teenage girls were wolf-whistling at boys in the weights area – jeering and laughing, while ranking them by size. This wouldn't be acceptable if the sexes were reversed, so why is it tolerated here? This is precisely why I’m suing them for gender bias. Not simply because their policy is unfair, but because it pathologises masculinity while simultaneously repressing it. As far as I'm concerned it also breaks the law. So far, the legal team at Camden Borough Council have simply made me laugh. They've spent hours quoting Harriet Harman's Equality Act, but continue to miss the point. No customer, male or female, should pay for gym time they're not allowed to use. It's that simple. Ultimately, however, it has nothing to do with money. At best, I want a 10 per cent refund; something I would donate to men's charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), but, like the test case of mis-sold PPI, it would empower other men to demand the same compensation - hitting the gym where it hurts. 'If these women have issues with their bodies, I truly sympathise - but it's their problem, not mine. Nor is it any other man's' But, finances aside, the Kentish Town Sports Centre has a social responsibility to encourage equality as well as physical health. Forcing men - whether 70 year-old pensioners or 13 year-old boys who attend with their mothers - to leave a room because of their gender, rather than their behaviour, is degrading. It's also eerily reminiscent of when African Americans were separated from their caucasian peers in 1940s America. Not least because the underlying maxim is the same. In this instance, that all men are inherently bad. This is a toxic message to send out, especially when those affected are frequently young boys in crucial stages of puberty and self-development. Such messages are pernicious. They criminalise men for being male, while telling women that they have less responsibility to contribute to functional gender relations. Interestingly, it's not just patrons who are angered. Last week I spoke with two of the gym's male fitness instructors who expressed their frustration with the ban - not least because, in the middle of a double-dip recession, neither can work during female-only sessions. It's insane. 'I’m suing the gym for gender bias. Not . simply because their policy is unfair, but because it pathologises . masculinity while simultaneously repressing it.' Fortunately, I have other helpful supporters who want to liberate them. Erin Pizzey, the woman who established the world's first-ever domestic violence shelter in 1972 before becoming a men's rights activist, has offered her backing. 'This discrimination has no place in modern society', she said. Meanwhile, equality charity Parity and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell have described my fight as 'sensible and fair'. Stateside, U.S. website AVoiceForMen.com have recently added their weight to my case. Now, I ask common sense and British law to do the same. Being a test case, my claim has sparked global interest because of its potential impact. If I win, gyms all over the country could be forced to update their policies. And rightly so. Not only would this be physically healthy for people who want to exercise without restriction, but it would also be socially healthy for those who understand the toxicity of sexism, whether directed at men or women. For some, this might be a revelation in itself, but trust me: it comes from a place of genuine fairness. Yes, my case may raise some eyebrows, but hopefully it will also raise some consciousness. Because, currently, the staff at my gym are telling our young men they're dangerous by default. And that's a weight no man should learn to carry.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Jena Johnson's profession is not one that people go to college for. It's also not work that gets easier with time. Her job is to help you die a \"good death.\" Her definition of \"good\" goes like this: a death in which a person's wishes for the end of his or her life are respected and carriecd out. No matter what those wishes are. She found herself in this role because of what she perceives as a great need in America to make discussions about death more a part of life. Because no one likes to talk about this stuff. More than a quarter of Americans said they have given no thought or not very much thought to their wishes for dying, a 2013 Pew Research Center survey found. Only a third said they have put their wishes in writing, something that Johnson knows to be vital in the middle of the most excruciating circumstances. From 9 to 5, in the Portland, Oregon, offices of the end-of-life advocacy group Compassion & Choices, Johnson and her staff field up to 100 calls a day. The number of those calls has swollen after the death last week of Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life with a fatal dose of barbiturates at age 29. Maynard was very public about why she chose to end her life. \"Because the rest of my body is young and healthy, I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind,\" she wrote in a CNN Opinion piece. \"I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months. And my family would have had to watch that. \"I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family, so I started researching death with dignity.\" Compassion & Choices partnered with Maynard and issued a statement saying that she \"died as she intended -- peacefully in her bedroom, in the arms of her loved ones.\" Others choose not to die like that. And that's OK with Johnson. She's had people tell her that they have the best benefits in the world, and they want to keep trying everything medically possible until the very end. Johnson, 58, previously was a mental health counselor and educator and has been an end-of-life consultant for the last seven years. Her goal is to make people aware of their options. She became more keenly aware of how tough things can get when her mother was dying of lung cancer in 1990. \"We took our cue from her,\" Johnson says. \"She had very pronounced ideas of how she wanted to go.\" Much of it was generational. Johnson's mother was from an era when people rarely listened to anything but doctor's orders. She entered a hospice and in the end, she suffered a great deal. Johnson says that had she known then what she knows now, she might have brought up other options for her mother. \"Most people say, 'I'm not afraid to die. I am afraid to suffer,' \" she says. \"Or they say, 'I've had a good life but I don't want my illness to compromise my loved one's memories.' It's very well thought out for these people.\" Johnson has a list of questions she asks her clients, which she prefers to call them rather than patients. Do you have an advance directive? That's a legal document that outlines a person's wishes at the end of life. One of her clients told her that she wanted very much to discuss her choices with her children but they refused to talk about their mom's death. So her client invited the whole family for Thanksgiving and when they sat down to dinner, each one found her advanced directive sitting on their plates. \"No one eats,\" said the client, \"until you've read this.\" Johnson first assesses a client's situation -- mobility, support system, treatment -- and then continues with tough questions. Do you want to have a feeding tube? Do you want to be kept on a ventilator? Do you want chemotherapy? Do you want to be put into a medical coma if no amount of medication can relieve your pain? Do you realize that one outcome of a medical coma could be your death? Are your family members supportive of your wishes? Sometimes a client will say that one of her children opposes her wish to die on religious or moral grounds. Johnson lets those clients know that they can specify which relatives will have the right to carry out end-of-life decisions. One of her colleagues currently is counseling a client with Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, which affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The client's only way of communication is using one finger to text. His spouse conducts conference calls with their children and with the end-of-life counselor who acts as a subjective third party. Recently, the counselor discovered that the family had put her client on a feeding tube, even though an advanced directive underscored: \"No feeding tube.\" \"My colleague asked the very question the family did not want to ask the patient: 'Do you really want this feeding tube? According to everything you have declared up to this point, you don't want this. Have you changed your mind?' \" The client said, \"No.\" \"It was a difficult conversation but a necessary one,\" Johnson says. \"They all knew what the answer was but it was so hard in their hearts.\" Another time, a client called Johnson to say her doctor had recommended radiation. \"Tell me again how old you are,\" Johnson said. \"97,\" the client replied. \"Wait. You are 97 and the doctor told you to go through this?\" That's when she advised her client of other options, though she never tells anyone what they ought to do. \"My job is to educate, to empower,\" Johnson says. \"I am glad the conversation has been elevated in the public consciousness.\" Brittany Maynard moved with her husband to Portland because Oregon is one of five states that recognize aid in dying as lawful medical practice. Among the 40 other states that are addressing \"assisted suicide,\" 38 criminalize it. Johnson takes issue with the term \"assisted suicide.\" Many people who commit suicide are physically healthy, she says, while her clients are terminally ill people taking control of their death. Polls show that most Americans support Maynard's decision and favor a full consideration of end-of-life options. About six in 10 Americans believe people suffering a great deal of pain with no hope of getting better have a moral right to end their lives, according to Pew. That's up from 55% in 1990. And most adults in America said there are at least some situations in which they, personally, would want to halt medical treatment and be allowed to die, according to Pew. But about a third responded that they would tell their doctors to do everything possible to keep them alive. Pew found that personal preferences are linked to religious affiliations. Many people believe that no one but God has the right to make a life or death decision. The Catholic Church, for instance, has guidelines on end-of-life decisions and forbids actions that are considered immoral by the church, including euthanasia and doctor-assisted death. Others believe feeling pain can be spiritually cleansing and redemptive, Johnson says. \"I don't get this, but some people think suffering is character building and they really want to suffer,\" she says. And that, too, can be a good death. Follow CNN's Moni Basu on Twitter . HOW WOULD YOU WISH TO DIE?

        "document": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're a comedy fan, you've probably heard of him by now. Comedian Brian Regan, 50, is famous for his clean jokes about everyday life. He is on tour. Famous for his clean jokes about everyday life, comedian Brian Regan is at the peak of his career, gaining new followers with every performance. On a recent Saturday night, he dazzled a sold-out audience of more than 2,000 people near Atlanta as part of his 2009 comedy tour. The easygoing 50-year-old comedian with a boyish smile and energetic presence pranced back and forth across the stage Saturday telling jokes that brought laughter to issues both serious and silly -- from the stressful economy to the quirks of text messaging. Regan, a Miami, Florida, native, has been performing stand-up comedy since 1980 by starting at small venues and comedy clubs. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s after the release of his album \"Brian Regan Live,\" which sold 150,000 copies despite the comedian's relative obscurity at the time. The album featured simple routines that made fun of childhood memories such as Little League baseball games and seat belts. His witty, clean style of humor on the album, which resonated with a wide audience from college kids to grandmothers, catapulted him to success. Since then, he has gone on to release three DVDs. Punchline Magazine, a comedy publication, named Regan's most recent DVD, \"The Epitome of Hyperbole,\" one of the top five comedy DVDs of 2008. Nowadays, he routinely appears on television, including specials on Comedy Central and slots on the \"Late Show With David Letterman.\" His tour this year will visit more than 80 cities, nearly twice as many as four years ago. CNN.com sat down with Regan to learn more about his brand of comedy and what's in store for the future. CNN: How did you become interested in comedy and stand-up? Brian Regan: This isn't the main reason, but when I was in college [Heidelberg College in Ohio], my name was Rip for Rip van Winkle. I had a 7 a.m. class, and I missed it almost every day. I would wake up and run across campus. I remember thinking, \"What's going to happen if I don't wake up for things?\" And then a comedian performed at our college, and I went to the show, and I noticed the show started at 8 p.m. and I was like, well, the hours are good. I can handle a job that starts at 8 p.m. CNN: Who are some of your influences? Regan: I love Steve Martin. He took silliness to a level of brilliance, I think. CNN: How do you get your ideas? Regan: I used to try and sit down with a blank piece of paper. I would stare at the paper, and it just continues to stay blank. I've learned that for me, it's easier for me to go out and live my life and do my thing. CNN: You don't really use the crass language many comedians rely on. Is there a reason for that? Regan: I don't really know those words [laughing]. I used to have a few jokes here and there with a four-letter word in it. I was always 90 to 95 percent clean with my jokes anyways, and I'm kind of anal so, why be 95 percent something when you could be 100 percent something? It worked out, and people really seem to respond to it so I guess that other 5 percent wasn't that important anyways. CNN: Do you try to incorporate the economy into your jokes? Regan: I do a few jokes about the economy but from an everyday person perspective. People like to laugh, and they especially like to laugh during difficult circumstances. One of the best shows in New York I had was the week after 9/11. I was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show. They said people were looking for a diversion. I went up and said I'm not trying to make light of what happened, I'm just trying to forget about it for an hour. I find it's similar to what is happening with the economy. Obviously, it's not as serious as 9/11, but people are looking for an escape. I think people want to laugh. CNN: How can comedy help people through tough times? Regan: I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things. They say a formula for comedy is comedy equals tragedy plus time. A difficult or uncomfortable situation takes place, and then you laugh about it later down the road. Sometimes I wonder if I could be so mentally healthy to subtract the time part. Like what if there is a flat tire, and it's raining outside? Instead of laughing a month later, why not laugh while you are changing tires in the rain? CNN: Your fan base has really grown in the last five years. How does the fame feel? Regan: It's been a slow gradual thing for me. I've never had a single event or television show that did it. I just pick up a couple more fans and a few more fans, and before you know it, it's like hey man, things are going OK. CNN: What's in store for the future? Regan: This is what I like doing, and I will hopefully do it forever. If something else comes along, I'd be open to that. CNN: What about a television show? Regan: I'm not really interested in being an actor. But I would like to get on a television show that would capture my comedy and in that role do a little acting. I'd like to do something that has to do with my comedy.",

Two more soldiers should be court-martialled over hazing that led to the suicide of American soldier Danny Chen, military investigators have recommended. Daniel Schwartz, a 25-year-old first . lieutenant from Maryland and Travis F. Carden,a 25-year-old sergeant . from Fowler, Indiana are among eight soldiers charged in the death of . 19-year-old Danny Chen. The infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October last year after what after what investigators say were weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. Death: Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide . A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, . Mr Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a . guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Mr Chen's relatives say he was . brutally hazed during training because he was Chinese-American. They . have said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous . racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and . sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit . as the rest of the platoon. On the day that he eventually ended . his life, he had forgotten his helmet and his water when he went to . report to the guardhouse. His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 . meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the . while having other soldiers throw rocks at him. The two soldiers were recommended for . courts-martial following a pretrial hearing at Kandahar Air Field on . Sunday. They each face various criminal charges in his death.

        "document": "(CNN)Imagine putting wings on the White House and getting it to fly around the world. It's been done. That's basically Air Force One in a nutshell. Now the Pentagon has announced the next generation of this world-class icon will be a military version of the 747-8. For nearly 30 years, the current jumbo jet Air Force One has been a customized version of the 747-200B. The newer 747-8 is longer and more efficient than its older brother. Why is a new one necessary? \"It is time to upgrade,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement Wednesday. The difference between the civilian version and what the President will fly on: the commander in chief gets a plane that's tricked out with top-of-the-line parts and backup systems. And a lot of technology that's -- well -- classified. Related: What's new about the 747-8? Let's remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel. For more than half a century, passengers aboard the U.S. presidential aircraft have been witness to American history. Consider the fact that all these things happened on an Air Force One: . -- President Kennedy's body was flown to Washington for burial. -- Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president. -- LBJ let a reporter interview him in the plane's stateroom, while dressed only in a towel. -- The only woman ever to swear-in a U.S. president did so aboard Air Force One. -- President Richard Nixon became the first American president to visit China, where he historically opened the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. -- Air Force One served as President George W. Bush's command center during the first hours following the 9/11 attacks. One of the main goals for the new plane, the Air Force said, will be affordability. Although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new 747-8 lists for around $368 million. Add all the presidential bells and whistles and the sticker price goes north rather quickly. The 747-8 is made in the U.S., which the Air Forced hinted was a plus. \"The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities,\" Wednesday's statement said. The four-engine Airbus A380 -- the world's largest airliner -- which is made in France, was thought by some to be Boeing's only competition for Air Force One. When will the President get a new jumbo jet? Hard to say. If everything goes smoothly, Boeing likely will work with the Air Force on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule. In December, Boeing had 36 unfilled orders for 24 passenger versions and 12 freighter models. From humble beginnings as a small, less than impressively outfitted plane during the FDR administration, to its current jumbo jet status, Air Force One has become a world-class icon representing power and privilege. Members of Congress, celebrities and advocates clamor for seats on it, to get rare access to the President -- arguably the most powerful person on the planet. The plane's well-known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy and approved by JFK himself. Officially, the aircraft is only called Air Force One while a sitting president is aboard. The presidential fleet includes several aircraft, other than the two 747s, that from time to time carry the \"Air Force One\" call sign. The presidential helicopter is operated by the Marine Corps and is often seen ferrying the President to and from the South Lawn of the White House. It's called \"Marine One.\" On the rare occasion the President travels by Army aircraft, that is known as \"Army One.\" By the same logic, aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign \"Air Force Two.\" Over the years, the various \"Air Force Ones\" have had their fair share of Hollywood screen roles. For example, the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 Harrison Ford action movie \"Air Force One,\" in which the President's jet is hijacked by Russian nationalists. However, many of the more outlandish gizmos featured in the film owed more to, shall we say, artistic license than to airborne fact. The plane for example has no escape pod. Nor is it equipped with parachutes -- the massive slipstream created by an aircraft the size of a 747 means they can't be used. Designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services, the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling. They carry their own automated baggage loaders as well as built-in front and aft stairs enabling them to operate self-sufficiently at airports and airfields around the world, minimizing security risks. Capable of in-flight refueling from airborne tankers, manufacturers say the aircraft has \"virtually unlimited range\" -- its passengers sustained by galleys capable of storing up to 2,000 meals at a time. The entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of electromagnetic pulse -- a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics. It  features private accommodation, office space and a workout room for the President, first lady and family; as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel. Also on board is a stateroom and conference rooms that can, should it ever be necessary, be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center. CNN's Joe Havely contributed to this report.",

        "document": "The U.S. Marine Corps has quietly walked back a 2012 directive from the service's highest-ranking officer that would have rejected female recruits and officer candidates who can't perform three chin-ups as part of their physical fitness training. The reason – 55 per cent of the women attempting the test are failing. Just one per cent of men can't complete the exercise. 'Women aren’t able to make the minimum standard of three pull-ups,' Marine spokesman Capt. Eric Flanagan told reporters on Friday. The startling admission, and the military's course-correction, came after just three out of 15 females successfully graduated from the Marine Corps' enlisted infantry training course in November. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More than half of the female Marines and Marine recruits tested during 2013 couldn't complete three pull-ups, forcing the Corps to re-evaluate its commitment to gender-neutral physical fitness standards . Gender equality: Politics has played a role in the modernization of the U.S. military, including putting females in combat roles that have always been closed to them -- a change that requires women to meet the same exacting physical standards as men . Females can serve in most Marine units -- combat eligibility will come in 2016 -- but even existing Marines could be discharged from the service if they failed the new pull-up standards in their annual fitness tests . The new rule, set to go into effect on January 1, would have changed the previous requirement – in place for more than a decade – that requires female Marines to execute a 'flexed arm hang', holding on to a pull-up bar with their elbows bent for 70 seconds. 2013 was to be a 'phase one' transitional year, according to a November 2012 directive from Marine Corps commandant Gen. James Amos, with females having a choice of which test to attempt. 'Phase two will commence on 1 January 2014,' Amos had ordered. 'Pull-ups will replace the FAH [flexed arm hang] portion of the PFT [physical fitness test] ... To pass the pull-up portion of this event, females will be required to execute at least three (3) pull-ups.' Now, with a 180-degree pivot in the . face of widespread failures, Marine commanders' early predictions that . the change was a no-brainer seem more optimistic than realistic. In November 2012, Major General Bob Butcher told KGTV-10 in San Diego that women 'are getting closer and closer to combat, and they need to be in top physical condition as well.' General James Amos, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, ordered the tougher fitness standards for females in December 2012, but his January 1, 2014 deadline for implementation won't be met after just three women graduated from infantry training nearly a year later . 'We decided to execute because there is no reason why we shouldn’t do this,' Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills told a reporter for the corps' website a year ago. 'Women are fully capable of accomplishing it. It's more recognition of the changing role of women, the changing capabilities and the changing demands that we place on them.' Mills said then that the Marines would initially set the bar at eight pull-ups for a perfect score, or three for the minimum passing grade, 'and then we will raise or lower that after we see how our female Marines do in the year.' They didn't do so well, according to a report from National Public Radio. As the U.S. armed forces integrate . women into combat roles, some fear putting them in harm's way without . preparing them for the rigors of active fighting. Female Marines will be eligible to participate in  combat-ready forward units in 2016. Marine officers declined to speak with NPR on the record, but conceded the pull-up requirement was being put off because it would cost them both new recruits and active Marines. Females can serve in most Marine units but, just like their male counterparts, they can be discharged from the service if they fail an annual physical fitness tests. The change was to take place in two phases, including giving females the choice through 2013 of sticking with the old standard, which required them to hold on to a bar with their elbows flexed for 70 seconds . Robert Maginnis, a retired Army . lieutenant colonel, told NPR that 'young women, in spite of all the . training and all the best intentions, are not going to be the equal of . young men in terms of upper body strength.' His new book, . 'Deadly Consequences: How Cowards are Pushing Women into Combat,' argues that Pentagon gender politics are sacrificing combat readiness on . the altar of political correctness. Other experts, female Marines among them, insist that women can meet the new standard if they spend enough time in the gym. And 45 per cent of them are making the grade. 'Females need to realize we all have to start somewhere, and we have more than enough time to prepare for this,' Corporal Ada Canizaleztejada told Marines.mil in December 2012. 'About a year ago, I was only doing two pull-ups. I began weightlifting and targeting specific muscles beneficial for doing pull-ups, and now I can do nine.' Corporal Michelle Brinn told a defense website a few weeks earlier that she reached the goal after a half-year of intense workouts. Lance Corporal Ally Beiswanger insisted that she can do eight pull-ups now, a year after being unable to complete just one . Hitting the gym: Nearly half of female Marines are meeting the new standard, but the Corps now says that's not enough -- and is scrapping it for 2014 . 'Six months ago, I couldn’t do one pull-up, my triceps were non-existent, and my biceps were about as hard as a pillow-top mattress,' Brinn confessed. But 'a month into my new workout regimen I was able to perform three proper pull-ups and have since worked my way up to 12,' she said. Lance Corporal Ally Beiswanger, who co-hosts the official 'Corps Report TV' program on YouTube, said in a November 2013 broadcast that 'last year, I could barely do one pull-up, and now I'm up to eight. 'So I'm taking advantage of the extra time to complete my goal of 12.' A Marine Corps Web page set up to help female recruits cope with the new physical fitness standard is still active, but the testing requirement now appears destined to be a historical footnote.",

The sole survivor of the elite firefighter team that perished battling a raging wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona last week paid tribute to his fallen brothers with a heartfelt prayer. At a memorial held Tuesday in Prescott, Arizona, Brendan McDonough took the stage in front of a packed arena of about 8,000 people to recite 'The Hotshot's Prayer.' The prayer, which was written for all Hotshot crews across the U.S., references the dangers the firefighters take when tackling fires in their early stages. Scroll down for video . The Hotshot's Prayer: Brendan McDonough, the sole-survivor of the June 30 incident that killed the other 19 members of his crew, recited a special prayer at the Tuesday memorial . Moved: Biden said he felt a connection with the lost men due to the firefighters who once 'saved my life.' Scout: McDonough survived the fire because he was acting as the crew's lookout. He warned them of the changing weather, but the men just couldn't get out in time . Packed: Tim's Toyota Center in Prescott, Arizona was filled with those who came to honor the departed . 'When I am called to duty, Lord to fight the roaring blaze, please keep me safe and strong, I may be here for days.' The prayer also speaks to the constant possibility of death. 'For if this day on the line I should answer death's call, Lord, bless my hotshot crew, my family, one and all.' At the end of his recitation, McDonough's voice broke as he thanked the massive crowd gathered. 'I miss my brothers,' he said. The . memorial on Tuesday was the last of a series of vigils since the . firefighters' tragic death on June 30, battling an out of control . wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona. Family . members and politicians alike came together to honor the lives of the . nineteen firefighters whose lives were taken in the fire. Sole survivor: McDonough was greeted by both Vice President Biden, left, and the Tim Hill, right, president of the Professional Firefighters of Arizona . Mass mourning: Thousands attended the memorial for the 19 men lost on June 30 . Grieving: McDonough is embraced by Prescott, Arizona Mayor Marlin Kuykendall, while Gov Jan Brewer looks on . When I am called to duty, Lord ...To fight the roaring blaze ...Please keep me safe and strong ...I may be here for days.Be with my fellow crew members ...As we hike up to the top.Help us cut enough line ...For this blaze to stop.Let my skills and hands ...Be firm and quick.Let me find those safety zones ...As we hit and lick.For if this day on the line ...I should answer death's call ...Lord, bless my hot shot Crew ...My family, one and all. McDonough was the lone survivor of his team, because he was assigned to keep watch of the blaze. When McDonough saw that the winds were changing and driving the flames to wrap around his team, he warned the crew. Unfortunately they weren't able to escape fast enough. As a last resort, the 19 firefighters retreated to make-shift shelters. All 19 perished in what was  the largest loss of firefighters battling a wildfire in 80 years, and the most killed in a single incident since 9/11. The Granite Hotshots were an elite unit of firefighters dispatched to battle wildfire's in their early stages. There are other Hotshot teams, mostly in the Western U.S., totaling about 110 men in teams of 20. At the service, each individual firefighter was honored and their family given an American flag. Memorials were set up to honor each of the fallen. Inside the arena images of each Hotshot killed were hung with their uniforms, helmets, boots and single white rose next to each image. Outside the arena another tribute was set up with pictures of the fallen, each with an American flag of their own and purple ribbon with his name. A granite marker read: 'In honor and recognition of all wildland firefighters across this great nation. Duty - Respect - Integrity.' Speakers at the event included Vice President Joe Biden and Arizona Gov Jan Brewer. Against the backdrop of the departed's pictures, Gov . Brewer talked about the great pride she had in the men who lost their lives. 'Of course our hearts are filled with profound sadness today, but they're also filled with great pride,' Brewer said. 'How wonderful is it to know that Arizona was home to 19 men like those we honor today.' She praised the men as heroes who tragically died before their time. 'They . were protectors defending out communities, safeguarding our friends, . family and strangers alike. They were 19 heroes gone at the turn of the . wind,' she said. Team: The Granite Hotshots were just one unit of many Hotshot crews that battle fires in their early stages across the U.S. Other hotshots came out to attend the Tuesday memorial .

One of six maximum security jails in the territory, human rights groups consider Stanley among the toughest prisons in the world, with Jutting held alongside Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers. Having asked to be remanded in prison rather than police custody during a court appearance earlier this week, the 1,714 capacity hellhole jail where Jutting is thought to be incarcerated is a world away from his previous life as high-flying banker, reportedly earning a salary of £350,000 a year.

Out with the girls: The 1,714 capacity hellhole jail where Jutting is now incarcerated is a world about from his previous life as high-flying, hard-partying banker, reportedly earning a salary of £350,000 a year . Jutting is understood to have been transferred to Stanley Prison on Monday afternoon after a judge granted his request to be transferred there rather than continue to be held in police custody. Martyn Richmond, a temporary lawyer assigned to him, complained that police refused to let him contact a lawyer of his choice or the British Consulate while in custody. Mr Richmond said that if Jutting's requests were granted, he 'may well co-operate' with a police reconstruction at the crime scene, which is understood to be planned for Friday. As Jutting has been charged with murder but is yet to face trial, he is unlikely to be held in the main body of the prison where convicted rapists and killers are detained and where gang-related violence is commonplace. Housing both convicted and remand prisoners, Stanley Prison has a staff of more than 800 officers, wardens, medical professionals, canteen and maintenance staff. Welcome: Pictured is the green entrance gate to Hong Kong's Stanley Prison - one of the world's toughest jails . Past: During the Second World War Stanley Prison was used as a detention centre by Japanese forces after it was captured by the invading armies on Christmas Day, 1941 . Notorious: Stanley Prison houses thousands of prisoners, including Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers . Portions: Prisoners' food rations inside Stanley Prison are based on their physical fitness . Inside the prison, all adult prisoners are legally required to work six days a week. Their roles are determined by the crimes they have committed, their physical fitness and the security risk they pose . Built in 1937, Stanley Prison became the oldest active prison in Hong Kong after the ancient Victoria Prison ceased operation in 2005. It was originally designed to hold 1,500 prisoners but space has since been found for an extra 214. During the Second World War Stanley Prison was used as a detention centre by Japanese forces after it was captured by the invading armies on Christmas Day, 1941. From this period up until the early 1990s, the prison population is understood to have routinely topped 3,000 - twice the number it was built to house. As a prisoner of war camp it became notorious as a place of torture and execution, with Mateen Ahmed Ansari - an Indian army captain - posthumously awarded the George Cross after being beaten, starved and eventually executed by Japanese troops who unsuccessfully demanded that he renounce his allegiance to the British army and sow seeds of discontent among his comrades. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians killed by the Japanese during the occupation are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery. Both of the young women found murdered in the apartment of British 'psycho baker' Rurik Jutting came from impoverished families in Indonesia and arrived in Hong Kong as domestic workers. Like the hundreds of thousands of young Thai, Filipino and Indonesian women who flock there, both Sumarti Ningsih, and Seneng Mujiasih were mainly attracted by Hong Kong's higher wages. Sumarti Ningsih married young and worked as a nanny in her town of Cilacap, but the couple struggled to find enough to eat, according to Time. Victims: Like the hundreds of thousands of young Thai, Filipino and Indonesian women who flock there, both Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Seneng Mujiasih (right) were mainly attracted by Hong Kong's higher wages . After giving birth to a son at the age of 18 in 2009, she is understood to have travelled to Hong Kong, ending her marriage and leaving her child in the care of her farmer parents. She found work as a domestic worker and earned enough money to be able to send £150 back to her family every month - more than twice the total amount she was earning back home. Miss Ningsih soon moved on to work as a waitress in a restaurant and took a DJ course to help boost her income. All the while she continued sending large sums of money back to her family to help them pay for her son's education. However her frequent journeys between Hong Kong and her family home Indonesia had a negative impact. On her last visit to the territory she was only granted a tourist visa, forcing her to start working illegally. Despite media reports to the contrary her family insist she never resorted to prostitution and continued to find cash-in-hand employment as a waitress until her murder last week. Seneng Mujiasih's background was strikingly similar. She left her parents' home  of island of Sulawesi at some point in the mid-2000s but ran into difficulty when her then employer terminated her contract as a domestic worker in 2011. Fearing that her dream of saving enough money to buy a house for her parents would lie in tatters if she returned to low wages in Indonesia, Miss Mujiasih also embraced the world of illegal work. Living in a run-down boarding house just yards from Rurik Jutting's flashy apartment she, like so many other young foreign women in Hong Kong, began to seek cash in any way she could - including working as a part-time prostitute.

Although the death penalty was formally abolished in Hong Kong in 1993, Stanley Prison previously saw frequent executions. A total of 122 people were killed there between 1946 and the 1966. While the death penalty is commonly used in China, Hong Kong continued to operate under a different set of laws after Britain handed the territory over to China in July 1997. Inside the prison, all adult prisoners are legally required to work six days a week. Their roles are determined by the crimes they have committed, their physical fitness and the security risk they pose. The quality of the work is then assessed and the prisoners rewarded with a payment system that allows them to buy rewards such as library books, television viewing time and newspapers. Despite the brutal history of the prison, the Stanley peninsula on which it sits - known locally as Chek Chue - is one of the territory's most popular tourist locations, particularly around Stanley Market. A picturesque home for many wealthy Western expats, Stanley is lined with expensive Victorian-era properties, many of which overlook St Stephen's Bay - considered among the best beaches in China.

        "document": "By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 07:32 EST, 29 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:37 EST, 29 January 2014 . A cystic fibrosis sufferer has beaten the odds to become a personal trainer. Sophie Holmes, 22, has overcome the debilitating illness to realise her dream of working in fitness. She believes pushing herself physically has helped her manage her cystic fibrosis. Sophie Holmes (right) overcame cystic fibrosis to set up a personal training business with sister, Anna (left) The condition can cause major lung damage and digestive problems, with the average life expectancy for sufferers being just 40 years. Ms Holmes’ current fitness is a huge turn around as just three years ago she spent three weeks in hospital critically ill after her lung capacity dropped to 60 per cent. Against the odds she pulled through, but her near death experience made her realise she needed to take her health more seriously. ‘Lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics, I made a vow to myself to make my health a priority,’ she said. ‘Seeing my health deteriorate so quickly was frightening to me. I knew I had to do something to make sure I was never ill like this again.’ In the days and weeks that followed she researched ways to combine her health with her job, and decided to become a personal trainer. Ms Holmes made the decision to become a personal trainer when she was in hospital seriously ill. She says her illness, which was caused by cystic fibrosis, made her realise she needed to start putting her health first . Ms Holmes said: 'Lying in a hospital bed with an intravenous line in my arm feeding me antibiotics, I made a vow to myself to make my health a priority' She said: ‘I thought that being a personal trainer would be a great way to make my health my life. ‘It would be my job to look after my health, so I wouldn’t have any excuses to not take care of myself.’ Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat the infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. Life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Holmes turned to her elder sister, Anna Holmes, 24, for support with her dream. Amazingly, Anna quit her job at a children’s nursery to help her sister reach her goal. 'She was my best friend and I knew I’d find it hard with my illness,’ says Ms Holmes. ‘I thought having Anna’s support would spur me on. I knew there was no turning back when she said let’s do it together.’ Together the sisters trained to become personal trainers with Premier Training International, and now they run their own business, Southend-on-Sea based Holmes Sisters Personal Training - and are making thousands a year. Growing up, Ms Holmes would always take part in sports and enjoyed tennis, hockey and netball at school, alongside managing her illness with daily physiotherapy and medication. But in 2011, when she was just 19, she became critically ill after her lungs filled with mucus. ‘It came out of the blue and was absolutely terrifying,’ says Ms Holmes. ‘Before being admitted, I’d been active as usual, riding my horse Otis and going to the gym. ‘But I was having difficulty breathing and went to the GP, and then discovered the CF, which until then I’d always held at bay, had taken a huge turn for the worse.’ She was rushed to hospital and spent three week hooked up to a heart monitor, being drip fed antibiotics to clear her lungs. While in hospital, she lost a stone in weight, dropping to just eight stone. While lying in bed at the Royal . Brompton Hospital she made a vow to do everything she could to improve . her health, and live a long and fulfilling life. She . said: ‘Being in hospital was horrible. I felt so weak and I was . terrified cystic fibrosis was going to get the better of me. ‘I knew I never wanted to feel like this again, so I stopped moping in self-pity and did something about it. Ms Holmes (left) believes her physical fitness has helped her to avoid becoming unwell again. She hopes it will help her to live a long and fulfilling life despite her illness . ‘Cardiovascular exercise can help CF sufferers, and I wanted to make it a fundamental part of my life to give myself the best shot.’ Now, after qualifying in May 2013 as a personal trainer, she has set up her own business with her sister and the pair help others reach their fitness goals every day. She says: ‘I’m determined to not let . cystic fibrosis stop me from pursuing my dreams. With the help and . support of my sister, I really feel as though I’ve been able to achieve . my goals and hope I can others achieve theirs. Ms Holmes said: 'You can do anything when you put your mind to it. Although my illness is serious, I don't believe it has to define me as a person, and now look how far I have come' ‘I couldn’t have done it without Anna, she supported me the whole way and helped me train when I was feeling low. She’s the best sister I could have asked for.’ ‘You can do anything when you put your mind to it. Although my illness is serious, I don’t believe it has to define me as a person, and now look how far I have come. ‘People who suffer from cystic fibrosis shouldn’t let it hold them back. Now I want to inspire others to reach their potential and beyond.’",

        "document": "\"Sport has the power to change the world,\" Nelson Mandela once said -- and the South African prisoner-turned-president also provided perhaps the most eloquent supporting evidence for his claim. \"It has the power to inspire,\" he said. \"It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers.\" That last sentence was the closest Mandela came to referencing his own role in using sport to unify South Africa, a country that had been separated by skin color and the warped political ideology of apartheid for nearly half a century by the time he became its first black president in 1994. A year after winning South Africa's first multiracial elections, and five years after his release from prison after nearly three decades of incarceration for his anti-apartheid activities, the then-African National Congress leader revealed his acute political antennae as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The sport had long been seen as the white man's game in South Africa, and many non-whites identified the national team, the Springboks, as being synonymous with minority rule. The team's antelope emblem had been proudly worn by the country's whites-only sporting teams during apartheid. As the onetime pariah state found itself in the unusual position of welcoming the world, there were widespread fears of a racial bloodbath. Some groups were keen to avenge the years of racial oppression, while some right-wing whites were plotting violent protests against the new black majority rule. Despite their readmission in 1992 to international rugby, after years of apartheid-enforced sporting isolation, South Africa used home advantage so well that the debutants reached the World Cup final. The sporting, political and human drama was told in John Carlin's book \"Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation\" and was made into the movie \"Invictus,\" with Morgan Freeman playing Mandela. Carlin tells the story of the moment on the day of the final when white South Africans took a man they once considered a terrorist into their hearts. \"The day's crowning moment came before the game had even begun, when Mandela went out onto the field, before a crowd of 65,000 that was 95% white, wearing the green Springbok jersey, the old symbol of oppression, beloved of his apartheid jailers,\" he wrote. \"There was a moment of jaw-dropping disbelief, a sharp collective intake of breath, and suddenly the crowd broke into a chant, which grew steadily louder, of 'Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!'\" Two hours later, the day's images adopted iconic status as the \"Rainbow Nation\" beat New Zealand to win the tournament, precipitating widespread celebrations, increased harmony and a mixture of both pride and hope to a South Africa in desperate need of reconciliation. The photo of team captain Francois Pienaar receiving the trophy from Mandela, who was wearing the No. 6 jersey associated with the Springboks' Afrikaner skipper, now takes a place of pride at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. Nonetheless, Dr. Ashwin Desai, a university lecturer, sociologist and specialist in South Africa's racial history, believes that the impact of the moment was short-lived and began to crumble within a few months of the final. \"The Rainbow Nation and Mandela's legacy was supposed to be about the erosion of racial categories, but that has not happened,\" said Desai. \"This idea that sport can harmonize a nation is a cliché that South Africans use -- but we also know that sport can divide. The kindest thing to say about the dream of the Rainbow Nation is that it has been deferred -- more realistically though, the dream has been shattered. What we have now is deepening racial division, with racial categories being pre-eminent again.\" Yet one of the most celebrated pages in modern race relations would never have been written had Mandela not saved the Springbok emblem, which was labeled \"deeply offensive\" by the National Sport Council in the mid-1990s because of its use in the racially divisive past. Recognizing that whites had lost both their national flag and the elevated status of their national anthem, Mandela understood their need to retain some identity -- and so the pacifier persuaded his colleagues that the Springboks' survival was key to building the new South Africa. Mandela won the argument despite the Springboks' history of breaking the international sporting ban that the ANC had successfully forced on many South African teams during apartheid. Even though he had backed the boycott from his prison cell on Robben Island, Mandela was aware of the sacrifices imposed on his nation's best sportsmen. \"I wanted my people to know that I became president sooner because of the sacrifices made by our athletes during the years of the boycott,\" he replied when asked why he was at a soccer match involving South Africa, rather than a politically themed event, shortly after his inauguration in May 1994. Two years later, Mandela and South Africa repeated the trick -- this time with soccer, the game that was the main preserve of the country's black community. With Mandela now draped in the football jersey, South Africa used home soil to win the Africa Cup of Nations, the continent's premier football event, at the first time of asking. Yet Mandela's true football legacy came when South Africa was awarded the honor of staging the 2010 World Cup finals, beating favorites Morocco 14-10 in the final vote. \"The presence of Mandela when we were making our bid was very, very powerful,\" said Desai. \"We were up against some big, powerful nations, such as Morocco and Egypt, so to beat off Morocco meant there had to be an extra player on the team -- and certainly the major game-changer was Mandela.\" \"It is thanks to Mandela that the world could finally trust us to deliver this event at a world class level,\" Danny Jordaan told the FIFA website. \"He gave us a momentum and self-belief that we could achieve what many thought was impossible and we, and this country, will be forever grateful.\" Despite a personal tragedy on the eve of the finals -- his great-granddaughter Zenani, 13, died in a car crash -- Mandela was ultimately rewarded with a tournament that shone with color, originality and, to widespread surprise outside South Africa, fine organization. Within Africa, many said they felt an increased sense of belonging as the football World Cup, which dates back to 1930, finally arrived in Africa -- the first time the continent had hosted a global event on the scale of the Olympics. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hailed Mandela as an \"extraordinary person\" on Thursday and recalled the ecstatic scenes at the 2010 World Cup's closing ceremony in what proved to be Mandela's final public appearance. \"When he was honored and cheered by the crowd at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium on 11 July 2010, it was as a man of the people, a man of their hearts, and it was one of the most moving moments I have ever experienced. For him, the World Cup in South Africa truly was 'a dream come true,'\" Blatter said in a statement on FIFA's website. \"Nelson Mandela will stay in our hearts forever. The memories of his remarkable fight against oppression, his incredible charisma and his positive values will live on in us and with us.\" Former South African international, Lucas Radebe also paid a moving tribute. \"The sports history books in South Africa will show statistics and victories. What they won't show, however, was that it was Madiba Magic that forged those results and performances; and united a country and its people along the way. No doubt, that Madiba Magic will live on. Thank you Tata,\" Radebe wrote on his website. This sense of belonging is one that Mandela maintained with his foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which started the Sport for Good program with the aim of using sport as a way of improving the lives of children in both South Africa and Swaziland. This sporting philosophy had served Mandela himself exceptionally well during his time in prison. In his biography, \"A Long Walk to Freedom,\" he explained how he followed a highly disciplined exercise regime in a bid to stay both physically and mentally healthy. \"I have always believed that exercise is a key not only to physical health, but to peace of mind,\" wrote the once-keen boxer and long-distance runner. \"Exercise dissipates tension, and tension is the enemy of serenity.\" \"In prison, having an outlet for my frustrations was absolutely essential. Even on the island, I attempted to follow my old boxing routine of doing roadwork and muscle-building from Monday to Thursday and then resting for the next three days.\" The efficacy of his discipline -- which also included 45 minutes of running \"on the spot in my cell\" and extensive anaerobic exercise four times a week -- was clear to see in the energy he brought to life as a free man -- keeping together the fragile, new South Africa, visiting world leaders and becoming one of the political icons of our time. After 27 years behind bars, where he was allowed just one visitor a year, perhaps it was only fair that the world then came to visit Mandela in later years -- with Pele, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Alex Ferguson, Tiger Woods and David Beckham prominent among the sporting luminaries to meet the icon. Like the wider world, sport is unlikely to forget Mandela, not just because of the tournaments and stadiums already named in his honor, but primarily for a day in 1995 when the anti-apartheid activist stole the show during the defeat of a team called, ironically enough, the All Blacks.

A Chinese school has solved its problem with a lack of space for a school sports day by using the emergency lane of a nearby motorway. The Xingguo School, in Guiyang, Guizhou province, is a school that mainly has children from rural migrant workers in the city and therefore does not have a lot of resources. It did have a small playground, but this ended up being built on, leaving the kids with nowhere to exercise until teachers came up with the bright idea of using part of the local motorway.

        "document": "By . Patrick Strudwick . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:59 EST, 9 November 2013 . It’s called Transformational Breathing, the latest health craze to hit Hollywood – and it’s something I had no doubt was total nonsense. Goldie Hawn uses it ‘to manage stress’, and has now introduced it to her daughter Kate Hudson. Naomie Harris, star of Skyfall and Mandela, the forthcoming biopic about Nelson Mandela, also swears by it. Would that kind of endorsement alone persuade me to attend a  class in a breathing technique  that claims to be able to help depression, chronic pain, migraine, insomnia, anxiety and even asthma? Probably not. But two things have convinced me to attend a session hosted by Alan Dolan, aka ‘the breath guru’, in North London. Easy breathing: Both Kate Hudson and Naomie Harris use Transformational Breathing to help them stay calm and manage stress in their whirlwind Hollywood lives . First, studies show that meditation, which uses breath control, is not only effective in treating anxiety, it physically alters the structure of the brain to make you more emotionally stable. Second, I have a long, illustrious history of anxiety. My 20s were blighted by unbearable panic attacks and an anxiety disorder that triggered a four-year addiction to sleeping pills. An array of treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy, brought it largely under control. It’s years since I had a panic attack, but every now and then anxiety can grip me, manifesting in hypochondria, insomnia or stress that leaves me unable to concentrate or even vaguely enjoy myself. I’ve tried meditation before but I always give up as I don’t ever feel it’s doing anything. Now I’ve decided to place my faith in Alan, a slight 50-year-old with a goatee and a soothing voice. He describes the mechanics of the technique. ‘First of all, the inhalation and exhalation are of different lengths – about three to one. Hands-on approach: Alan Dolan - the so called 'breath guru' - teaches Transformational Breathing in one of his London classes . ‘If you breathe in slowly for three counts or three seconds you exhale quickly for one – imagine you are trying to steam up some glass. ‘The longer inhale allows you to access more oxygen and energy. The exhale allows you to access any emotional energy that’s been held  in the system. It’s like clearing out  the trash.’ The next rule is to breathe with your mouth open – fairly wide, so you could at least fit a finger between your teeth. Alan says this helps increase the volume of air breathed in and out. ‘The other vital aspect is that you don’t hold the breath at the peak of inhalation or exhalation but keep it moving. That’s what puts you into an altered state of consciousness.’ Anyone prone to anxiety is generally welcoming of any state other than an anxious one, so I keep listening. Alan instructs me to sit down with my back against some cushions, to close my eyes, open my mouth and place my hand on the bottom of my abdomen so I can feel it rise up each time I breathe in. This ensures the diaphragm is used more than the upper part of the lungs, which are deployed during exercise or panicky breathing.  Initially I can’t do it. There is so much to think about – keeping your hand on your belly, your mouth wide open, sticking to the unnatural rhythm of the longer inhale while also keeping the breath moving. My mouth becomes dry and my mind and body try to revolt against this strange process. But Alan encourages me to keep going and gradually I find the rhythm. The further into the session we go, the more strange things start to happen. First I crave indulgent food such as chocolate fondant. Then my body temperature seems to rise. I start sweating. Tingling is next, flooding up from my fingers through my arms, and through my feet into my shins. After what seems like about 15 minutes Alan tells me to bring my breathing back to a slow, regular rhythm and gently open my eyes. That’s when the most dramatic effect becomes apparent. Everything is slow – my mind, my reactions, my movements. The sense of calm is profound. It is, for want of a less hippy word, blissful. ‘How long was I doing that for?’ I ask. ‘An hour,’ replies Alan. For the rest of the evening I luxuriate in delicious, euphoric calm. The next day I’m back to normal but with one chief difference: I know that by changing my breathing I can feel dramatically different. In the days that follow, when I feel stressed or unable to sleep, I take Alan’s advice and practise it on my own for ten minutes. It works, although not to the same level of calm as the first time, presumably because I’m only doing it for a fraction of the time. Much of this is similar to the effects noticed by devotees of meditation, and yet the technique is different. So what could be happening physiologically? Dr Oliver Firth, who specialises in treating divers with decompression sickness, explains: ‘It’s a rising carbon dioxide level that triggers a breath. By deliberately slowing down your breathing, carbon dioxide levels build up in the body, and carbon dioxide does have quite a soporific effect on people, causing them to feel relaxed.’ This is, however, still debated. But I’m in no doubt: where meditation failed, transformational breathing succeeded. It’s the pill I wish I’d had all along. For more information, visit breathguru.com .",

Oakland Raiders running back Maurice Jones-Drew (centre) is set to return from injury against Miami . ‘This week I feel great: punching, doing everything, taking care of the ball with my right hand. ‘If it was up to me I would have played two weeks ago, but obviously I don’t have the final say here, so it’s one of those deals.’ Head coach Dennis Allen backed up Jones-Drew, adding: ‘I think he’s in a better spot now than he was two weeks ago and even where he was last week.

So hopefully myself coming in to try and run the ball a little bit and protect it and catch the ball in the backfield will help us out a little bit.’ The Raiders received a boost in the shape of linebacker Miles Burris returning to limited practice.

Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. Ed Rollins says failing to find the WMDs in Iraq was far more than a disappointment. NEW YORK (CNN) -- One week from today, a historic presidency begins and a tarnished presidency ends. The inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African-American president, cannot come quickly enough for the vast majority of Americans. This young man with the keen disciplined mind and the buffed body begins a presidency with high hopes, goodwill and a never-ending list of problems left on the Oval Office desk by George Walker Bush, the ever-confident occupant of that high office who seems like the dinner guest who will not leave. In all my years around Washington as an observer and as a member of several administrations, I have rarely witnessed an event as bizarre as President Bush's farewell press conference yesterday. It reminded me of Richard Nixon's November 17, 1973, question and answer session before 400 Associated Press managing editors at the height of the Watergate scandal, in which he declared: \"People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.\" Well, to the best of my knowledge, Nixon wasn't a crook (in the technical sense). He was dishonest, he abused the office of the presidency, and telling the truth wasn't his strong suit. And he resigned in disgrace and would have been impeached if he hadn't. But there were also periods in his presidency that were very good for this country and the world. President Bush is not a crook either. And even more importantly, I don't believe he is dishonest or an incompetent. The mistakes of his presidency were caused by overconfidence, bad information or a certain arrogance that was still fully on display yesterday. How can you reflect on going to war, a war of choice, and argue that \"not finding weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment,\" as President Bush did yesterday? And putting the \"not finding the weapons\" in the same breath as \"We shouldn't have hung the sign, 'Mission Accomplished' \"! A disappointment is when you're a football fan and your team lost in the playoffs or in the national championship game. Eliminating weapons of mass destruction was the rationale for sending hundreds of thousands of men and women to Iraq to risk their lives and spending billions of dollars of American taxpayers' money. Find out how some readers are angry over Bush's legacy . The rationale for the war wasn't that Saddam Hussein was a bad guy -- which he was -- and that he violated every sanction and agreement that the United Nations put on him. President Bush went on to say: \"One thing about the presidency is that you can only make decisions based on the information at hand. You don't get to have information after you make the decision -- that's not the way it works.\" That is correct and that may be the most important lesson our new president can learn from the failures of the last. Make sure you get the information to make the right decisions. President Bush, referring to the Abu Ghraib scandal and the missing weapons of mass destruction, said, \"I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but things didn't go as planned, let's put it that way.\" The lesson for President-elect Obama is often things don't go as planned. Last week four men who have been president had lunch in the White House with the newly elected president. As I looked at the picture of the five members of the most exclusive club in the world standing in the Oval Office, I felt sad. Two of the men, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, now in their 80s, had been overwhelmingly defeated in their bids for re-election. President Clinton and President Bush, both in their 60s, had periods of great failure. President Clinton was impeached. The present president leaves office with the lowest approval ratings in modern history. None of these were bad men -- just the opposite. Why did their presidencies not live up to those high expectations that we all have for our new leaders on Inauguration Day? In some cases, they fought their natural allies. President Carter was particularly inept at dealing with Congress; so was the current President Bush. Carter and the two Bushes failed at communicating with the public and were unable to articulate what their programs were and build support for them in Congress. Clinton, a good communicator, was terribly undisciplined. President Obama will need to set his priorities early. He can't do all he's promised in the first term. He needs to build strong relationships with the Congress and let them play a big role in setting his agenda. He needs to use his tremendous communication skills and continually explain to the country what he wants to do and why. Then he needs to take his campaign machine and motivate the grassroots organization he built to get Congress to support his programs. He must be patient but persistent in making his case. As we hope for the change which is coming next week, I just want to pause and reflect and say to President Bush, \"Thank you, for serving your country.\" To our new president: Best of luck and you have our prayers.

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of actor Jason Patric's son, Gus, has made some shocking allegations against the actor as the two currently are engaged in a bitter custody battle over the boy, for whom Patric was only supposed to be a 'sperm donor.' In an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle Schreiber claims that Patric is unstable, abusive and made anti-Semitic comments about her and others. The author of the lengthy profile of Patric's judicial rival concedes early in her report that she is a 'friendly acquaintance' of Schreiber. Abused: Danielle Schreiber says Patric abused her both physically and emotionally . Gus: In the midst of a nasty custody battle, Schreiber claims Patric was abusive . Schreiber tells the magazine that Patric was only supposed to be a sperm donor so she could have a child and raise it - even if that meant doing so as a single parent. She also outlines some of the abuse she claims she suffered at the hands of the man who is a leader in the fathers'-rights movement. 'In September 2005, after Schreiber upset Patric, she claims he used . force against her for the first time, grabbing her wrists and pushing . her toward a wall in his Santa Monica home, which resulted in Schreiber . slamming her head,' reporter Vanessa Grigoriadis writes in her piece. 'The next morning, Jason called me and told me he . loved me, for the first time,' Schreiber says. Fathers' rights: Patric has become the face of the fathers rights movement as a result of his legal actions to get custody of his son . In another violent encounter, 'Patric was . sports-betting and drinking, even peeing on a dresser and another time . in a closet at his New York home. She claims Patric threw a jar of . almond butter at her when he found she hadn't put on the lid tight, and . hit her in the face with a land-line phone, causing contusions and . bruises that lasted more than a week.' She claims that Patric also broke his hand when he punched a wall in the middle of one of their fights. The couple broke up in 2008, but reconciled in 2011. According to Schreiber, the abuse continued. '[H]e turned nasty on her again, hurling anti-Semitic epithets like \"Ms. Jew Schreiber\" and \"Jew c***\" at her. (According to an e-mail obtained . by Rolling Stone that appears to be from Patric, he commented, \"F*** . THOSE JEW MOTHERF*****S,\" while discussing a business issue with . Schreiber.),' Grigoriadis writes. Denied: Patric denied all of Schreiber's allegations in the Rolling Stone article outlining the alleged abuse . The couple again broke up after their brief reconciliation, at which point Patric filed a paternity suit demanding shared custody of Gus. Patric responded to the allegations with a statement to the magazine. All these false allegations against me from [Schreiber] and her legal . team are baseless and without merit. They are an attempt to disparage me . after their loss in the Court of Appeal. I will not legitimize the . questions posed by Rolling Stone. There isn't one shred of evidence to . any of this slander…. I will happily present all of my evidence at . trial, and will very soon have Gus back in my arms. I also will continue . to refuse to disparage my son's mother in public. I don't intend to . alienate him from her. The only one that is hurt by this is Gus.

Code can also indicate whether the house is wealthy, has already been burgled or has something worth stealing . By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:57 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:11 EST, 5 September 2013 . Burglars are using coded chalk symbols to let other criminals know whether a property is worth targeting. The marks, dubbed the Da Pinci Code, are made by would-be thieves to indicate if the house is vulnerable, revealing who is living in the house and whether there is anything worth stealing. Chillingly one sign, in the shape of an open book, says a . vulnerable female resident is the occupant and another symbol indicates a homeowner who is ‘nervous and afraid’. Code: Would-be criminals scrawl the markings on properties to indicate whether the house is worth targeting . The chalk markings were spotted on the side of a pensioner’s home in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Police are now investigating the shapes after speaking to other residents in the area and have distributed leaflets in the area warning of the symbols. The code has been previously been spotted in other parts of the country. Targeted: The chalk marks were seen on the side of an elderly person's home in Walkden, Greater Manchester . Resembling washing instructions with a series of crosses, circles and boxes, they have been found on walls and surfaces of homes as well as pavements and kerbs. A simple 'X' means the home is a good target, while the same symbol outlined with a circle means there is nothing worth stealing in the property. A capital D with a dash drawn in it indicates that burgling the house is too risky, while five circles in the shape of a star shows that a property is wealthy. Other marks reveal if a house is alarmed or has already been burgled. Salford police are now urging people who have noticed these symbols to take a picture and then wash them off the property as soon as possible. Police launched their investigation after receiving a report from an elderly woman on Sunday, August 25. Chief inspector Sue Downey said: 'Police in Salford received a call from a woman in Walkden, who was concerned that a symbol had been marked on her house in chalk. 'Enquiries have been carried out and residents in the surrounding area have been spoken to, and we have received no further reports of any such activity. 'We always ask the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police, which we will investigate. 'On this occasion we can find no link between the chalk symbol at this address and any criminality.' In January, police in Torbay, Devon, posted the symbols on Twitter in a bid to warn homeowners that they may be a target for thieves. In 2009, the affluent suburb of Tandridge in Surrey was also targeted by similar markings.",

        "document": "Dachaoshan, China (CNN) -- Rural China intrigued me because I have never lived there before. The only memory I have is from when I was a child. When I was in primary school, one of my distant relatives died and I attended her funeral in a village in Zhejiang province. I remembered the wooden houses, running dogs and chickens, and the smelly latrine â€” I always feared that I would fall into it. I also tripped a million times on the muddy and rocky roads. I guess I am the Alice who didn't go down the rabbit hole until older. After I arrived in Dachaoshan, a tiny town of 17,000 people, in August 2012, what shocked me most was not the stunning beauty of the terraced fields or the fact that most residents here lived below the poverty line, but how globalized everyone was. More than 10 cell phone stores were crowded into the condensed downtown area. Young people wore fake Armani and Gucci clothing and used smart phones that resembled iPhones. They played \"Gangnam Style\" by South Korean rapper Psy at loud volume and watched NBA together on TV. However, I never saw a single person hold a newspaper or a book outside the school I was assigned to. The only reading materials are either about pig feed and pesticide or the family planning campaign. Families don't attach much importance to education and many students quit even though education is compulsory until the age of 16. At the beginning of the school year, 68 students registered in my 7th grade class of 12 and 13-year-olds. At the end of my first year, the number had dropped to 54. Most of the drop-outs became underage migrant workers in nearby cities; some stayed at home to farm. Two girls I knew got married and are now bearing babies. The ones who chose to stay were not easy to teach either. Due to a lack of early education and a poor academic foundation, many students are far behind the curriculum. Every day, I felt like coaching 54 teenagers afraid of walking to run a marathon with me. Together we faced many difficulties, such as lack of motivation and a sense of inferiority. It's hard to blame the parents. I held a parent conference at the beginning of the school year. The parents of 42 of the 54 students showed up. When I asked them to sign their names, half of them couldn't and had to ask my student to help write; the other half who could kind of did it with shaky hands and squiggly handwriting. I visited the homes of my students more than 70 times in my first year of teaching and got to know more about the community. They live in houses made of wood or cement. Even though electricity is available; families still use firewood or dried corn stalks as fuel to cook so the kitchen usually looks dark and smoky. In almost all encounters with parents, I felt hospitality and respect. They seemed to trust me in every educational decision made for their kids, even though I am an outsider and much younger than them and I occasionally needed translation to understand the local dialect. Many of the parents told me: Please scold and beat my son or daughter whenever necessary. You cannot blame local teachers either. Even though they earned an unexpectedly low salary, had a heavy class load, and worked for six days a week, some made time to learn and improve their teaching. They eagerly came to observe my classes and asked for advice about how to make their classes lively and engaging. They also celebrated my birthday with me and invited me to events like karaoke and barbecues. I felt grateful for their acceptance and the responsibilities offered to me. This semester my classroom was equipped with a \"smart' whiteboard and a computer but students still have to share dilapidated wooden desks due to lack of funds. Before I joined Teach for China, I wanted to pursue academic study in anthropology. This goal has changed due to my experience in the classroom. I fell in love with teaching. I want to become an exceptionally excellent teacher -- a person who listens to and answers her students' needs, who kindles a fire to learn in each kid and turns every possible moment into a learning fiesta.

        "document": "By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 1:29 PM on 16th November 2011 . Cheek-to-cheek and hand-in-hand as they met on a wind-swept airport runway, they only had eyes for each other. And if Australia's prime minister Julia Gillard was half-hearted when she welcomed the Queen to her country last month, she certainly did not hold back with Barack Obama. The pair exchanged a warm embrace on the tarmac at Canberra airport as the president flew in for a whirlwind visit before heading on to Indonesia. Entente cordiale: Australian prime minister Julia Gillard greets Barack Obama as he arrives in Canberra for a whirlwind visit . G'Day: Barack Obama kisses Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard as Governor General Quentin Bryce, right, smiles, on his arrival in Canberra . Reception: Mr Obama was also greeted by Australian Governor General Quentin Bryce (right) and US Ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich (second from left) They later held a joint press conference in which they unveiled . plans to deepen the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific, with . 2,500 U.S. marines operating out of a de facto base in northern . Australia. U.S. troops and aircraft will operate . out of the tropical city of Darwin, only 820 kms from Indonesia, able . to respond quickly to any humanitarian and security issues in Southeast . Asia, where disputes over sovereignty of the South China Sea are causing . rising tensions. 'With my visit to the region, I am . making it clear that the United States is stepping up its commitment to . the entire Asia-Pacific region,' Mr Obama said. 'It is appropriate for us to make . sure...that the security architecture for the region is updated for the . 21st century and this initiative is going to allow us to do that.' Biggest fan: Mrs Gillard smiles up at Mr Obama during a press conference in Canberra . Partnership: Mr Obama revealed that U.S. troops are to be stationed in Australia for the first time since World War Two . Light touch: The pair exit the stage after holding the press conference . Mr Obama said he was deeply concerned about the euro zone crisis and warned that market turmoil would continue until Europe has a concrete plan to deal with its sovereign debt worries. His comments came as equity markets fell in response to a sell-off in euro zone bond markets. 'Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we are going to continue to see the kinds of market turmoil we saw,' he said. He added that while there had been progress in putting together unity governments in Italy and Greece, Europe still faced a 'problem of political will' rather than a technical problem. 'We're going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part. 'Ultimately, what they are going to need is a firewall that sends a clear signal - we stand behind the European project, we stand behind the euro.' The U.S. deployment to Australia is . likely to add to China's concerns that Washington is trying to encircle . it with bases in Japan and South Korea and now troops in Australia. But Mr Obama stressed that China was not being isolated. 'The notion that we fear China is . mistaken. The notion that we are looking to exclude China is mistaken,' he said, adding China was not being excluded from the planned . Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) on trade. 'We welcome a rising, peaceful . China,' he added before saying that the country's rising power means it . must take on greater responsibilities to ensure free trade and security . in the region. 'It's important for them to play by . the rules of the road and, in fact, help underwrite the rules that have . allowed so much remarkable economic progress,' he said. The U.S. deployment to Australia, the . largest since World War Two, will start next year with a company of . 200-250 marines in Darwin, the 'Pearl Harbour of Australia', Mrs Gillard . said. More bombs were dropped on Darwin during a surprise Japanese raid than on Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. A total of 2,500 U.S. troops would . eventually rotate through the port city. The United States will bring in . ships, aircraft and vehicles, as well as increase military training. China has already expressed concern about the plan. An . editorial in The Global Times, a government-controlled paper, warned . that Australia could be 'caught in the crossfire' if it allowed the U.S. to use its military bases to harm Chinese interests. Pomp and ceremony: The pair attended a parliamentary dinner in Canberra to mark Mr Obama's visit . Sharing a joke: The pair appeared to be enjoying themselves during the evening . Pledge: Mrs Gillard watches as Mr Obama sings the U.S. national anthem . Dinner: President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard walk to their table at Parliament House . Mr Obama landed in Australia amid a security alert after it emerged documents indicating possible locations he could visit were left in view. Documents detailing places that U.S. secret service agents had visited in order to check out possible locations the the Commander in Chief could visit while in the city were left on the front seat of an unmanned old van - visible to anyone who peered in. There could have been major security problems if the papers had been viewed by terrorists who could have targeted the buildings should they have been chosen as places to visit by the President. A team of local drivers employed by the U.S. secret service was asked to drop their time sheets, detailing schools and others buildings they had taken agents to, through the window of the van which was parked at the rear of a hotel. One local driver claimed he was sacked for refusing to send timesheets - showing where a U.S. agent from the U.S Department of Homeland Security had been - unaccompanied in a taxi to the hotel car park where the papers were to be dropped through the van's window. That particular time sheet detailed suburbs and buildings that the agent had visited last week, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported. The driver said the papers revealed various places the agent had visited to check them out on behalf of the President. China stands for 'peaceful . development and cooperation'. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said . when asked about the proposed deepening of military cooperation. 'We also believe that the external . policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines,' Liu told a regular news briefing in Beijing. Some Asian nations are likely to . welcome the U.S. move as a counterbalance to China's growing military . power, especially its expanding maritime operations, and a reassurance . that Washington will not scale back its engagement in the region due to a . stretched U.S. military budget. 'The United States hopes to . militarily strengthen alliance relations with Japan in the north and . with Australia in the south, with the clear intention of . counter-balancing China,' Su Hao, the director of the Asia-Pacific . Researcher Centre at the Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the . Global Times, a popular Chinese newspaper. The winding down of wars in . Afghanistan and Iraq has opened the door to greater U.S. attention to . simmering tension over the South China Sea, a shipping lane for more . than $5 trillion in annual trade that the United States wants to keep . open. Obama plans to raise maritime . security in the South China Sea at a regional summit on Bali this week, . defying China's desire to keep the sensitive topic off the agenda. China claims the entire maritime . region, a vital commercial shipping route rich in oil, minerals and . fishery resources. It insists that any disputes be resolved through . bilateral talks and says Washington has no business getting involved. Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, . Malaysia and Brunei hold rivals claims to at least parts of the sea and . tension occasionally flares up into maritime stand-offs. Obama will make an 'anchor speech' outlining the U.S. vision for the Asia-Pacific to the Australian . parliament on Thursday before a whistle stop in Darwin. He then flies to . the Indonesian island of Bali for the East Asia summit. Sit down: Mr Obama, left, and Mrs Gillard arrive for a meeting in her office at Parliament House in Canberra .",

        "document": "MPs are calling for VAT to be scrapped on flights for children in order to save the average family around £200 on their summer holiday. More than 30 MPs of all parties are backing a motion to stop charging Air Passenger Duty on flights for children who are between the ages of two and 11. They say that families with school-age children already pay a premium for having to travel in the school holidays, and should not have to pay extra punitive taxes. MPs say families with school-age children already pay a premium for having to travel in the school holidays, and should not have to pay extra punitive taxes (posed by models) Travelling in economy class on a long-haul flight to Florida attracts at least £94 in tax per person, so scrapping the tax would save a family with two children nearly £200. For a short-haul flight to Spain, the tax adds £13 to the cost for every passenger. Nearly four out of five British adults (78 per cent) say that an annual family holiday should be part of every child’s life, according to a poll by ComRes out today. And three-quarters of UK adults believe that it is unfair that British families pay a flight tax while families from other countries do not get charged. The poll was commissioned by a campaign group called Scrap the Tax on Family Flights, which has pointed out that the Air Passenger Duty paid by British families is the highest in the world. Only four other European countries levy a similar tax, and UK passengers pay the most, more than double the next highest country, Germany. Even families who are planning a ‘staycation’ can be hit by the tax if they decide to take a domestic flight. Two-thirds of those polled said that children under 12 should be exempt from Air Passenger Duty in the same way that children are exempt from other taxes, such as VAT on clothing and some food. Only four other European countries levy a similar tax, and UK passengers pay the most, more than double the next highest country, Germany (stock image) Dale Keller, a spokesman for the campaign, said: ‘The tax on children’s flights is a strain on family budgets. ‘Given that the tax is levied at the highest rates in the world, this tax surely fails to meet the Government’s own “family test”. ‘Scrapping Air Passenger Duty on children’s flights will help to make an annual holiday more affordable for hard-working and hard-pressed families, at a minimal cost to the Government.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, the sponsor of the Early Day Motion which has been signed by MPs, said: ‘It’s important that hard-working families across the UK have the opportunity to enjoy a family holiday once a year. ‘Scrapping the tax on children’s flights is a great way for the Government to help by making holidays more affordable. I am calling on the Government to scrap the tax on children’s flights and help families enjoy the well-earned break they deserve.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is wrong that a week in the sun comes with such a huge tax bill, as the taxman chases holidaymakers all the way to the departure gate. ‘These taxes are not only too high but hit those on lower incomes the hardest. ‘Stealth taxes are unfair and must be abolished. It is time for the Chancellor to give families a break.’",

Mr Stella likened Ms Davis' return to 'winning the lottery' to which she replied 'love you so much' and 'Makes each time we spend together so much more special'. A video montage of pictures of the pair was also uploaded by Mr Stella, alongside a caption which read in part 'endless smile on my face ... #tearsofhappiness'. Other images show the 22-year-old beaming while swimming in the sea, showing off her cropped blonde hair in a bright neon bikini. The 22-year-old has been showing off her cropped blonde hairstyle, one which was forced on her while she was behind bars at Guangzhou Detention Centre . Seen here in an old photograph, her father Larry, a former policeman, opened up about his daughter's traumatic ordeal after her release . Mr Gardner, who Ms Davis met on dating app Tinder, remains imprisoned in China but has had no charges laid against him . Friends of the young woman from Glenmore Park have taken to her page to say hello, wish her a happy new year,  or express their relief that she is safe and sound and moving forward with her life after the ordeal. She has also since returned to her job as an employee of Cover-More Insurance, Fairfax reported. Ms Davis and Mr Gardner met overseas on dating app Tinder late last year, before deciding to take a last minute-trip to China. A New Zealand citizen, Mr Gardner has lived in Australia for some time, having completed his apprenticeship at a western Sydney construction firm. He could still face the death penalty by firing squad for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine. Just following his daughter's release, Ms Davis' father Larry gave a heartfelt interview to The Western Weekender, describing the anguish he went through while she was away. Ms Davis has returned to her job at an insurance company according to reports . 'I don’t know what I have been feeling. It is like I have been brain-dead. Think of a parent’s worst nightmare and multiply it by ten,' he told the publication. 'Her and I are close, as close as any father and daughter could be. I never once thought that she had done anything wrong.' ‘I knew she was so innocent. I prayed every night that the truth would come out… We found out that she was being released on Friday (December 5) night. ‘We cried and cried and cried and cried and I don’t think I had more than four hours sleep after that until last night, when she was home safely,’ he added to the newspaper. Ms Davis' friend Dan Stella had previously posted about the Sydney woman's return, writing he was thankful she was home with loved ones . The relatives of Kalynda Davis (pictured) arrived at her house in Glenmore Park in western Sydney after her release from the Chinese prison . The same week Kaylnda's parents - father Larry and mother Jennifer - told reporters they were pleased and relieved Kalynda was free and safe following her month-long ordeal in Guangzhou. In a statement, they said: 'We are happy to have Kalynda back home. We have always known Kalynda to be innocent of these allegations.' 'Her return home today is a clear statement of her innocence.' 'We have received so much support from family and friends. We thank everyone for the support we have received during the last month.'",

        "document": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- One of Francis Williams' favorite stories to tell is about the time he was pulled over for speeding. As countries and companies plan to go to the moon, a debate heats up on lunar property rights. Williams, who had been in London on business, was driving home through the English countryside when a police officer stopped him and wanted to know two things: Was Williams aware of how fast he was driving? And, what was his profession? It turned out the response to the second question would help Williams resolve the first: \"I said, 'I sell land on the moon,'\" said Williams. \"And [the police officer] said, 'Do you know, my wife has bought some of that.'\" The answer to the first question was subsequently forgotten. Williams, who describes himself as the \"Lunar Ambassador to the United Kingdom,\" is the owner of MoonEstates. He claims to have sold around 300,000 acres of moon land since he and his wife, Sue, founded the Cornwall-based company eight years ago. One-acre plots of lunar turf go for about $40. As proof of purchase, new property owners receive a silver tin containing a personalized \"Lunar Deed\" and a moon map with a tiny black X marking their tract's approximate location. Most of the land Williams sells is in the northwest, in an area known as Oceanus Procellarum, or Ocean of Storms -- a desolate lava plain formed by volcanoes billions of years ago. \"I know the Japanese are [selling] further east,\" he said. Williams received his license to sell lunar land in the UK from Dennis Hope. In 1980, the Nevada-based entrepreneur claimed ownership of the moon after finding what he calls a loophole in the 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty, which forbids countries from owning the moon but, according to Hope, does not forbid individuals from owning it. Hope, who estimates he has sold over 500 million acres of moon land, said he immediately filed a \"declaration of ownership\" with the U.N. along with the United States and Russian governments. After 28 years, the moon mogul still has not received a reply. \"I have never heard from them on that note ever,\" Hope told CNN in a phone interview. While the U.N. may have ignored Hope's lunar land claims for almost three decades, it is unlikely the organization will be able ignore what could soon become a question of increasing international importance: Who, exactly, does own the moon? \"At some point the world community needs to come together and draft some new convention or treaty,\" said Paul Dempsey, director of the Institute of Air and Space Law and McGill University in Montreal. \"It is an open wound that needs to be healed.\" Dempsey pointed out that at the time the U.N. drafted the Outer Space Treaty, there were only two spacefaring nations -- the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Now there are over a dozen. And many of them, including China, Russia, the U.S., India and Japan, want to go to the moon. NASA, for example, recently announced plans to return by 2020, eventually building a permanent base on the lunar surface. The Russian space agency, Roskosmos, has confirmed similar intentions. The burgeoning commercial space sector is also casting its gaze towards Earth's only natural satellite with companies considering everything from mining the lunar surface to building extraterrestrial resorts on it. \"It is quite a complicated issue because it is international law we are dealing with,\" said Niklas Hedman, chief of the Committee Services and Research Section of the U.N.'s Office for Outer Space Affairs in Vienna. There are five treaties that govern international affairs in space, said Hedman.  Two of them -- the Outerspace Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement -- deal with lunar law. The Outer Space Treaty provides a legal framework for the international use of space for peaceful purposes, including the moon and other celestial bodies.  Widely considered the \"Magna Carta of space law,\" this treaty lays down the fundamental principle of non-appropriation and that the exploration and use of space shall be the province of all mankind. According to the treaty, states bear international responsibility for national activities in space, including by non-governmental entities.  The Outer Space Treaty says governments cannot claim ownership of the lunar surface and that stations and installations on the moon shall be open to others, said Hedman. The Moon Agreement builds upon the Outer Space Treaty but also says that any natural resources found on the moon are part of \"the common heritage of mankind\" - in other words, they must be shared. While 98 nations, including all the major spacefaring ones, have ratified the Outerspace Treaty, only 13 countries have approved the Moon Agreement -- Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Uruguay and Mexico, to name four. But Hedman said this does not mean the other 179 countries that have not ratified the Moon Agreement are free to make a lunar land rush. \"They are still bound by the fundamental provisions [of the Outer Space Treaty],\" he said, adding that \"when enough states of the world have ratified a treaty, and it becomes binding, then certain fundamental provisions become binding even on states that have not ratified it.\" Henry Hertzfeld, a space analyst at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said he is not so sure the U.N.'s treaties provide an adequate answer to the question of lunar property rights. \"These treaties don't really have any teeth to them in terms of enforcement,\" said Hertzfeld. \"They are agreements on principle.\" Instead of  focusing on who owns the moon, the international community needs find ways to incentivize future business activity on the moon by guaranteeing that rights to land and resources will not be preempted by competing interests, said Hertzfeld. \"Owning property is not the issue, the issue is finding a mechanism for businesses to make a fair return on their investment,\" he said. \"Otherwise there is no point in investing.\" But first, Hertzfeld said, there also needs to be a guarantee that there is something on the moon worth investing in at all. \"My feeling is until we know what is there, we shouldn't mess with it,\" he said. ...........................

        "document": "(CNN) -- Philippine President Benigno Aquino III declared a state of national calamity as the death toll from Typhoon Bopha, the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, continued to climb. At least 540 people have died since the typhoon, known locally as \"Pablo,\" hit Tuesday, the Philippines' emergency management agency said Sunday, while nearly 1,100 are reported injured. Another 827 people have been reported missing, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. Aquino's declaration of a state of national calamity will allow local governments to access funds for rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts in their areas, the official Philippine News Agency said. The declaration will also help national and international aid reach stricken communities, and will mean price controls are imposed on basic goods, the news agency said. The U.S. Defense Department said it will assist in relief operations, with an emphasis on reaching communities isolated by infrastructure damage. Among the worst hit areas was the poor, remote Compostela Valley region on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where thousands of flimsy houses have been ripped to shreds. Scores of people died, many them swept away in flash floods that roared down from the hills. The epicenter of the devastation appears to have been in New Bataan, a town about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Montevista and close to the steep mountains. The flash floods hit it head-on Tuesday, washing away families huddled in their homes and soldiers stationed in a compound in the town. On Friday, Aquino visited the area, as well as Boston, in Davao Oriental, to see the destruction for himself, the PNA said. He ordered government agencies to speed up relief efforts and the reconstruction of roads and bridges to help much needed supplies and assistance reach the affected areas. \"I have Mindanao on my mind, especially the number of people missing. I am hoping these people will be found safe and sound,\" Aquino was quoted as saying ahead of the visit. The president said he was saddened that some families would spend the holidays in evacuation centers because their homes were destroyed. Rescuers struggle to aid Philippines storm victims . Large parts of New Bataan and many of the people who lived there are now buried under mud, fallen trees and rubble, said Arnaldo Arcadio, an emergency response program manager for Catholic Relief Services, a humanitarian group. \"The mood is really gloomy,\" he said Thursday after visiting the town, where 90% to 95% of the houses are believed to have been destroyed or damaged. Residents who evaded death now lack food, shelter and, most of all, drinking water, since the nearest source is 5 kilometers away, according to Arcadio. \"They are just trying to survive,\" he said, noting that the knee-deep mud in many places made it difficult to get around, with several areas of the town completely inaccessible. Bopha raked across Mindanao and several other Philippine islands before moving off into the South China Sea. The powerful typhoon brought savage winds that uprooted entire banana plantations in low-lying areas, and relentless rain that unleashed torrents of rocks and mud down the mountainsides where shanty-dwelling miners dig for gold. Preemptive action was taken in northern Mindanao, expected to feel the full force of the typhoon, but in the end it was the less prepared communities of Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental, further south and east, that bore the brunt. Many people either didn't hear warnings or didn't heed them, expecting the typhoon to hit further north, as usually happens. The disaster has left about a quarter of a million homeless and affected more than 5 million people overall, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said Friday.

A major Liberal Democrat donor has been arrested as part of an investigation into allegations of bribery at Rolls-Royce. Sudhir Choudhrie was held by police with his son Bhanu this week. Since 2004 they have given £1.2million to the Lib Dems as personal donations and from their companies. The Serious Fraud Office is probing claims that Mr Choudrie - who, with his son, strongly denies wrong doing - acted as an intermediary by Rolls-Royce in deals in China and Indonesia. Sudhir Choudhrie (pictured) and his son Bhanu were quizzed at Snow Hill police station before being released on bail without conditions . More than 150 officers from the Serious Fraud Office, the City of London Police and the National Crime Agency swooped on a number of properties in central London. As a result of the dawn raids on Wednesday, the two men were arrested. Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie were quizzed at Snow Hill police station before being released on bail without conditions. The pair deny any wrongdoing and say they are co-operating fully with the authorities. Bhanu Choudhrie is the chief executive of family firm C&C Alpha Group, which runs care homes in the UK. The company has donated around £487,500 to the Lib Dems since 2010, according to official Electoral Commission records. Another firm, Alpha Healthcare Ltd, gave £540,000 to the party from 2004 to 2010. Bhanu Choudrie gave £30,000 as an individual from 2004 to 2008 while Sudhir Choudhrie has given £155,000 since 2006, including £60,000 in a cash donation to the local party of Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes in November last year. Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats have received around £500,000 from the Choudhries' family firm since 2010 . Sudhir Choudhrie was last year expected to be given a seat in the House of Lords, but it did not happen. Allegations of criminal activity in relation to alleged bribes emerged last year from a former employee. In December the SFO said it was launching a criminal investigation. A spokesman for the Choudhries said: ‘The allegations made against Bhanu and Sudhir Choudhrie are strongly denied. Full co-operation is being given to the authorities.’ A Serious Fraud Office spokesman said: ‘In connection with a Serious Fraud Office investigation, we can confirm a number of search warrants have been executed at various properties in London today, Wednesday, 12 February 2014.  Two men were also arrested. ‘Officers from the National Crime Agency and City of London Police assisted with the operation.'

Owners are giving more than 10 million animals high-calorie foods including take-aways, biscuits, chips and even alcohol, according to the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals charity. Around nine out of ten (87 per cent) give pets treats, despite the fact that 91 per cent realise the resulting obesity can reduce their pet's lifespan. Scroll down for video . People's Dispensary for Sick Animals head nurse Helen Darnell with Border overweight Collie Zed . It means that of the UK's estimated 18 million pets some 2.5 million dogs (one in three) and over two million cats (one in four) are currently overweight, the PDSA claimed. The charity said it was due to owners sharing their own unhealthy eating habits with their pets in a 'well-intentioned but misguided attempt to make them happy'. Elaine Pendlebury, PDSA senior veterinary surgeon, said: 'Sadly, seeing morbidly obese pets is now an everyday occurrence in vet practices across the UK; it is one of the biggest welfare concerns facing the nation's pets. 'It's effectively a silent killer leading to long term health issues for pets that can cut their lifespan by up to two years. 'Pet obesity significantly increases the danger of developing major health problems such as diabetes, arthritis and heart disease and can also bring about the onset of these chronic diseases much earlier. 'It's tragic to think that millions of pets are suffering under the strain of carrying too much weight, when it is an entirely preventable condition.' Too many treats: PDSA nurse Rae Andrew with overweight Sproker Oscar . Unhealthy eating habits: Fat Jack Russell Max has had far too many treats . Pepe the overweight cat on a vet's table. In the UK over two million cats (one in four) are currently overweight . Pets in Scotland were the worst affected, with 72 per cent of owners admitting that they give their animals unsuitable junk food, followed by animals in Wales (69 per cent) and the North West (64 per cent) The survey of 2,078 pet owners found that Londoners scored the best, but almost half (48 per cent) continue to over-indulge their dogs, cats and rabbits. To tackle the problem, the charity is today announcing its annual PDSA Pet Fit Club, which has been running for the last eight years.

Dr Philippa Yam, leading animal obesity expert at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, said: 'PDSA's findings are very worrying and demonstrate that diet remains one of the most misunderstood welfare needs for pets. 'Obesity is one of the most pressing health issues affecting companion animals. PDSA's work in this area is hugely successful. 'I am delighted to see that Pet Fit Club is continuing to make a real impact on pet obesity, by raising awareness of the issue and helping to transform the lives of many pets who were heading for an early grave due to the severity of their weight problems. 'PDSA's programme clearly demonstrates that with tailored veterinary support and education, this devastating condition can be reversed.'",

A man jailed for killing three people at a town planning meeting in Pennsylvania is suing for the right to less starchy prison food. Rockne Newell, 60, has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility, alleging he has been subjected to cruel treatment because his special dietary requests have been ignored. His attorneys claim the prison's high-starch meals trigger erratic mood and energy swings, which could endanger Newell's long-term health. They say that he'd be better off with the kosher meals Jewish inmates receive. Apparently Newell's attempts to purchase healthier options have been hindered by commissary spending limits. According to the Scranton Times-Tribune, his lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order for him to be provided with foods not harmful to his welfare. Newell has been held without bail since August 5, 2013, when he was charged with three counts of homicide following a shooting spree at the Ross Township supervisors' meeting that night. Monroe County District Attorney David Christine intends to seek the death penalty for Newell, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. Prosecutors have said the junk dealer was upset over the loss of his debris-strewn property after a lengthy court fight with the township. The township had acted on complaints that he lived in a storage shed, built an illegal culvert and used a bucket outside as a toilet. The township supervisors were about 15 minutes into their public meeting on the first Monday in August when things reportedly went 'terribly awry.'

        "document": "Mark Sanford is living proof that life is full of second chances. The former Republican governor of South Carolina, whose political career was left for dead along the Appalachian Trail after an extramarital affair, asked for, and Tuesday received, political redemption as he won a special election to fill a vacant House seat that he once occupied. \"I want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity,\" Sanford said at his victory celebration after defeating his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. \"I am one imperfect man saved by God's grace.\" 5 things we learned from Sanford's win . And at a news conference minutes later, Sanford added that \"I think we're always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly a degree of political redemption.\" Sanford, who won 54% to 45%, according to an unofficial vote count in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, made reference to his political baggage from his infamous affair. \"If it was just about market-based ideas and limited government, this campaign would have easily won a long time ago. But I had deficiencies that are well chronicled as a candidate and at the end of the day I was carried across the threshold, if you will, by an incredible team of volunteers.\" Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University's wind turbine drive testing facility who was best known nationally as the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, said that, \"The people have spoken and I respect their decision.\" But she added that \"We gave it a heck of fight\" and assured supporters that \"I will continue to fight for the people of South Carolina.\" Sanford won all five counties in the district, including Charleston and Beaufort, home to Hilton Head, where some Democrats hoped that older voters would be turned off by Sanford's scandals and just stay home. In Charleston County, Sanford's home base but the Democrats' best hope as well, he narrowly edged out Colbert Busch. Colbert Busch won absentee ballots, but it wasn't nearly enough to carry her to victory. Sanford: Primary win was 'a big referendum' on comeback effort . \"Turnout was very large for a special election -- roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, who analyzed the vote. \"That seems to have helped Sanford.  Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn't vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway.\" Sanford's oldest son Marshall and his now-fiancÃ©e Maria Belen Chapur were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration. \"She flew a continent to be here last night. Whether I won or lost, she wanted to be here,\" Sanford said Wednesday mornign on CNN's \"Starting Point.\" \"We certainly appreciate her willing to do so, and I think as folks get to know her, I think they're going to love her.\" Sanford was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared from public view for several days. At the time his staff claimed he'd been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an affair. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010. He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity. But he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad. And even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property. Sanford told CNN that he didn't want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He's scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election. Not long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest. And National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford. The two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford's 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. \"When we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,\" she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage. In South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles . And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using \"tax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it's a question of character.\" The DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. \"I used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father's Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,\" said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial. But over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year's midterm elections. Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace . \"I've fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it's about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,\" Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week. Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate. Sanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race. \"What it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?\" he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race. Colbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats. \"No one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina's 1st Congressional District,\" she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State. While Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn't see eye to eye with the president. \"I respectfully disagree with his budget,\" she said, adding that \"we need to vote to repair\" the president's health care law. Even though they didn't support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014. \"Democrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,\" Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement. But national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch's defeat. \"House Republicans' outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,\" Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. \"In this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\" Sanford has a woman problem . The congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation. No Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak still stands.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:57 EST, 28 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 29 September 2013 . Charged: Michael Lander, 40, will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008 . A woman whose husband allegedly convinced her to adopt a 12-year-old . girl he is accused of sexually assaulting blames . herself for the abuse. Former elementary school teacher Michael Lander will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008. Michael's devastated wife Jennifer Lander said the alleged abuse has ruptured her family and that she constantly goes 'back and forth over how naive' she was to 'allow things to happen'. 'I can't imagine what the girl is going through. My intentions were to give the girl a stable family life and the entire thing completely backfired on me,' she told Tampa Bay Times. 'If i could change anything, I would change the amount of hurt, pain and anguish that has gone on in my family. If i could take it away from my children alone, I would take it away in a heartbeat.' The Land O'Lakes, Florida, family's tragic story began in 2008 when Michael began sharing horrific stories about his fifth-grade student at Schrader Elementary with Jennifer. Michael allegedly said the 12-year-old girl's mother was a drug-addicted stripper who had home schooled her. The girl was same age as his stepdaughter - Jennifer's daughter - Autumn Boisvert. Over time, the stories worsened. Michael said the girl's mother was on the brink of abandoning her, and suggested the couple look after the girl. He said it was her only chance and they owed it to her. Even though money was tight - the couple already had two children with a third on the way - Jennifer agreed and the couple signed the temporary custody paperwork in March 2008. The girl shared a room with Autumn, who embraced her. 'We were best friends, seriously,' Autumn, now 19, said. 'I kind of showed her how not to be so grown up. She wore lots of makeup...skimpy clothes.' Devastated: Jennifer Lander claims her husband Michael was controlling. 'I've gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' she said . Tragic: Jennifer Lander, pictured hugging her son, claims she found thigh-high stockings in her husband's bag after he returned from a trip with the girl. She called police but Michael said the girl wore the stockings because she was a cutter . However, life deteriorated for Jennifer. The principal at Michael's school filed a letter of reprimand on March 10 detailing concerns about Michael's behavior toward the girl. Even before the couple had taken in the . girl, the principal had claimed she 'seemed unusually enamored' with Michael. Staff members also allegedly saw her run her finger down his arm and whisper in his ear. Michael resigned four days later, telling Jennifer he quit . because a vindictive assistant principal wanted him fired. Soon after, Michael planned a trip to South Carolina to search for a new teaching job and said he would take Autumn and the girl. Autumn pulled out at the last minute. When Michael and the girl returned from the trip, Jennifer allegedly discovered thigh high stockings in his bag and called police. Police left after Michael allegedly convinced them and his wife the girl wore stockings to cover self-inflicted cuts. Jennifer believed him. Early days: Michael and Jennifer Lander met in their early 20s, and Michael embraced his new love's five-month-old daughter, Autumn . In May, Jennifer found 'barely legal' porn on Michael's computer and, in a rage, smashed a lasagne tray on the floor. The girl told her mother about the outburst, who then moved her back home. That's when Michael allegedly confided in Autumn, then 13, about his illegal behavior. 'My dad asked me if we could talk about something serious and he brings me into my room, he sits on the corner of my bed, and I just kind of stand in the doorway. And he said, 'Do you think it's OK for two people to love each other despite age?' Autumn said. The situation worsened over time - but Jennifer claimed she was under Michael's spell and believed his many lies. Tampa Bay Times  reported Jennifer intercepted a phone call between Michael, who had picked up tutoring work, and the girl. She claimed she heard her husband tell the girl they needed to 'get some tutoring done'. The girl said: 'Yeah, then we can play.' When Jennifer interrupted, asking what they would play, the startled girl responded: 'Like, Monopoly'. Jennifer ripped the phone out of the wall, and Michael accused her of overreacting. She agreed she was. 'I want people to understand that there's more than one victim. I've  gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' Jennifer said. 'But it's amazing how much control a person can have over your emotions and thoughts and feelings. For some reason, it feels like he has my soul. 'That doesn't mean I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but he has a part of me that I can't get back. I live in such a nice community, and I live in such a pretty house with really pretty things inside.' Jennifer said Michael's attitude slowly improved when their son was born. Heartbroken: Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims her stepfather has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison . Confidante: Autumn said she was just 13 when her stepfather told her about his 'relationship' with his young student who was living with them . But on the day of his son's birth, Michael allegedly picked up the girl and took her home to watch movies with his children. The next morning, Autumn allegedly saw the girl come out of her stepdad's bedroom, according to Tampa Bay Times. 'She told me she wants me to be her first,' Autumn recalled her stepdad telling her. 'I told her no.' Just a few weeks later, the girl's mother called Jennifer saying she'd found sexually explicit emails. When Jennifer confronted Michael, he fell to his knees saying it was blackmail and the girl's mother wanted money. Jennifer said Michael convinced her that the girl might have put something incriminating on his computer. They smashed it to pieces, and spent the night driving around town, throwing the broken bits out of the window. As months passed, Jennifer became increasingly suspicious of her husband. She confronted Michael on New Year's Eve 2008 - he said the girl had grabbed his crotch once in their kitchen, and it 'partially aroused' him. It made Jennifer vomit. However she stood by her man. But their lives turn another horrible turn. Hurting: Jennifer Lander has filed divorce from her husband but says he has a piece of her soul . Broke, the couple started stealing and selling appliances to make money after Michael quit teaching. The thefts continued until 2010 when they were caught by Hernando deputies. Michael, now 40, took a seven-year plea to protect his wife. She got probation. That's when Autumn revealed her stepfather's disturbing history. The girl went to police. Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims Michael has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison. One said: 'Autumn, sometimes we think we know more than we do. Sometimes we voice what we think we know, but don't. Sometimes we're toughest on those we love most,' he wrote. 'Sometimes we regret what we might say or what actions we take. Sometimes we are lucky. Always we miss those that we love when we are not in their company. Always do we try to protect our children from dangers seen or ever imagined.' Jennifer has filed for divorce but has not yet had him served. Michael's trial begins on October 1. He is charged with four sex crimes and could spend life behind bars.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- The prospect of a winter World Cup in 2022 looks set to become a reality after Europe's football associations voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer. All 54 member associations of UEFA, Europe's governing body, backed the decision at the meeting in Croatia Thursday. \"They all agreed that this competition could not take place in the heat of Qatar in the summer,\" FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce told CNN. \"At the end of the day common sense has to prevail here and I'm glad at long last common sense has prevailed,\" he added. FIFA, the game's world governing body, has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans would be adversely affected by the searing heat, which can reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer. FIFA President Sepp Blatter recently stated that it would not be feasible to hold a summer World Cup in Qatar and will make a decision on the timing of the tournament at the Executive Committee meeting in Zurich, Switzerland on October 3 and 4. A winter World Cup would cause chaos with the European domestic season with clubs fearing they could lose out financially. \"What has to happen now is that the people who are involved, including the people from Qatar, they have to sit down and work out a situation that's going to cause (as) minimum (a) disruption that can possibly be made to football,\" said Boyce. \"Not only in Europe but throughout the world. \"There are nine years to plan the World Cup and surely with common sense this can be overcome.\" UEFA President Michel Platini, who voted for Qatar, believes a move to January or February would suit his members. \"I was very happy to learn that FIFA president Joseph Blatter wants to move the 2022 World Cup to the winter, something I've long advocated,\" the Frenchman told the media last month. Platini also rejected claims by the chief executive of the English Premier League, Richard Scudamore, who claimed switching the World Cup was \"well nigh impossible,\" citing disruption to the calendar and the impact on lucrative television deals. He added: \"For 150 years, England has imposed its calendar and we've respected it. \"So for once, for one month, England could respect another calendar.\" FIFA's decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has led to huge criticism with Australian football chiefs threatening legal action. Australia, which lost out to Qatar along with South Korea, the U.S. and Japan, believes it should be compensated if the World Cup is held in the winter rather than the summer. Earlier this week, the Football Federation of Australia laid out its case which it expects FIFA's Executive Committee to examine. \"An in-principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions, and national prestige, in bidding for a summer event,\" it said. \"If there is consensus within the Ex-Co that a change in date should be considered, then a transparent process should be established to examine the scheduling implications for all leagues and a method developed for agreeing appropriate compensation for those affected.\" That case is unlikely to succeed according to a FIFA spokesperson, despite the pressure from the Australian FA. A FIFA spokesperson told CNN: \"As part of the bidding documents all bidders, including the FA Australia, accepted that the final decision regarding the format and dates of the staging of the FIFA World Cup and FIFA though initially expected to be in June/July, remains subject to the final decision of the FIFA Organizing Committee. \"There is no ground for any speculations.\"",

On Wednesday, the curtains went up on Cuba's first Broadway musical since 1959, and the actors were celebrating much more than the show's debut. Scroll down for video . Reaching out: On Wednesday, the curtains went up on RENT, Cuba's first Broadway musical since 1959, and the actors were celebrating much more than the show's debut . Anticipation: After applying to put on the Spanish-language version of RENT, it took producers a year to get a response from Cuba . Wild times: The debut of RENT in Havana came just after the surprise announcement by President Obama to normalize relations with the small Caribbean nation . In front of an invitation-only crowd of dignitaries and theater aficionados, a cast of 15 put up the Spanish translation of the hit 90s musical RENT that they had been practicing for the past month. 'We rocked the roof off the theater,' the musical's Cuban-American director Andy Señor Jr told the Miami Herald. It was a production years in the making, with revered producer Bob Nederlander Jr at the helm and Mr Señor Jr, an original cast member, directing. Even after applying to stage the show last fall, it took a year to get a response, Mr Nederlander Jr told DailyMail.com. 'That year was tense,' he said. 'We did have to wait a while and there were times I wasn't sure what would happen. I had this false sense of optimism but they could have said anything.' During the wait, they never imagined the scenes of Wednesday December 17, when the US and Cuba agreed to normalize relations. 'It was a brilliant moment on Wednesday, the announcement was a real, real surprise. Open wounds: The themes explored in RENT about sexuality, poverty, the struggle with AIDS and addictions were still raw in the country . Success: RENT, a modern adaptation of Puccini's La Boheme, replaces 1800s Paris with 1990s New York City, and tuberculosis with AIDS.The original production enjoyed a seven-year run. 'All of the cast and crew were huddled around the television watching their president's speech. 'They are all incredibly happy, incredibly excited. 'The timing really is astounding. We have a front-row seat to see this history unfold. It is incredible.' RENT, a modern adaptation of Puccini's La Boheme, replaces 1800s Paris with 1990s New York City, and tuberculosis with AIDS. The original production enjoyed a seven-year run. Excitement: The producers spoke about the emotion of putting this show on for young Cubans, as the themes and music, they hoped, would connect with the current generation . Dealing: The musical deals heavily with the issue of HIV and AIDS, while the island nation's healthcare system developed to fight the disease has been lauded internationally . Audiences across the US and Europe embraced the struggling film maker, the nightclub dancer, the drag queen; the bisexuality, the drugs, the fight against AIDS. Despite the cultural references - which may fly over the heads of 95 per cent of Cubans who don't have internet - Nederlander insists this is the perfect musical to break the ice. And the directors of Havana's Bertolt Brecht Theater, chosen for its intimate setting, had no objections. 'It is perfect. We wanted to excite a younger audience, and RENT has everything. The music contemporary, and the themes of friendship, love, loss, hate... They're things we can all connect with; things everyone in Havana will connect with.' In fact, many of the show's issues are still open wounds for the Caribbean nation. Cuba did not legalize homosexuality until 1979. However, the nation's battle with AIDS has been as devastating and testing as New York's. And though critics question the Castro brothers' motives, their healthcare system developed to fight the disease has been lauded internationally. The original run on Broadway accrued a following of fans dubbed 'RENTheads' - New Yorkers similar to the embattled characters, who would queue for hours to get their hands on specially discounted tickets. Those tickets would be reserved for the front two rows of the stalls, and cast members frequently gushed about the atmosphere in those rows, . In Havana, all tickets throughout the three-month run will be sold for the equivalent of 50 cents. And in a meta-theatrical twist, the show opens on Christmas Eve with the characters praying they will make it through Christmas. Señor Jr, who played the AIDS-infected transvestite Angel in the original, gave a hint of that atmosphere from the rehearsal room. 'We're making the impossible possible!' he said.",

Antonio Manfredi, director of the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum in Naples, kicked off the protest this week by setting fire to a painting by French artist Severine Bourguignon. Manfredi says the museum will burn three artworks each week as part of its \"Art War\" campaign. \"I have 1,000 artworks from artists around the world, and they're already facing destruction due to the indifference of the government,\" he told CNN. \"We want the government to pay attention to the country's cultural institutions.\" In the face of mounting debt problems, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has enacted tough austerity measures in an attempt to keep the country from defaulting. Manfredi says those cuts have hit cultural institutions hard, and that a handful of museums in Rome, Palermo and elsewhere have closed in recent months due to lack of funding. The museum is only burning works with the blessing of their artists. Bourguignon watched the burning of her painting via Skype, Manfredi says, and artist Rosaria Matarese from Naples torched her wood sculpture in person at the museum on Wednesday. Other European artists are joining the protest -- Welsh sculptor John Brown burned one of his artworks on YouTube, and Manfredi says other artists will light up their artworks via Skype next week. \"Next week the first one is an artist from Austria,\" he told CNN. \"I hope that the government stops me because this is terrible what I'm doing.\" While Manfredi has never received government funding for his museum, he says he wants the government to come to Naples \"just to see how difficult it is to be a museum here with no money.\" Manfredi says the government has yet to respond to his protest, and says he won't stop until they answer.",

This is the terrifying moment a jeweller was tasered in his home by a raider posing as a delivery man – before his brave fiancee grabbed a kitchen knife and chased off the intruder. The attack on multi-millionaire gold dealer Nigel Blackburn was caught on CCTV at his home in Hemington, Leicestershire. As the 56-year-old went to sign for what he thought was a package, he was shot in the side of his neck with the Taser and pushed to the floor. Scroll down for video .

Speaking outside Leicester Crown Court, Mr Blackburn said: ‘Pranee stopped me from being killed. When . the delivery man suddenly stuck a stun-gun into my neck the pain was . excruciating. I dragged him to the floor with me and started shouting. ‘Pranee . and Mornrat heard me and came downstairs as fast as two horses bolting.

'And I took the ticket from the week before to see if I had won anything - the honest truth is I nearly threw it away - but I took it down with me anyway. 'Gary, who works behind the counter, said 'oh Camelot has said you have to call them'. I thought it was a wind up. 'It's been madness we've had close friends and family in our house celebrating ever since. Its only just sinking in. 'I just couldn't sleep, I was guarding the ticket worried someone may come and pinch it. 'I went to the supermarket and splashed out a tenner on new slippers, I couldn't think of anything else I really needed. 'We are a very close family and exceptionally down to earth people - we won't let this go to our heads. 'I have worked hard my whole life and no intention to retire just because I have won the lottery. 'I have a couple of years left until my retirement, the airport were very good to me 11 years ago when I was unwell and supported me. 'I wouldn't want to leave them in the lurch and I want to do right by them too - I'm a bit of a joker, they still don't quite believe it's true.' Wealthy: Mr Baxter has now vowed to buy his wife the stainless steel kitchen sink she 'has always wanted' Father-of-three sons Mr Baxter didn't realise he was a millionaire winner until he decided to take an evening stroll to his local newsagents on Friday. While purchasing his tickets for the EuroMillions draw, he casually asked the shop keeper to check his ticket from the previous Tuesday. The stunned cashier at Basra's Store in Baldock, Herts., told technical services worker Mr Baxter he needed to call Camelot 'urgently'. He headed home to his wife and made the call to lottery organisers, who confirmed he had netted the seven figure prize. Mr Baxter said he was so stunned by the win he claimed he didn't sleep at all for 24-hours and has only bought himself a pair of slippers. Retired funeral arranger Mrs Baxter said money 'can't buy health or happiness' but they have always been happy with their lot - and will now treat themselves to a holiday. She said: 'We could go and see whales which is something I've always wanted to do - but I think I'm a bit too old now. 'I'm happy with a holiday in Great Yarmouth and we will continue to have day trips and holidays there too. 'It may be a lot of money but it won't change what we like. 'We won't be moving because we have finally got our house just how we want it and it's our home. 'Money doesn't buy happiness and we are very happy just as we are, this is just incredible luck which we hope to share with our family.' Wahey! Mr Baxter won the massive amount on the EuroMillions raffle draw with a winning ticket he admits he nearly threw away . Mr Baxter, originally from Stevenage, met his wife in 1967 in a working men's club and they have now been married 45 years. He said: 'That was in the days of mods and rockers, I was a rocker and she was a mod. I was near the bar and she stood on my toe and didn't apologise. 'We started dating and married a few months later. Our family is our world and we couldn't be luckier.' Despite failing health and triple heart bypass a 11 years ago, Mr Baxter considers himself very lucky. He and his wife plan to make a sizeable donation to The Meningitis Trust of whom they are big supporters. Mr Baxter, who is known by friends as the practical joker, added: 'We nearly lost our granddaughter Kimberley to meningitis when she was very young. 'Now she is 19 and here with us we are more than grateful for the charities support and our world wouldn't be the same with out her. 'We want to help other families but we don't wish disclose how much we plan to give at this point.' The couple today claimed they plan to continue buying their weekly ticket.",

        "document": "The parents of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas for more than five years, left their protest tent outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office Wednesday, thanking their supporters before heading home. \"Our happiness will be filled with concern until Gilad returns,\" his mother Aviva said, a day after Netanyahu said a deal had been made to free him in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. \"It is clear that we won't be getting back the same boy. But the best professional people in Israel will be made available to help us,\" she said after she and her husband Noam met President Shimon Peres. They did not take down the protest tent they erected more than a year ago to draw attention to their son's plight. Shalit is expected to return to Israel within a few days, Netanyahu said Tuesday night, before the Cabinet voted in emergency session 26-3 in support of the swap. All Israelis feel powerful emotions about Shalit, said Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Daniel Taub. \"He really is the child of us all,\" Taub said, noting that almost all Israelis do military service. \"Seeing Gilad coming home ... is really coming home to every family. But at the same time it's very bittersweet,\" he said, since \"every one of us in some way has been touched by terrorism.\" Netanyahu said Tuesday that the government would \"return Gilad healthy and whole to his family and all of Israel.\" \"The negotiations were difficult. ... We had to make difficult decisions but (the) correct one. With all the change taking place in the Middle East we did not know if a better deal or any deal would have been possible.\" Netanyahu said on Twitter that the \"arduous negotiations\" brokered through Egyptian mediators resulted in a deal last Thursday and it was signed formally by Israel and the Palestinians on Tuesday. In a speech broadcast on Hamas-run Al-Quds television, exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said the prisoner exchange will involve the release of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including women. \"The deal will happen in two stages -- the first stage the release of 450 Palestinian prisoners, including 315 Palestinian prisoners that have one or many life sentences and the ones who are with high sentences. The second stage will include 550 Palestinian prisoners,\" he said. Hamas is the militant Palestinian movement that controls Gaza. Of the 450 Palestinian prisoners to be freed during the first stage, 110 will go to the West Bank while 40 will go abroad, according to Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman. The 550 prisoners scheduled to be released during the second stage will be freed two months later, he said. According to Regev, jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti is not among the prisoners Israel has agreed to release. Palestinians captured Shalit in June 2006 after tunneling into the Jewish state and attacking an Israeli army outpost. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him. Since then, he has been held incommunicado by Hamas. In October 2009, Hamas released a tape of Shalit to prove he was still alive in exchange for the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Since then, there has been no proof of life. There have been ongoing attempts to broker a deal to release Shalit, but all had failed.",

An inventive photographer managed to snap a series of spectacular images of historic Cambridge from the air by strapping a camera - to a kite. Bill Blake, 52, had always taken photos in his role as a surveyor and tried to think of a way to take aerial pictures without spending a fortune. After a brain wave he went out and bought a lightweight camera and stunt kite, then rigged up his own eye in the sky. New heights: Bill Blake, 52, uses a large three square metre kite attached to him by a harness with a camera strapped to the line to take the stunning aerial photographs . Bleak: The frozen Cambridgshire fenns take on an entirely different appearance from high in the sky aboard Bill Blake's kite . Bird's eye view: The innovative set up of flying his camera high above Landguard fort at Felixstowe on a kite, enabled Bill Blake to take stunning pictures . Heavens above: The kite and camera combinations has enabled Bill to take pictures from unusual perspectives - including this one of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge . Bill said he had been delighted with the snaps he has managed to take thanks to rekindling his boyhood love of kite-flying. He said: ‘I have been a keen kite flyer since I was a lad. As soon as I realised I could combine it with photography I found a new interest in kite flying.’ Surprised by the quality of his results, Bill started taking more pictures in his spare time and has now turned his creative idea into a regular hobby. Among the beautiful images he has been able to capture are shots of the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge. He uses a large three square metre kite attached to him by a harness with a camera fastened to the line taking the stunning aerial photographs. His mini light weight Leica X1 camera is controlled via a radio on the ground. Eye in the sky: Bill Blake has now been able to photograph Cambridge from hundreds of feet up without spending a fortune on a plane or helicopter ride . A different perspective: Bill uses a mini light weight Leica X1 camera, which he controls via a radio from the ground to snap a boat yard . Soaring views: Bill Blake's portfolio of beautiful pictures taken using the kite includes this Baconsthorpe castle in Norfolk . The father-of-two, who lives with his wife Anne, 33, in Cambridge, said: ‘The process is a simple idea. Photographers used balloons and kites to raise cameras before aircrafts were invented. ‘The camera has to be light so it does not get blown about too much. I can walk left and right, but I cannot completely control the camera position from the ground. ‘I need a lot of open space to take the images - that is why windmills are some of my favourite buildings to capture. ‘I have revisited my childhood love of kites. There was a huge craze for kites in the 1970s. ‘Maybe it is something of a middle aged man thing. ‘I started four years ago and have been inspired by other kite photographers. I decided this year that I wanted to get these pictures seen.’ Bill will go on show at All Saints Church, Cambridge, for a week from Saturday. Innovation: This picture of a Martello Tower at Felixstowe was the product of Bill combining his childhood love of flying kites with his passion for photography . Rigging: Photographer took spectacular images of historic Britain with a mini light weight Leica X1 camera, strapped to a kits, which he controls via a radio from the ground . Exhibition: Bill's collection of photos taken by rigging a camera to a kite, will go on show at All Saints Church, Cambridge, for a week from Saturday .",

Anderson allegedly shot 39-year-old Angel Rojas, a father of two who supported his wife and kids by working two jobs, one at a bodega and another at a fruit stand. Rojas was on the B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn, where Anderson and two girls were sitting in the back row. Married father-of-two Angel Rojas, 39, was declared dead at a Brooklyn hospital after he was shot by a 14-year-old boy following a disagreement on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Thursday evening . When the bus picked people up at . Lafayette Avenue and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, the two girls yelled 'he's . on the bus' as Anderson's intended target, a rival gangster from the . Twan Family gang, boarded the bus. Anderson . then emerged from the back of the bus with a 'weapon he could barely . control' and started shooting, according to the New York Daily News. Anderson . missed his target, but hit Rojas in the back of the head as he stood in . the front of the bus talking on his cell phone. After . missing his target - but fatally wounding Rojas - Anderson chased his . rival gangsters off the bus, firing four more shots from his massive . .357 Magnum pistol before running off and briefly hiding out in a . laundromat. 'Pretty big gun for a pretty small man,' a disgusted New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told the News. 'The . stupidity of those gangs that . basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other,' Bratton . continued to fume. 'Unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as . they did with this . hardworking young man trying to raise his family.' The victim was shot in the head following a dispute involving several teenagers on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on Thursday evening . Rojas, of East Flatbush, was rushed . to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died a short time later, the police . and emergency workers said. Originally from the Dominican . Republic, Rojas had moved to the U.S. about four years ago with his wife, . Maria Lopez, 41, their son, Saury, 12, and daughter, April, 8. In between his two jobs, Rojas would take the bus home in between . shifts to hug his children and get something to eat, according to his . family. 'That was very bad . of him,' son Saury said of his father's killer. 'He’s too small to be . with a gun. If he didn’t have that gun, my dad would be alive now.' The . family that once relied on Rojas' hard work is now left without a . provider, which has caused worry on top of the heartache for his . grieving wife. '[He was] the best man in the world . because his family always came first,' his wife, Maria Lopez, told DNAInfo. 'I . want [Anderson] to be punished even though he's not an adult, so he can . reflect and stop killing innocent people,' she continued. Rojas' children will remember him as a loving father who worked hard to make sure their needs were met. 'He took us to Coney Island,' his . son, Saury, told the website. 'We would go on rides every summer.' This . isn't the Anderson's first scrape with the law - he was arrested in . 2011 for assault, a police spokesman said. He was just 11 at the time of . that crime. Anderson will be charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal use of a firearm, the NYPD said. He likely will be charged as an adult.",

According to Sacramento Sheriff’s Department spokesman Jason Ramos there are some similarities between the descriptions of the suspects from both incidents but the vehicle descriptions are different.",

        "document": "The coffin of the 'tallest man in the world' was carried to the graveyard on the back of an open truck because his remains were too large for a hearse. Leonid Stadnyk, who died this week aged 44, is believed to have been 8ft 5in tall but he refused to be measured by Guinness World Records officials, regarding such a request as 'humiliating'. The peasant farmer, who suddenly started growing at the age of 12 after a botched brain operation, saw his height as a 'curse', rather than good fortune. Scroll down for video . Leonid Stadnyk, the unofficial tallest man in the world, was carried to his grave on the back of an open truck . The 8ft 5in giant held a candle as an Orthodox priest, who called him a 'giant in every sense', stood over him . A gentle giant: Mr Stadnyk, from Ukraine, had a huge growth spurt at the age of 12 after a bungled operation . Transport had always been an issue for the gentle giant, who said that 'being in a bus for me is like a normal person being driven in the boot of a car - torture'. And the same problems followed him in death, as his coffin had to be driven to the cemetery on an open truck because it did not fit into the converted minibuses normally used as hearses in Ukraine. At his funeral, conducted by an Orthodox priest in his native Zhitomyr region, he was called 'a giant in every sense'. As mourners bade their final farewell, his head lay on a drape in the colours of Ukraine, yellow and blue, his hand clasping a candle. A hero in his own war-ravaged country, once called the 'Pride of Ukraine', he was found dead on Sunday - Independence Day - from a cerebral haemorrhage following health problems. Despite the fortune he could have made by taking advantage of his size, the gentle giant always refused to be measured for record books, not wishing to be seen as a performing Goliath. Colossus: Mr Stadnyk suffered severe health problems throughout his life and died of a brain haemorrhage . Big friendly giant: The Ukrainian peasant farmer's hands (top) were more than a foot in diameter . Meanwhile his feet were a massive UK size 27, making them 18in in length. Mr Stadnyk had to give up his career as a vet as he could not find shoes in his size that could withstand freezing temperatures . Humble: The 8ft 5in man was bigger than other 'tallest men', but refused to be measured by records officials . Mr Stadnyk said he did not want to be seen as a circus freak and had no desire to be in 'this Guinness book' 'I have more important things to do getting through the survival course that is our life in Ukraine,' he once said. A peasant farmer in the Ukrainian village of Podoliantsy, Mr Stadnyk was a modest man who admitted to problems in his love life caused by his colossal frame. 'I don't want or need the fame that this would bring so I have no desire to be in this Guinness book,' he said, shaking his large head in his home, where he had to constantly stoop to avoid bumping his head on the ceiling. 'To me, my height is a curse, a punishment from God, not something to celebrate. 'What sin I have committed, I do not know. All my life I have dreamed of being just like everyone else.' Unable to independently verify his measurements, Guinness instead officially listed Bao Xishun as the world's tallest man despite being about inches shorter than the Ukrainian. A Guinness World Records spokeswoman once said: 'We have contacted Stadnyk, but he seems like a very shy guy. 'He doesn't want us around. So we have to stick to what we have.' Watch your head: The modest farmer had to stoop in most parts of his humble home in the town of Podoliantsy . While Mr Stadnyk was popular and had many friends, he saw his height as a 'curse' and lived an unhappy life . He never married and did not commit to any women as he did not want to burden them with his health problems . Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive . 'This life is for smaller people': The gentle giant, who was loved by neighbours, was never happy with his life . Mr Stadnyk said that while he was unofficially the tallest man, he still felt like 'one of the most helpless' Ironically at school in the then USSR, the gentle giant was almost the smallest boy in his class, and was nicknamed 'Titch'. Surgeons bungled an operation on a benign brain tumour when Mr Stadnyk was 12, cranking his pituitary gland, responsible for generating the hormones stimulating growth, into overdrive. At one point his giganticism left him growing at the rate of roughly a foot every three years. He wore size 27 shoes for feet that measured almost 18 inches in length. His gargantuan palms were more than a foot in diameter. Talking about life, he explained how his height prevented him following his desired career. 'I was trained as a vet and loved my work,' he said. 'But gradually I found that I couldn't get the shoes I needed in winter to protect me from the frostbite. I just couldn't keep on with this work. 'I know I'm the tallest man but at the same time I often feel one of the most helpless. This life is for smaller people.' 'My helplessness makes me angry. I don't like to be mocked.' Ironically, Mr Stadnyk (centre left) was called 'Titch' at school because he was one of the shortest in his class . As a youngster, Mr Stadnyk aspired to be a vet but had to quit because of issues related to his sheer size . Leonid Stadnyk, the 'tallest man in the world', died this week aged 44 from a cerebral haemorrhage . At home he slept on two double beds, pushed together, but had no woman to join him because he was scared to make his problems someone else's burden. He said: 'I don't want to inflict my problems on a wife. I think it would not be fair on her.' Mr Stadnyk died a bachelor. He said his dearest wish was to climb down from the tower that imprisoned him, adding: 'I know it can never happen.' His neighbours knew him as a kind a generous man, always ready to help. One, Bronyslave, said he was 'the most unselfish, diligent man, of a pure soul.' Though not in the Guinness World Records for his height, he was perhaps bigger in other ways than many whose names are included there.",

        "document": "Hong Kong student protest leaders Joshua Wong and Lester Shum were among those arrested amid heated confrontations as authorities attempted to clear demonstration camps in the Mong Kok district for a second day. Wong, the 18-year old founder of the secondary school activist group Scholarism, and Shum, deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, were arrested after police and bailiffs moved to clear barricades on Nathan Road in the bustling commercial area, a spokeswoman for the student federation told CNN. By midday Wednesday, authorities had cleared barricades and tents from the long-established protest camp. Prior to his arrest, Shum told CNN he urged protesters to remain on the streets until the \"last second.\" \"We will still conduct our civil disobedience action until the last second, until the plaintiffs or the police arrest us,\" he said. Bailiffs have been engaged to clear the Mong Kok protest camps in accordance with a court order obtained by local business interests, following complaints that the protests have disrupted life in parts of the city for nearly two months. Police warned that anyone obstructing the bailiffs in their work would face charges of contempt of court or obstructing an officer. Some protesters were seen assisting authorities in dismantling shelters, as police ordered demonstrators disperse and not to interrupt the clearance. Others were tackled to the ground and detained by police during the clearance efforts. Night of clashes . The police action followed a night of heated clashes between police and protesters, after authorities attempted to clear another road in Mong Kok, Argyle Street, Tuesday. As of 6am Wednesday morning Hong Kong time, 116 people had been arrested during the confrontation in Mong Kok, according to Alice Tam of the Police Public Relations Branch. Offenses included resisting police, illegal assembly, possession of weapons and attacking police. Twenty police officers were injured in clashes, said Tam. Lawmaker and pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok-hung, commonly known as \"Long Hair,\" was among those arrested, his office confirmed. Tuesday's clearance effort began peacefully, with some protesters indicating their intention to relocate to other protest camps peacefully. But events spiraled into violence as crowd numbers swelled, with police dressed in riot gear spraying liquid referred to by local media as \"tear water\" toward the crowd to drive them back. Police warned protesters to retreat, displaying banners that read: \"Stop charging, or we use force.\" As the situation Tuesday night escalated, activists issued calls on social media for reinforcements. The Hong Kong Federation of Students' tweeted: \"More support urgently needed in Mong Kok! Bring helmets, (goggles), shields, umbrellas, towels and be careful!\" As bailiffs announced their intention to clear the site Tuesday morning, protesters joined in chants calling for universal suffrage and demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive, C.Y. Leung. Prior to leaving on a trip to South Korea on Tuesday, Leung said he had confidence in police to handle the situation in Mong Kok and said the government remained willing to engage in dialogue on political reform. Universal suffrage . Pro-democracy protesters have occupied camps in parts of the city for nearly two months, and maintain a main protest site outside government buildings in Admiralty on Hong Kong Island. Calling for universal suffrage, they want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress has said they'll be able to vote only for candidates from a short list approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially appointed 1,200-member election committee. At the peak of the protests in early October, tens of thousands of people were on the streets at three locations. But numbers have dwindled as the protests have continued, and recent local polling suggests support has dipped. In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the protests should continue. No plans to halt . Prior to his arrest, Shum told CNN there were no plans to give up the protests. \"The most urgent step is to revoke the August 31 NPC decision. The political reform problem starts from there,\" he said, referring to the Chinese central government's controversial decision to impose vetting restrictions on who could run as a candidate for Hong Kong's top office. \"If the Chinese communist party refuses to, or the Hong Kong government does not reflect how Hong Kong people think, we urge them to deny the political reform bill in the Legislative Council and restart the whole political process again.\" He said the decision on whether to remain on the streets and face violence or arrest was each individual protester's own to make. \"I believe it is a personal or individual decision, because everyone has different degrees of consequences that they have to face alone,\" he said. Who's who in the Hong Kong protests?",

Cleared: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston was cleared of the accusations he faced at a student code of conduct hearing involving an alleged sexual assault two years ago . 'We will consider an appeal but right now we feel a little duped,' said Baine Kerr, one of the woman's lawyers. 'At some point we have to recognize that Florida State is never going to hold James Winston responsible.' AP is not identifying the woman because it does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse. Kerr said in the emailed statement that between his client, Winston, and two teammates that were at the off-campus apartment - Chris Casher and Ronald Darby - only the woman would answer questions about what happened. 'Somehow Jameis Winston still wins,' Kerr said. 'The order doesn't even follow the Student Conduct Code and it ignores the bulk of the evidence.' Florida State president John Thrasher said in a statement that the university selected the former state Supreme Court justice to remove any doubt about the integrity of the process. 'He (Harding) conducted a thorough Student Conduct Code hearing and reviewed more than 1,000 pages of evidence generated by three other investigations, and we would like to thank him sincerely for his service,' Thrasher said. Harding wrote that both sides' version of the events had strengths and weaknesses, but he did not find the credibility of one 'substantially stronger than the other.'

Ruling: This month, a two-day hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment . 'In sum, the preponderance of the evidence has not shown that you are responsible for any of the charged violations of the Code,' Harding wrote. Winston family adviser David Cornwell did not respond to requests for comment. Cornwell has contended that attorneys for the former student pushed for the hearing after they were rebuffed in an attempt to reach a settlement with Winston. Florida State faces Oregon in the College Football Playoffs semifinal on January 1. Before the ruling, there were questions whether Winston would be available to play. The Seminoles won a national championship with Winston at the helm last season and have not lost a game since he earned the starting job before the beginning of the 2013 season. Florida State is currently being investigated by the Department of Education on how hit handles possible Title IX violations. The woman who said Winston assaulted her filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, which decided the university should be investigated for possible Title IX violations over the way it responds to sexual violence complaints. Title IX is a federal statute that bans discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. The Department of Education in 2011 warned schools of their legal responsibilities to immediately investigate allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence, even if the criminal investigation has not concluded.",

As well as being a pleasure to chat to at the crack of dawn on a Saturday morning, Jasper really understands the female form and knows exactly how to show it off in all its glory. 'That is my thing, you know, creating flattering clothes,' he tells me backstage ahead of the show. Scroll down for video . Jasper Conran's collection of autumnal shades presented an extremely wearable line . He achieved it last season via sexy slips, double faced cashmere and covetable coats so how will he be dressing us for SS15? 'Its a combination of body conscious and much easier and softer shapes,' he said of his fluid jerseys and light weight silk shirt dresses punctuated with painterly abstracts in navy and coffee. And while we are more accustomed to Jasper's play-it-safe style, the designer has pulled out his paintbrush and experimented with a more artistic vibe this season. At London Fashion Week we are a accustomed to extrovert design so it comes as a breath of fresh air to see a pared down collection . Jasper says that the collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose and wearable approach . Unlike many designers who have raised their hems for SS15 Jasper has gone for a longer length . 'The collection is inspired by artists but fused with a much more loose, easy and wearable approach. It's sporty, summery and fresh,' he said. Pigment blue was projected across a palette of mostly white, and grids, stripes and spheres emblazoned skinny knit tops and skirts. Unlike a lot of designers, who have raised their hems for SS15, Jasper's conservative silhouettes fell below the knee and footwear was exclusively espadrilles in rusty brown, navy and chalk white. 'This collection is a departure for me; it's a softening up.' And quite a departure it was at Somerset House today; one women will welcome with open arms come spring.

        "document": "By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 10:08 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 18 October 2013 . Many comedians and TV personalities such as Alan Partridge and Johnathon Ross have their own bands to add a bit of interest to their shows. And now for the first time a fashion brand has introduced an in house musical offering as ASOS launched it's own band. Over the next two months visitors to the fashion site will be able to hear new ASOS House Band duo 'Man Like Me' ... and one of their muses the Made In Chelsea star Millie Manderson (nee Mackintosh) will even be staring in one of the videos. Scroll down for video . Millie attended the launch party for the ASOS House Band on Thursday night, pictured right with her model friend Charlotte de Carle . The new ASOS house band 'Man like me' posed at the launch party last night with TV presenter and host for the night Arielle Free . Hundreds of artists were auditioned for the band slot until ASOS found the perfect duo, Johnny Langer and Peter Duffy (pictured here with their backing singer) The first release from the House Band will be 'LOLROFLOMFGLMFAO', which asks 'who needs words when you've got letters?' Last night ASOS launched its new House Band, which saw Millie Mackintosh attend the exclusive VIP party at ASOS HQ. Millie attended with her friend Charlotte de Carle. The pair chatted together, dressed to impressed in printed suits and matching bangs. Tweeting throughout the evening in the ASOS fashion house, the pair #twins at each other, with Millie overheard telling pals that with MIC back on air she is missing the show and hoped for a comeback. Also in attendance was trendy TV presenter Arielle Free and Big Brother presenter AJ Odudu. Over the coming weeks the house band will be debuting a series of ditties that take a sideways look at things like the joys of a fashion face-off (‘Frock Off’), celebrity worship (‘Me, My Girl and Ryan (Gosling)’) and finding loose change down the back of the couch (‘Found A Pound’). One of the music videos, ‘Supersonic’, features Millie and her transition from 'West London It Girl to edgy East London' (their words, not ours). That song, which celebrates her sense of style and London’s love of partying, will be released on the ASOS website 22nd November featuring a guest appearance from the lady herself. The house band is the latest clever online marketing strategy used by the fashion brand who were one of the first to introduce a digital magazine . Other House Band inspirations include . the perils of buying suitable Christmas presents (‘Wrap It Up’) and the . nation’s growing obsession with posting photos of their pets across . social networks (‘Heavy Petting’). Hundreds . of artists were auditioned for the band until ASOS found their perfect . fit, Johnny Langer and Peter Duffy (also known as Man Like Me). One of the music videos, 'Supersonic', features former Made In Chelsea star Millie Manderson . The fashion website hope that the charming pair will win the hearts, ears, and pursestrings of ASOS shoppers. The pair will often be joined by Talia, a female backing singer, in their videos. The first release from the House Band is be ‘LOLROFLOMFGLMFAO’, which asks who needs words when you’ve got letters. Seven more songs and videos will be released over the next two months, each premiered on the ASOS website weekly on Friday mornings. ASOS might be the first brand to sign its own band but more and more fashion companies are using the power of music in their advertising and social media campaigns. Last month H&M announced that super model Gisele Bündchen is the face - and voice - of their autumn campaign. Her hitherto unheard singing voice will accompany the TV and online commercials, in which she sings along to the tune of All Day And All Of The Night by The Kinks. British brand Burberry have also ultilised popular music in their brand development. They have run a series of gigs, often held in their flagship store in London, for Burberry Acoustic, as part of a project that brings together British fashion and music. The artists are selected by the brand's Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey, who often uses live music, particularly from budding artists, as the soundtrack for his catwalk shows. Burberry's new men’s fragrance is inspired by the ‘exhilaration and adrenaline of live music' and the campaign is fronted by musician George Barnett, 25. And Brit Rhythm, the first fragrance Burberry have launched since taking its beauty business in house in April 2013, celebrated its launch with a live gig from White Lies in Shoreditch on Wednesday.",

        "document": "Kuwait (CNN) -- A former military bunker in the desert is one of the last places you might expect to find nature bloom. But above a maze of abandoned foxholes to the north of Kuwait's capital lies a landscape that shimmers green and purple with vegetation, attracting foxes, migratory birds and other wildlife. The Sabah Al-Ahmad nature reserve occupies land that once served as an important base for Saddam Hussein's army during its invasion of Kuwait from 1990-1. Iraq's annexation of its southern neighbor, which began in August 1990 and lasted until the liberation the following February, had a devastating impact not only on Kuwait's people, but its ecology, said Dr Samira Omar Asem of the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. One of Kuwait's leading environmental scientists, with three decades experience in resource conservation, Asem has played a major role in restoring Kuwait's war-ravaged ecosystems as head of the United Nations Compensation Commission's environmental remediation program. The body was established in 1991 to process claims and pay compensation damages suffered as a result of the occupation of Kuwait, and processed its final claim in 2005. The war, said Asem, resulted in \"a lot of aggression against the environment\" -- most infamously, the destruction of Kuwait's oil fields as part of Hussein's \"scorched earth\" policy on retreat. More than 700 wells were destroyed, choking the skies with black smoke in an inferno that raged for eight months before firefighters eventually extinguished the blaze. But substantial damage was inflicted during the occupation as well. As the Iraqi army swept through the country, it built an elaborate system of fortifications, destroying the fragile desert ecosystem. About 24,000 fortifications were built in the area of the reserve alone, she said. \"I saw these bunkers immediately after liberation,\" she said. \"They had services established under the ground. So you can imagine ... a natural reserve is being converted into a headquarters for military activities. The whole reserve was full of ammunition.\" The abandoned, unexploded ordnance, combined with oil from leaks or deliberately flooded trenches, has left a hazardous environment for rehabilitation workers to operate in. \"All this heavy machinery and vehicles caused a lot of soil compaction, changed the landscape, and allowed more sand to move and caused a lot of erosion,\" she said. At the Sabah Al-Ahmad nature reserve, environmental remediation has involved planting trees and building ponds to bring back wildlife, resulting in a flourishing desert ecosystem. \"This is a major achievement for the government of Kuwait, to preserve the natural history for the new generations and the existing generations,\" she said. \"It is our contribution for the international community to say that we are serious about protecting our environment.\" But the reserve is only a first step. More than one billion barrels were burned and spilled in the oil field destruction at the end of the war, and the country still bears the scars of that legacy. Outside the reserve, the deserts remain affected, with large lakes of oil -- caused by leaked crude oil mixing with the billions of gallons of seawater used to extinguish the flames -- contaminating the sands across about 100 square kilometers of desert. The clean-up effort, says Asem, still has a long way to go.

        "document": "(CNN) -- America is in trouble. And we know it. Just look at recent polls: 70% of Americans would describe the nation's economy as bad. Some 61% think our country is on the wrong track. Only 24% of Americans think the economy has actually improved in the past few years. And almost two-thirds of Americans are concerned about being able to pay for their housing. We could use Captain Economy to help us create jobs. Plus we need Deficit-Reduction Man and Five-Percent-GDP-Growth-a-Year Dude. Or maybe we can just let The Hulk loose in Congress and tell him: \"Hulk: Smash!\" (I'm not sure how Hulk smashing Congress helps the economy, but I think most of us would pay to see it.) But, alas, there's no superhero in no sight. There's only President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. I must admit that there was a time in 2008 that I thought Obama could have been a superhero, but I was wrong. We have seen his campaign theme morph in four years from \"Yes We Can\" to \"It Could Be Worse.\" In Obama's defense, his economic plan has helped the nation. Unemployment was at 10% in October 2009 and has fallen to 8.1%, and we have seen moderate job creation. But still the economy has a long way to go to match the booming growth years of the mid-2000s. We had a 4.6% unemployment rate just five years ago. So here comes superhero wannabe Romney. This silver-spooned crusader has attacked Obama by stating, \"We are enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history.\" Romney essentially admits the economy has improved since Obama took office but claims that he has the super powers that will launch our nation to infinity and beyond. Or at least, as he promised this week, his economic plan would lower the nation's unemployment rate to 6% in four years. What's Romney's solution? His website outlines a proposal for economic recovery, promising a five-point plan that he will submit immediately upon taking office, then \"demand that Congress act on the package within 30 days.\" But I think Romney might find that Congress won't be pushed around as easily as a blonde-haired kid in high school. All the \"demanding\" in the world might not get Congress to do what he wants. Romney: I'll get unemployment down to 6% . Romney calls for tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, but his big push to revitalize the economy is to reduce the deficit by cutting government spending. Here is my question for Mr. Romney: Can you please show us where this type of austerity has worked before? I'm all ears. The most recent example is the United Kingdom, where conservative Prime Minister David Cameron slashed government spending in 2010 with the promise of economic growth. The result?  The unemployment rate rose in 2011, and GDP contracted for the past two quarters, meaning that the nation is now back in a recession. In contrast, last week we learned that Japan's economy grew by an annualized rate of 4.1% in the first quarter this year. Was Japan's growth spurt caused by cutting government spending as Romney wants? Nope. Quite the opposite. The Japanese government increased expenditures. While the government spending did increase the deficit, it sparked much-needed economic growth. If either candidate is going to make super promises about revitalizing the economy, he'll have to prove his ideas have worked in the past. And if he can't do that, he should at least be brutally honest and tell us there are no easy answers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah .",

        "document": "The family of a senior First World War commander tried to get Lord Attenborough's film Oh! What A Lovely War banned because they regarded it as a 'sordid' insult to his memory. Descendants of the late Field Marshal Sir John French, who led the British Expeditionary Force from 1914 to 1915, took legal advice and appealed to the film censor. On July 7, 1968, his son Colonel John French, who has also since died, wrote to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), calling it a 'despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money'. The family's letters have been found in the BBFC archive. Scroll down for video . The family of Field Marshal Sir John French (left) tried to get Lord Attenborough's (right) film Oh! What A Lovely War banned . When told of their concern, Lord Attenborough said he had hired a 'battery of lawyers' to ensure that the musical satire was not offensive or libellous. He said that it was anti-war, but very 'pro-soldier'. In his letter to Sir John Trevelyan, the then Director of the BBFC, French is particularly alarmed by reports that his father who is to be played by Sir Laurence Olivier will be seen dancing while the casualties continue to mount up on the front line. He wrote: 'It appears to be a disgraceful performance making fun of a time of great national peril and falsely portraying the Commander-in-Chief as indulging in dancing while the fighting was going on and his men were being killed.' 'In appealing to your board to prevent this despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money, I would point out that not only the reputation of a great soldier is involved but the prestige of the British Army. Laurence Olivier's depiction of Sir John (pictured) was seen as prancing and pouting by critics . Colonel French said the production should either be banned or the offensive references to his father should be removed. Three days after receiving the letter Trevelyan wrote to Attenborough to warn him of the Colonel's concerns. Attenborough assured Trevelyan that the film was anti-war rather than anti any particular soldier. He wrote: 'When the first letter arrived, I held a special screening of all the material for a positive battery of lawyers who unanimously proclaimed that the film is neither libellous or offensive. He added: 'Let me assure you John that I would never have anything to do with a film such as the one Colonel French mentions in his letter and in fact I believe that the only way to be truly ante-war is to be pro–soldiers, for if one dislikes the soldiers, it's difficult to get concerned when they become casualties.' 'As you know we have totally eschewed blood and gore and are trying to make our points by means of speech based upon historical record. I cannot believe that Colonel French would wish to curb my right to read history aloud.' Just weeks earlier Lord Attenborough wrote to Trevelyan to share the 'dread' and 'insane' news that he was about to direct his first film. Lord Attenborough's 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War starring Kenneth Moore as the Kaiser and John Clements as Von Moltke . Vanessa Redgrave starred in the film as Sylvia Pankhurst alongside Laurence Olivier . Attenborough who would go on to direct a string of hit films including Gandhi, Shadowlands and Cry Freedom wrote: 'You might have heard but in case you haven't I write to tell you of the dread news that I am about to take the fatal step of directing my first film. Nothing easy of course, like a contained little domestic drama, but a picture shot entirely on location with almost 40 musical numbers in it and a cast that would put your eye out. You see, I am insane,' Sir John French carved out a reputation for himself during the Boer War, He headed the BEF for the first two years of the First World War and was then made Commander in Chief, Home Forces. He retired from the British Army in April 1921 and was elevated to the Earl of Ypres in 1922. Opinion about French's contribution to the war effort remains divided to this day. The late Alan Clark described him as weak willed man of medium height in Donkeys his seminal history of the first world war. But other commentators have been far more generous and they stress that French was a far more popular figure in the ranks than other senior figures like Kitchener or Haig. His family may have been right, however, to be wary of how Olivier performance which was subsequently described as pouting and prancing. Sir John French died aged 72 in 1925 and his son died in 1958. Laurence Olivier's depiction of Sir John was seen as prancing and pouting by critics.",

Van Gaal was furious with his players for allowing a 3-1 lead to slip and led a fiery dressing room inquest with his players following the capitulation. Van Gaal, who has a reputation for losing his temper with his players, was openly critical of his expensively constructed team after their second defeat in the Barclays Premier League. Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs appear in shock after Manchester United's capitulation against Leicester . United players look dejected after the fifth goal at the King Power Stadium . United players celebrate Ander Herrera's goal as the visitors raced to a 3-1 lead at the King Power Stadium . United capitulated to a humbling loss to leave Van Gaal furious at his players for ‘giving the game away’. Van Gaal’s team led 3-1 after an hour but crumbled defensively in the face of Leicester’s energetic attack to suffer defeat after leading by two goals for the first time in Premier League history – a run stretching 853 games. Jamie Vardy, playing non-League football two years ago, terrorised United’s backline with his direct running and had a hand in all the goals, winning two penalties, and finishing calmly to put Nigel Pearson’s side 4-3 up. A Leonardo Ulloa brace, David Nugent spot-kick and Esteban Cambiasso goal added to overturn strikes from Robin van Persie, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera as Leicester became only the sixth Premier League team to put five past a United side. Van Gaal named Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Van Persie in the starting line-up but afterwards complained: ‘We have too many players who want to seek for the goal.’ The match turned on Mark Clattenburg’s decision to award a soft penalty in the 62nd minute for a push by Rafael on Vardy after the Leicester striker had shoved the Brazilian to the floor to win the ball. Van Gaal gave United players the hairdryer treatment in the dressing room after the game . Van Gaal looks shattered on the bench as Leicester raced into a 5-3 lead despite the game looking done . Van Gaal declined to criticise the referee but added: ‘I am sitting on the fence. He was waiting for the push but it was stupid to do that. You know you are in the penalty area and you allow the referee to whistle if you make a challenge.’ Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was more forthright on Sky Sports, calling the decision from Clattenburg ‘shocking’. But he criticised United for splashing £150million in the transfer window without securing a ‘proper defender’. ‘Spending all that money and not bringing in a top defender is mismanagement at the end of the day,’ said the former Liverpool defender. ‘United look vulnerable like that at the back this season.’ Rafael (centre) and Wayne Rooney (right) argue with referee Mark Clattenburg after Tyler Blackett was sent off . Injury to Evans means he will miss the match against West Ham on Saturday. ‘Luke Shaw shall be fit enough to play so we can manage it but it is a thin defence,’ conceded Van Gaal. Leicester now stand seventh in the table after a tough run of fixtures and Pearson said: ‘At 3-1 down I would have been happy to get anything out of it. It says a lot about character. I think we have a bit more quality than people may be aware of.’ Vardy added: ‘We knew their full backs would push up and leave a bit of space, which was easy enough for us to exploit when we got the ball and that’s exactly what we’ve done. Every chance has gone in the back of the net.’ Radamel Falcao was taken off on his first start for United as the Colombian striker works towards full fitness .

        "document": "By . Jeannette Kupfermann . Nursing both a badly broken arm and a fractured leg, you would think I could reasonably  expect a little sympathy — especially in a  doctor’s surgery. What I got was the opposite. Arriving at my GP practice for a check-up, I found that the cast on my arm plus the orthopaedic boot I was wearing made it difficult to use the touch-screen system to announce my arrival — so I queued to ask the receptionist if she would check me in at her computer instead. But rather than taking a few seconds to help me out, with a look of triumph in her eyes she sneered: ‘Why don’t you use your other hand?’ and sent me hobbling back to the screen. Left shaken: Jeannette Kupfermann was shocked by the callous treatment she received from her GP's receptionist . I was fairly shaken, but didn’t argue because so many GP’s receptionists appear to have diplomas in sour-faced indifference. The callous, supercilious, rude and apathetic attitude of many of them must surely top most people’s list of complaints against the NHS. When we are sick, vulnerable and anxious, the surgery is our first point of contact. Yet all too often the waiting-room staff are less guardian angels than dragons at the gate. I’ve heard complaint after complaint about the bad attitudes encountered by my friends and family. Many have spoken of their frustration at being fobbed off and even lied to. Many, like me, felt dehumanised and humiliated. None are surprised to read stories of people treated appallingly by their GP’s admin staff, such as the woman last month who was forced to wait outside by a busy road after a doctor’s receptionist said her sick 16-month-old baby was crying too loudly. Rarely, if ever, are these people challenged, as they hold us over a barrel. While I accept there are plenty of good, hard-working doctors’ receptionists out there who strive to help patients, I also know there are many who can be real battleaxes. An offended receptionist equals no appointment. But after my own upsetting experience, I told my doctor what had happened. He seemed at a loss to explain and apologised. I later wrote a strong letter to the practice manager, who told me that not all staff had received their full training yet, as if that were any excuse. But as we all know, this kind of attitude tends to be the rule — and for the elderly, in particular, it can be a nightmare. It often starts with a phone call you’ve been poised to make since dawn, as having your finger on the redial button the moment surgery phone lines open is your only chance of getting through. Each month, 23 million people (more than three times the population of London) visit their GP surgery or practice nurse . My friend Peggy, a 92-year-old widow from Kent who suffers from several painful illnesses that need continual monitoring, recently had a shocking experience. ‘I was ringing to get some blood test results,’ she told me.  ‘It was difficult getting through, but eventually I spoke to a receptionist and told her I’d been asked to make an appointment to see or speak to the doctor about them. ‘She told me  to hang on  a moment while she spoke to the doctor. I waited and waited. A good 15 minutes passed before I had  to hang up. ‘An hour later I rang again, and when I got the same woman I asked her why she’d left me hanging on the phone. She replied rudely: “Because I had nothing to tell you.” ’ Eventually, Peggy rang again and was put through to another receptionist who also put her on hold. Dragons: Like Ros from Monsters Inc. many waiting room staff leave patients feeling humiliated and dehumanised . ‘She promised me faithfully she’d call back,’ says Peggy. ‘But again I waited and waited. It’s been days now and I haven’t heard a thing.’ To me, this illustrates perfectly all that is going wrong at reception — especially with the elderly, who get anxious about problems but are brushed off like irritating flies. No wonder they are so disheartened and either give up — putting their health at risk — or go to A&E. And every busy working mother will identify with the frustration of Berkshire woman Elizabeth Harris.‘I’d managed to get an appointment about getting some acne lotion for my 14-year-old daughter,’ says Elizabeth, who is in her 40s. ‘I saw the doctor, got the prescription and went next door to the pharmacy, where I was told that the lotion wasn’t available  any more. ‘I rushed back into the surgery — I was already late for work and had to fit in another appointment — but by then there was a  long queue. ‘I explained what had happened to the receptionist and asked if there was any chance she could ask the doctor if she could write me another prescription. ‘She just said: “No, I can’t. You’ll have to ring in the morning to see the doctor again.” I pointed out that the next day was Saturday, when they took only emergencies, but I might as well have been talking to a brick wall.’ It’s no surprise that figures released in 2012 showed that complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 a week, with a rise in grievances about surly receptionists. Complaints: Many others share Jeannette's frustrations . So what has gone wrong? ‘The NHS sometimes forgets that it’s a service provider and should put the patient first,’ says one senior nurse. ‘There are too many people trying to get into too few surgeries, and doctors condone their receptionists’ behaviour  because it keeps the patients at bay. ‘It reflects the state of everything else in the NHS — but that doesn’t excuse their terrible manner.’Heather Adlam, a business trainer who runs workshops for GP receptionists to help them improve their communication skills, agrees. ‘We think we’re getting something free and don’t have the right to expect too much,’ she says. ‘But it’s not “free”. ‘It’s part of the insurance we took out with the Government — we’ve all paid an awful lot into it.’ As for me, I believe the situation simply reflects how impersonal GP surgeries have become. Providing forms to fill out, stating your level of satisfaction with all stages of a GP visit, might help.This way, patients could remain anonymous. After all, none of us wants to deal with confrontation and risk not getting an appointment. But until we do so — in a civilised way — and end the intimidation, this callousness will continue.",

        "document": "'Very bitter': Martin and Jacqui Clark want the names of TripAdvisor reviewers made public . The owners of a Scottish B&B last night accused TripAdvisor of operating ‘above the law’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide. Martin and Jacqui Clark went to court in an attempt to force the £3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors. The Clarks, who run the nine-bedroom Tigh na Cheo guest house at Kinlochleven, Inverness-shire, maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious. They wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments, claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business. But their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle yesterday when a judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a request for a disclosure order to force TripAdvisor to reveal the names, addresses and other information on the authors’ identity. In a judgment that could have far-reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews, Judge Paul Arthurson, QC, ruled Scots courts have no jurisdiction in the matter. An angry Mr Clark, 55, said the ruling would allow TripAdvisor’s army of unverified reviewers free rein to post ‘anything on any pub, restaurant, guesthouse or hotel in the world and, frankly, get away with it’. He added: ‘This effectively means that TripAdvisor will continue to have a licence to defame and libel with impunity. It’s just unbelievable. My wife and I feel very bitter about it.’ In their petition, the Clarks maintained that the disputed postings purported to review events that did not take place, were not submitted by actual travellers and were not posted contemporaneously. Both writers claimed to have visited the premises in September 2011, but the reviews did not appear until February and March the following year. At an earlier hearing, Graeme Henderson, counsel for the Clarks, told the court they were applying to seek assistance from the company over the identity of the two individuals named in the reviews as ‘edna B’ and ‘dreckit’. But, the court heard TripAdvisor, whose headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, set out in its terms and conditions that users agreed that all claims against it arising from the site must be heard in the US state. Target: The owners of the nine-bedroomed Tigh Na Cheo guest house in Inverness-shire insist they were the victims of 'fabricated and malicious' reviews on TripAdvisor . The judge was told that Mr Clark accepted that he had ticked a box acknowledging that he agreed with those terms and conditions in the course of his use of the website. He said that the legislation under which the disclosure order was sought ‘does not empower the Court of Session with worldwide jurisdiction to ordain persons such as the respondents [TripAdvisor] to produce information’. The judge added: ‘I conclude that the approach contended for on behalf of the petitioners would require the court in turn to make a rather alarming entirely global assertion of jurisdiction.’ Speaking after the ruling, Mr Clark said: ‘It seems this company can effectively do what it wants in the UK – it’s above the law.’ He added the upset caused by the case had prompted him and his 50-year-old wife to try to sell the B&B. Though considering their position over an appeal, Mr Clark said: ‘I don’t think we can go any further from here because it will just go on and on and I am not prepared to fork out another sizeable amount of money.’ A TripAdvisor spokesman said it did not comment on individual cases of litigation but insisted it took fraud seriously. He said: ‘Every single review goes through our tracking system, which maps the how, what, where and when of each review, and we use sophisticated automated tools and algorithms to spot patterns of  unusual activity. We back that up with a team of over 200 content specialists, who work 24/7 to maintain the quality of our reviews.’ Since it was founded by . entrepreneur Stephen Kaufer only 14 years ago, TripAdvisor has grown . into the world’s largest travel website and one of the most . controversial. With . more than 200 million visitors a month worldwide trusting its . recommendations to book trips, a run of good or bad reviews can . potentially make or break a business. But . there are consistent grumbles that the website is growing too powerful . and its system of unverified reviews is too open to abuse. Three . years ago, the Advertising Standards Authority began an investigation . into the firm before ordering it to remove its slogan ‘reviews you can . trust’ and banning it from claiming reviews are from ‘real’ travellers. In . 2012, a new link was established with Facebook allowing users to see . reviews written by members on their ‘friends’ list. As a result, a . previously anonymous user was exposed as Peter Hook, a hotel executive, . who had posted glowing reviews about his firm’s properties. The . same year, KwikChex, a reputation- management company, deliberately . submitted three fake reviews for a defunct restaurant. Just over a month . later, the reviews were still on the site and the restaurant had risen . to 17th best in London. Also . in 2012, Helen Griffiths, a marketing manager from Salford, was ordered . to apologise as part of a police caution for  harassment after posting . 30 false and malicious reviews about a vegan restaurant, The Good Life, . on TripAdvisor. She . admitted: ‘I made these comments based on absolutely no knowledge of . the business, or any of the company’s staff, as I have never actually . visited or eaten at the restaurant.’ Last . year, fresh doubts about the global giant’s fraud detection system, . based on anti-credit card and insurance fraud algorithms, were raised . after a non–existent business briefly became one of the most highly . rated restaurants in Brixham, Devon. A . TripAdvisor spokesman said every one of the 60 reviews posted every . minute was checked using the system, but added: ‘No system, verified or . not, is perfect, and we are continually working to stay ahead of those . attempting to cheat the system.’",

        "document": "Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Who is Amanda Knox? Is she a two-faced she-devil, angelic and compassionate to some but Satanic and Lucifer-like to others? That's what Carlo Pacelli, the lawyer for a man Knox falsely accused in the 2007 murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, called her as he summed up his case last week. Is she \"Foxy Knoxy,\" as the British tabloid press leered and sneered at her within hours of her exoneration in Kercher's murder Monday? Or is she the fresh-faced girl from Seattle she still appears to be, even after spending nearly four years behind bars before her conviction was quashed? Is Knox simply the victim of character assassination, painted falsely as a \"femme fatale\" by prosecutors and media the world over? Defense lawyer Giulia Bongiorno advanced that theory in her own closing argument. She compared Knox to Jessica Rabbit, the hourglass-shaped, husky-voiced cartoon character who insists in the movie \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" that she's not bad, she's just \"drawn that way.\" Five women and three men on a jury here weighed in decisively on who Knox is Monday, throwing out the five most serious charges she was originally convicted of in connection with Kercher's death and releasing her from prison. Audible gasp in courtroom as verdict is read . The jury also freed Raffaele Sollecito, her former boyfriend who became her co-defendant. Their release came at the end of an appeal lasting just over four months and feeling much more like a re-trial than an appeal as understood in the United States or Kercher's native Britain. Lawyers battled on two fronts -- DNA evidence and Knox's character. Police scientists argued that a knife found at Sollecito's home had traces of Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's DNA on the handle. And they testified that a bra clasp belonging to Kercher and found in her room had Sollecito's genetic material on it. Experts appointed by the court questioned police handling of the evidence, suggesting authorities' sloppiness could make the DNA results unreliable and should make them inadmissible in court. Prosecution witnesses, meanwhile, maintained that the tests were valid -- leading to highly technical and sometimes heated courtroom arguments and prompting the prosecution to ask for new DNA tests, a request the judge rejected. No end to Knox as pop culture obsession . Knox and Sollecito do not have airtight alibis for the night of November 1, 2007, when Kercher's throat was slashed, her semi-naked body left under a bed cover. Their cell phones and Sollecito's computer were switched off at the time of the murder, depriving them of potentially exculpatory evidence. But while they cannot prove they were not at the scene of the crime, their defense team says the prosecution cannot prove that they were. There was no physical trace of them in the room where Kercher died, Knox and Sollecito's lawyers insisted. They argued that the crime was solely the work of drifter Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately and is serving 16 years. His DNA was all over the crime scene, the defense said. That may have been enough for the jury to set Knox and Sollecito free. Defense lawyer Luciano Ghirga reminded the jury repeatedly Monday morning that the prosecution needed to prove its case \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" -- a standard he made a point of saying was rooted in Italian law and was not imported from America, in a nod to the nationalistic tensions that have sometimes seemed to underpin this case. The jury must have had sufficient doubts to overturn a verdict rendered by eight of their compatriots less than two years ago. That means that either Knox and Sollecito were the victims of a miscarriage of justice then, or that Kercher is now. Only Knox and Sollecito themselves may know which it is -- because nearly four years after Kercher's death, incontrovertible evidence about whether Knox and Sollecito were involved remains maddeningly elusive. CNN's Hada Messia and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.",

A pet store owner from Richland, Washington who wants to promote healthy eating for pets and their owners has vowed to only eat animal food for an entire month. Dorothy Hunter, the owner of Paws Natural Pet Emporium, didn't have time to get a snack one day while she was stocking shelves so she nibbled on a treat meant for dogs and it wasn't too shabby. 'I didn't have time to go get a snack,' she told NBC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dorothy Hunter, co-owner of Paw's Natural Pet Emporium, shares a chicken jerky dog treat with her furry friend after vowing to eat pet food for an entire month . Dorothy Hunter claims that the treats she sells in her store meant for dogs are healthier than the average breakfast bar designed for humans . 'so I grabbed a bag of treats off the counter, and I was like, wow, you know, these read better than normal people treats. So I started eating the treats and I was like, you know, I could do this for 30 days,' she said. Hunter's been eating salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken meant for cats and dogs for a week now and she can see herself following her strictly pet-food diet for three more weeks. Dorothy says she isn't eating dog food because she prefers the taste, rather she is trying to promote health for animals and people alike. When comparing the ingredients in a breakfast bar meant for a human versus a breakfast bar meant for a pet she found that the animal treat was healthier than its human counterpart and that the ingredients were much easier to understand. She says the health benefits of eating pet food were immediately noticeable. She reported losing weight and not feeling as tired at the end of the day as she usually does. Dorothy Hunter was restocking the shelves in her store one day when she didn't have time to grab a snack so she opted for dog treats instead . Dorothy has been sharing the food with her co-workers who say that while the taste is a little dry that it's not so bad . 'My feet aren't swelling as much as they usually do after I've been on a 10 hour day,' said Dorothy. 'I have lost 2.5 pounds, which i'm not going to complain about that, but I'm not doing this to promote dog food, or to loose weight... But at the same token I want to show that I believe in our products.' She also says she doesn't mind the taste of salmon flakes and freeze dried chicken. She's even developed some favorite pet food choices. 'I've also been doing our oven baked blueberry treats, as well as freeze dried green beans, carrots,' she told NBC. 'I'm even doing some canned cat food, one is a succulent chicken, and it actually tastes really good. So I'm really happy with that one. I don't do raw bones or meat products like that, or the frozen because i'm just not into raw.' Despite only eating pet food, Dorothy says she hasn't given up on coffee and that's for the benefit pf her employees so that she doesn't fall asleep on the job. Otherwise, she'd be in the dog house.",

According to sources close to the president, who spoke to news magazine L'Express, he has been advised to usher in 'a bachelor presidency', which would be 'an element of modernisation for the role of president'. Meanwhile French TV station Itélé reported that Mr Hollande told a group of journalists: 'I do not want there to be first lady in the future at the Elysée.'

Florent Massonneau said: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded . is disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’ It came as a new poll revealed that 77 per cent of  French people are ‘dissatisfied’ with Hollande’s presidency. Today such figures were expected to rise, as the growing crisis was set to be played out in La Lanterne. Built for the bodyguard of the pre-Revolutionary monarch Louis XVI, it has long been viewed by the left as a symbol of unacceptable wealth and privilege. Valerie Trierweiler left hospital in Paris on Saturday after reportedly overdosing on sleeping pills, and is now 'resting' at the president's country house in Versailles .

Despite having her own flat in Paris, Ms Trierweiler, 48, was driven to the the magnificent presidential home on Saturday afternoon after spending eight days in a private hospital room suffering from stress. It was caused by hearing claims about Mr Hollande’s secret two year affair with the film and TV actress Julie Gayet, 41. As Ms Gayet remained in hiding, a  source close to the president confirmed that he ‘planned to see’ Ms Trierweiler today, and that he and the first lady would be ‘discussing their future’. Mr Hollande only saw Ms Trierweiler once in hospital, and even then only after she had been at the Pitie-Salpetriere for more than a week. President Hollande has been accused of having an affair with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet . The leader is due to reveal whether Ms Trierweiler will continue in her role as the First Lady next month . Ms Trierweiler is desperately trying to hang on to her role, despite clear indications that Mr Hollande wants to make Ms Gayet his first lady. In an attempt to drum up public support, Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter on Saturday night to write: ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who sent messages of support ... very touched’. Her words were met with an avalanche of ridicule, with people describing her as everything from ‘the Rottweiler’ to the new Marie-Antoinette, after the high-living wife of Louis XVI who was eventually guillotined. A new Ifop/idd poll in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals 37 per cent of France is ‘very discontented’ with Hollande’s presidency, and 40 per cent are simply ‘discontented’. Mr Hollande visited his political heartland of Correze, in central France, on Saturday, but again refused to answer questions about who his real first lady was. Instead Bernard Combes, the Socialist mayor of Combes – a job Mr Hollande had for seven years – said: ‘France's political situation requires all of the president's attention and all of his time, so obviously it would be best for everyone if he can resolve the problems in his personal life under good conditions.’ The French President greeted constituents in Tulle as the scandal surrounding his alleged infidelities continues .

        "document": "By . Pete D'amato for MailOnline . One more casualty of the VA hospital system. Edward Laird, a 76-year-old Navy veteran, was kept waiting at the Phoenix VA hospital for a biopsy to determine whether a blemish on his nose was cancerous. Two and a half years later, the cancer had progressed so far that 70% of his nose needed to be removed, Laird told CNN. Scroll down for video . Neglected: Edward Laird, 76, was repeatedly denied a biopsy at the dermatology clinic of the VA hospital and his nose was taken over by cancer . Laird first learned he might have a problem when his physician at the Phoenix VA hospital referred for a biopsy at the VA dermatology clinic. At the clinic, the biopsy was repeatedly delayed. The cancer spread through much of the nose, requiring immediate surgery. The reconstructive surgery left Laird using a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril. The Phoenix VA where Laird went for treatment was at the center of a scandal in April after CNN connected the deaths of 40 veterans to hidden waiting lists. Dr. Sam Foote, a former VA doctor, blew the whistle on the facility for keeping two waiting lists, one with the actual list of patients awaiting care, the other with patients ready to receive care in the next 14 days. Foote says the dummy lists were sent to Washington to create the illusion that the hospital saw patients within an acceptable waiting time, which is normally considered 14 to 30 days. An investigation of the delays by the Department of Veteran Affairs' Office of Inspector General blasted 'clinically significant delays' for dozens of veterans but did not conclude the delays led to any deaths. Laird says he relies on VA care since his only other insurance option now is Medicare Part A, which does not cover outpatient care. Laird says that in spite of the lines, he feels proud to go to the VA hospital if it means standing among fellow veterans. 'When you go, there you feel like you're walking along with a bunch of champions,' Laird said. 'It'll jerk a tear from you sometimes.'",

The son of former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson saved his sister's life by guiding an ambulance to a remote vineyard where they were staying in France - using a bottle of wine. Max Willson, 16, rushed to help his 10-year-old sister Mini after she put her hand through a pane of glass and severed an artery while they were on holiday at the family's French château. Their father was in Britain working and their mother was out at the time of the accident and the panicked teenager  did not know the address of the rural house to call emergency services. Instead he attempted to stem the bleeding by using a towel, some duct tape, a place mat and a dog lead to hold it in place. He then remembered they kept wine produced at the vineyard in the château cellar and rushed to grab a bottle so he could find the address on the label. The teenager, who has Asperger's Syndrome, searched Google to find out how to ring emergency services in France before using a translator to explain to authorities what happened. Through his directions, paramedics were able to find the estate and take his sibling, who was nine at the time of the accident, to hospital for treatment. Max said: 'I knew time was of the essence. You could bleed out with a wound like that. 'I put a red towel on a sign close to the house so they would know where to come to. 'At the end of the ordeal, I realised it's pretty amazing what you can do under pressure.' Scroll down for video . The children were on holiday with their mother Michaela at the picturesque Chateau Gourgues near Saint-Emilion in the Bordeaux region of France in August last year when the accident happened. Their father, former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson, was back in the UK at the time and his wife, who was on holiday with their children, was out . Max did not know the chateau's address but remembered the wine they kept in the cellar had the vineyard's address on and read that to call handler . Max, who boards at £27,000-a-year Bredon School near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, partly credits the training he received through the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for saving his sister's life. The CCF is a Ministry of Defence-sponsored youth organisation which runs courses in school and Max has now been nominated him for a CCF award. His motoring journalist father, who has appeared on several TV and radio shows including a stint on Top Gear, said: 'l'm enormously proud of him. 'For Max to cope like that on his own in a foreign country it makes his achievement even more impressive,' he added. 'Had he not acted so quickly, Mini might not be here now.' He praised his son's school for providing cadet training and said it was doing a great job and he had written to the headmaster to tell him so. 'We underestimate these kids with these syndromes,' he said. 'It's surprising. When they're in the right educational environment, they can do stuff that the rest of us can't.' Mr Willson bought Chateau Gourgues in 2005 and spent four years restoring it to its original grandeur complete with towers and turrets. The journalist and his wife try to visit every weekend, and the family spent eight weeks at the vineyard, which produces Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rosé, over the summer. In 2008 his Rosé won the highly commended award at the International Wine Challenge, and it is now stocked in local restaurants.

        "document": "By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 05:52 EST, 19 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:55 EST, 19 March 2012 . Astronomers who scan the skies for dangerous asteroids – space rocks that might cross the Earth’s path – are in line for a huge funding boost from Nasa. The U.S space agency is awarding $4.1 million (£2.6m) to the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), based at the University of Arizona (UA), to upgrade its search capabilities. Most will consider this money well spent, since some asteroids, were they to crash land on Earth, would be capable of causing global devastation. Ever watchful: The CSS's Schmidt Telescope scans the skies for dangerous space rocks . The money will be used to upgrade and operate the CSS telescopes through to 2015. The CSS program, part of the UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, has led the search for so-called near-Earth objects, or NEOs, since 2005. CSS consists of two wide-field survey telescopes and a dedicated follow-up telescope located in the Catalina mountains north of Tucson, Arizona. Sky's the limit: The Schmidt Telescope is located on Mt. Bigelow in the Catalina Mountains just north of Tucson, Arizona . In 2011 the CSS science team discovered 586 near-Earth asteroids, representing 65 per cent of NEO discoveries for the year. In addition to its record-setting searches for asteroids, the team was the first to observe an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth, allowing it to be tracked and eventually recovered as meteorites in the desert of Northern Sudan. Their large and growing data set has also found new relevance in the search for objects far beyond the solar system. With their new grant, CSS astronomers will be able to expand the power of their largest telescope four-fold, develop more sensitive software, and conduct their search more nights every month. ‘Nasa has recognised that over the last seven years, our program has constantly strived to improve its performance, and has collaborated with others to find new ways to exploit the nearly 1,000 images we take every night with our two telescopes in the mountains north of Tucson,’ said Edward Beshore, principal investigator of the Catalina Sky Survey. ‘I think NASA recognises the CSS as a valuable service to, well, humanity.’ To spot NEOs, CSS observers use two telescopes to take four images of selected portions of the sky, spaced about 10 minutes apart. Software then processes the images, looking for faint objects that appear to be moving across the sky in a straight line. Specialised software then removes known asteroids, applies filters to remove false detections and presents the results to the observer for final validation. Asteroids suspected of qualifying as NEOs are reported to the Smithsonian Institution for analysis and follow-up images are scheduled. It takes several hours of such observations to reveal whether an object is an NEO. Finally, objects whose orbits intersect with the Earth's are called out for additional study by amateur and professional astronomers around the world. A key element of the new grant, a more powerful camera will allow the project to cover more sky with the 1.5-meter telescope on the summit of Mt. Lemmon. CSS co-investigator Steve Larson, who designed the new camera, said: ‘When we began observing in 2000, our image sensor was 16 megapixels, which was large by any standard. Today, commonly available consumer digital cameras have surpassed that size, and we were reaching the limit of productivity with our current camera design.’ A few years ago, Spectral Instruments, a local vendor of scientific imaging systems, presented a sensor totalling 110 megapixels. Together with Tucson-based optical designer Richard Buchroeder, Larson developed a powerful new camera system that would increase the amount of sky it can cover each month by four times. Danger: Some asteroids have the destructive power of nuclear bombs . ‘We believe this will translate into a nearly proportional increase in the number of discoveries we make each month,’ Larson said. The grant will facilitate other enhancements too, such as support additional software development to improve the speed and sensitivity of the CSS software, and the addition of a new observer that will allow them to work more nights each month. The CSS program is not limited to the search for asteroids. A spinoff project called the Catalina Realtime Transient Survey makes further use of the data acquired for the asteroid survey. ‘We image the entire sky every month with our telescope on Mt. Bigelow,’ Beshore said, ‘in partnership with colleagues at Caltech who had developed software to search for changes in the stationary cosmic objects. Almost as fast as we can acquire the data, they are able to detect changes in the brightness of stars and galaxies that can reveal important clues about objects millions of times farther away than the asteroids we search for.’",

Rubbish collectors are protesting at proposed cuts to their working conditions as the Andalusian city's municipal government battles to balance its books. So far around 6,000 tons of rubbish have been left uncollected since the strike started. It started when the management of Lipasam, Seville's municipal street cleaning company, rejected a plan by the city council to reduce the garbage collectors' wages by five per cent while increasing their working hours. A young girl rides her bike past a mound of garbage during the ninth day of the Seville waste disposal strike . A woman pushes her pram while walking past a pile of trash in the Andalusian capital of Seville . Sixteen hundred workers walked out leaving the rubbish to clog up the narrow streets of the capital of Andalusia. Over the past three months, similar . strikes by garbage collectors also occurred in Jérez de la Frontera and . Granada, two of Andalusia’s other large tourist cities. 'It's clear that striking can have a . much larger impact when it concerns something as visible to citizens as . garbage,' said Ángel Gallego Morales, the president of the economic and . social council of Andalusia, the regional body that oversees relations . among the government, companies and unions. 'We can only hope that this will soon end, even if there is no sign of any willingness to compromise right now.' More recently, the garbage problem . has even taken on a criminal dimension, as containers have been set on . fire. The fires have occurred mostly in the city's southern districts, . far from the historic downtown, the New York Times reported. Antonio Bazo, the president of the . workers' committee of Lipasam, condemned the fires as criminal acts of . delinquency and denied that employees of his company were responsible . for any of them.

Workers are striking over demands they take a five per cent pay cut and extent their working week to 37.5 hours . 'We're not burning containers because . what we want is exactly the opposite, which is that the rubbish be seen . in the streets,' Mr. Bazo told the Europa Press news agency. Under Spanish employment law, Lipasam . has to guarantee that 30 per cent of the normal quantity of garbage is . collected even during a strike, particularly around hygiene-sensitive . areas like hospitals and slaughterhouses. City officials have also ensured that waste does not pile up around Seville's cathedral, the city's main tourist draw. Over the past three months, similar strikes by garbage collectors also occurred in Jérez de la Frontera and Granada, two of Andalusia¿s other large tourist cities .

A stink: A woman holds her nose as she walks past another pile of rubbish . A man throws a rubbish bag over a pile of trash during the ninth day of strike by garbage collectors against pay cuts . Spain’s Prime Minister is facing increasing calls to quit as a corruption scandal engulfs his government. Mariano Rajoy is fighting for his political future after El Pais newspaper claimed the Popular Party leader received secret annual payments averaging €25,000 (£22,000) between 1997 and 2008. The cash allegedly came from a slush fund, run by former party treasurer Luis Barcenas, who reportedly received millions of Euros in illegal payments from firms bidding for contracts. It is an allegation Rajoy strenuously denies. Protesters yesterday jeered at Barcenas as he left prosecutors’ offices where he was questioned. People shouted 'thief' and 'give the money back' at Luis Barcenas as he left the anti-corruption prosecutors’ office Wednesday. The story has unnerved financial markets - with investors worried that a change in leadership would render Spain unable to address its considerable debts. This had led to the Government’s borrowing costs being pushed back up at a time when it is trying to save money and pay off its debts to avoid bankruptcy. As the 17-nation eurozone’s fourth largest economy, Spain is seen as being too large to bail out - unlike the smaller economies of Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Therefore, analysts fear a failure to pay off its debts could collapse the eurozone as a whole. The allegations have also sparked further civil unrest in the country with Spaniards, already bitter over enduring the painful austerity measures, taking to the streets in their thousands to show their anger. Protests against Rajoy at the weekend in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville turned violent as clashes erupted with police. A petition calling for Rajoy’s resignation has been signed by more than 900,000 people, and opinion polls claim a staggering 85 per cent of the nation now has ‘little faith’ in him. It comes as unemployment figures rose again to 26 per cent this week, with an astonishing 55 per cent of young people out of work, and experts predict that worse is yet to come. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, leader of the socialist opposition, has joined in the calls for Rajoy, who was elected in 2011, to quit for the ‘good of the country’. He said: ‘Rather than the solution for this country, Rajoy has become yet another problem. He should give up his role as the head of the government and cede his place to another leader because he cannot tackle the very difficult situation confronting Spain.’ The scandal first erupted last week when El Pais published what it claims were handwritten excerpts from Barcenas’ accounting books. They appear to show a regular distribution of under-the-table cash payments to a host of senior party members, including Rajoy. Rajoy, speaking on Saturday, categorically denied the claims by saying ‘I have never received nor distributed undeclared money’ and promised to publish details of his income online. Sources close to the leadership claim Rajoy has been a victim of a ‘smear campaign’ and that the documents had been doctored. The PP has also revealed it will take legal action, but its exact nature has not yet been disclosed. Barcenas, who is under separate investigation after it was revealed he had amassed €29million(£25million) in a secret Swiss bank account, also denies the claims.",

On May 3, 1999, a total of 74 tornadoes pummeled Kansas and Oklahoma, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The states counted a total of 46 dead. Thirty-six died in Oklahoma City. The strongest tornado, rated a maximum EF5 on the Fujita Tornado Scale, tracked for nearly an hour and a half along a 38-mile path from Chickasha through south Oklahoma City and the suburbs of Bridge Creek, Newcastle, Moore, Midwest City and Del City. Monday's tornado in Oklahoma city, with a preliminary rating of at least EF4, also struck Moore and Newcastle. Dozens -- some of them elementary school children -- died, authorities said. The tornado \"hit along the same path of the May 3 tornado in 1999,\" said Gov. Mary Fallin. \"It's just hard to believe that something like this could happen again to Moore itself.\" According to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, the 1999 Oklahoma City twister was among the costliest in U.S. history, with damage totaling at $1 billion. Albert Ashwood, director of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, told reporters the two tornadoes are \"equally devastating.\" 10 deadliest U.S. tornadoes on record . \"And I think the fact that what we see so far today is going to be very similar if not exceed what we saw in 1999,\" he said. \"But keep in mind, any time there's a loss of life, it's a devastating disaster.\" Heather Moore survived both the 1999 and Monday's storms. \"It was very, very similar,\" Moore told CNN's Piers Morgan. \"Cars were turned over, some houses were half gone, some houses were all gone. ... All the trees are gone, all the power lines are gone.\" U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who lives in Moore, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the damage he was seeing on television Monday looked as bad as the 1999 tornado that destroyed more than 1,000 houses in his hometown. Moore is located between Oklahoma City and Norman -- home to the University of Oklahoma -- on the south side of the metropolitan area. The second deadliest tornado in the Oklahoma City area occurred on June 12, 1942, with 35 residents killed, according to the National Weather Service. How to help .

Chris Christie wasn’t willing to leave his job as New Jersey governor to be Mitt Romney’s running mate because he believed the former Massachusetts governor would lose, sources said. Several sources exclusively told the New York Post that the fiery New Jersey governor doubted a win, and thought serving as Romney’s vice presidential nominee wasn’t worth the risk. The main reason for Christie’s doubt, one source said, stemmed from Romney’s choice to only release limited tax returns, as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer. Doubt: NJ governor Chris Christie, right, doubted Mitt Romney's win one source told the New York Post . The odd couple: Another source said Christie's doubt stemmed from Romney's choice to only release limited tax returns, as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer . One source told the Post: ‘There were people around him that wanted him to reconsider, to actually push to be vice president. But he’s known there are real issues here. Chris knows the score.’ Sources also said that the outspoken governor also worried about a Romney-Christie ticket because of two Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Because of the way the laws have been written, large banks and investment advisers would not be allowed to . Thus, Christie, who will turn 50 next month, would have had to step down from his government position to ensure top campaign donations. Another source from the Romney campaign added: ‘Christie refused to resign under any circumstances. It had nothing to do with Chris’ personality and everything to do with money.’ The governor has not yet commented on the Post's front-page story. Choice: Romney instead chose US Congressman Paul Ryan, right, seen giving a speech in Ohio last week ahead of the Republican National Convention . However, Politico’s Maggie Haberman finds several issues with what the sources were saying. She writes today: ‘No one has ever suggested Christie was actually offered the VP post, although he was in contention, and it seems unlikely he would have asked not to be considered.’ She said the bigger implication in the Post’s exclusive was that he thought Romney would lose the election. Christie will deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, which has now been squeezed into three days because of Tropical Storm Isaac. He has already been actively posting pictures ahead of the event on his Tumblr page. Republicans already in Florida for the convention are already buzzing about the possibility of a Christie 2016 ticket. Assemblyman John Amodeo told New Jersey’s Star Ledger: ‘I don’t want to be negative, and I really hope that Romney wins, but God forbid, if he loses, I would love to support the governor.’ Risky business: If he ran with Romney, Christie would have had to resigned from his governor post because of laws that don't allow for large donations to presidential campaigns for current governors . When the reporter first asked about the possible ticket, Delegate Amodeo pumped his fists in the air out of excitement. The governor, who is known for his tough public image and short temper with off-topic reporters, took his office in 2010. He told Oprah this past January that despite his list of political achievements, he still struggles daily with this weight, adding that he was working with a personal trainer several times a week and starting a diet to help trim down his waistline. However, it seems that the governor’s frame has shrunk very little – if at all – since the interview last winter, an issue that Russell Riley of the University of Virginia’s Presidential Oral History Program said may be a hindrance for a presidential run. Keynote: Gov. Christie will deliver the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention; he posted this picture of his and Romney's political buttons ahead of the event . Readying: A man cleans the stage inside the Tampa Bay Times Forum before the start of the Republican National Convention . Riley told Bloomberg Businessweek: ‘We live in a media age in which there are these conventional expectations of what a successful individual looks like. The closer you comport with those kind of cultural ideas about how someone on television looks, the better you do.’ Christie’s weight and prominent position has made him the punch line of many late-night talk show hosts, most notably Jimmy Kimmel. While hosting this year’s the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, the ABC late night host quipped: ‘It’s not the Olive Garden state.’ Following the dinner, Christie returned with a retort of his own, saying that at least he got to dine next to Modern Family’s Sofia Vergara.",

Brothel madam: Jenine Jones was caught red-handed when police officers found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown . Her wealthy home counties clients might have expected their horse riding instructor to take a second job for extra income. But Jenine Jones’s choice of alternative business is probably not what they had in mind. The 41-year-old was found guilty of helping to run a seedy brothel above a motorbike shop. To supplement her equestrian earnings, she worked as a madam in the evenings, a court heard, taking phone calls from punters and gathering takings of up to £400 a day from Eastern European prostitutes using the premises. The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000. Jones was caught red-handed when police officers raided the building and found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown. She told them: ‘Thank God it’s you, I thought we were being robbed.’ Reading Crown Court heard that Jones, who is a woman of previous good character, helped run the brothel in Newbury, Berkshire, with owner Meinir Kirlew, 51. The illicit business attracted up to 20 clients a day after advertisements were placed in the local papers promising ‘relaxing and unhurried massages’. Prostitutes from other countries including Latvia and the Czech Republic paid £20 per client to Kirlew for use of the premises. Jones updated the owner by text message, telling her how many clients there had been and where she had hidden the day’s takings. One read: ‘Had 19, just off, see you next week.’ Another said: ‘Had a complaint about Anna today about poor service.’ A reply from Kirlew to Jones read: ‘Ok hun, did you leave the money and where?’ The response: ‘Yes bottom of sink bin.’ On the day of the police raid, November 9 last year, officers found two prostitutes and one client surrounded by pornographic material, oils, towels and baby wipes. Brothel: A number of Eastern European prostitutes were found to be working above a shop in Newbury . Prosecutor Rebecca Austin told the . court: ‘In the lounge of the flat was a woman. She stated she was . working as a prostitute one day a week. ‘She . earned an average £200 a day. In her make-up bag was a bundle of cash. She explained that the money was her takings from the clients.’ ‘Officers . went upstairs. In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a . state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a . room.’ Jones, who had . panicked and climbed on to the roof, surrendered herself to the officers . but claimed she was just a weekly cleaner. Property: The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000 . A total of £680 in cash was seized from the brothel along with eight mobile phones. 'In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a room' Rebecca Austin, prosecuting . Jones, . wearing a blue flowery dress, black tights, and dark heels as she stood . in the dock, was convicted of assisting in the management of a brothel. Summing up the case, Judge . Angela Morris said: ‘When you consider what was found at the house, . what was contained in the  interview and what was contained in her text . messages it might be this amounts to someone who was doing more than . menial tasks.’ Kirlew, from Cardiff, had already pleaded guilty to managing a brothel.

        "document": "By . Paul Bentley . and John Stevens . A Somali Muslim allegedly stabbed a policeman and three mosque worshippers after screaming: ‘Allah is going to punish you all.’ The 32-year-old is said to have tried to kill the worshippers during an argument over whether they were praying correctly. It is thought the man, who was not a regular at the mosque in Birmingham, became upset because the prayers were not being performed in the manner of his denomination. Attack: The police officer and three other people were stabbed at a mosque (pictured with sign, right) in the Ward End area of Birmingham. The four are in a 'stable' condition, according to a police spokesman . Police at the scene of the incident. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder  after the attack . One witness, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘I heard shouting behind me as I was praying. I turned . around and saw two men grappling with each other. ‘Suddenly a man pulled out a knife and . stabbed the other man in the leg, near the groin. 'Someone tried to . intervene but the man just went for him and thrust a knife into his . abdomen. It was absolutely terrifying.’ Minutes later two police officers, one . male and one female, arrived at the Madrasah Qasim-ul-Uloom mosque in . Ward End and the man allegedly ran at them with a large combat knife. Despite the male officer shooting him with a Taser, the man is said to . have stabbed him in his chest and stomach. The suspect, a 32-year-old Somalian man, was taken to a secure mental health facility today . Hand wound: Dr Arshad Mahmood     had his hand stabbed by the knifeman in the Birmingham mosque . ‘The police tried to Taser . the man but he didn’t fall down,’ the witness continued. ‘Instead he . just lunged at the officer after pulling out his knife again and stabbed . him. There was blood everywhere.’ Despite his serious injuries the 31-year-old officer ‘heroically’ overcame the man. The officer was with his family in . hospital yesterday preparing for surgery. Two of the other men were . being treated for multiple stab wounds following the attack just after . 11pm on Saturday. An off-duty surgeon who happened to be at prayers fought to keep them alive before paramedics arrived. Another man, Dr Arshad Mahmood, who . had his hand stabbed while trying to disarm the attacker, said: . ‘Everyone was frightened. It was so sudden. The mosque is a converted house. Violence broke out shortly before 11pm on Saturday following late night prayers . ‘A man started stabbing one of the . guys who was just sitting right next to him. 'We went to save him. He had . multiple injuries, three or four wounds. 'A few of us went to stop him. One of the guys was strong enough to stop him. I held his hand. One also . had an injury on his thigh.’ Another witness said: ‘He shouted . “Allah is going to punish you all”. He stabbed two people then one guy . restrained him and someone called the police.’ The suspect was being . held yesterday in a mental health facility on suspicion of attempted . murder. The attack comes less than a month . after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, south London, . allegedly by knifemen boasting they were avenging the death of Muslims . by the military. The male officer, who has not yet been . named, was due to receive a bravery award this week for helping to save . the life of a young child in a separate incident last year. Chief Superintendent Alex Murray, of . West Midlands Police, praised the policeman, saying: ‘There was some . real brave action going on inside that mosque.’ He added: ‘There’s no connection with . any other incidents that we can see at the moment – for example, . Woolwich or other incidents around the country. 'There’s no information . at this stage to suggest it was a hate crime.’ Many people living locally stood out on the street to watch what was happening as police maintained a presence in the area . West Midlands Police would be ‘looking into details’ about why the Taser had no effect on the suspect. Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said: ‘This was not a hate crime, this was a tragic, sad, and isolated incident.’ Mohammed Shafiq, of national Muslim . organisation the Ramadhan Foundation, said: ‘We must be clear there . should be no place for this sort of violence in our country.’ An eyewitness said the stabbing happened after a row at the Madrasah Qasim ul Uloom mosque .

        "document": "Eliaquim Mangala has spoken of the difficulty he had staying fit while waiting for his £31.9million move to Manchester City to go through. City made Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football on Monday after finally agreeing terms with FC Porto and an investment company who owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. The 23-year-old agreed personal terms and passed a medical on a visit to Manchester last month, but has been training on his own since returning from the World Cup and a brief holiday while he waited for his future to be resolved. VIDEO Scroll down to see Eliaquim Mangala score with cheeky back heel volley . Chuffed: Eliaquim Mangala poses with a Man City shirt following his move to the Etihad Stadium . Patient: He has admitted that it was hard to stay fit as he waited for the move to go through . ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure,’ said Mangala in his first interview with City’s club website. ‘I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time in order to be 100 per cent but it is normal – it is like those who returned to training last week, but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible. ‘I am really very happy to be part of the team and I will work hard because we have lots of goals and it is very important to start to work as soon as possible.’ Mangala is determined to add to his medal collection in Manchester after winning league titles in Portugal and Belgium with Porto and Standard Liege. And he promised City fans that he will bring a winning mentality to Manuel Pellegrini’s team. Pricey: He became the most expensive defender in British football history following move from Porto . Acquisition: The defender played for Porto for three seasons before signing for Manuel Pellegrini . ‘When I am on the pitch, I always give everything from the first to the last minute,’ he added. ‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win. I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season. ‘I am quite a fast defender. I am good in challenges, good in the air. I have the ability to score goals and have done so in the past few seasons. I won’t score 10 goals-a-season but for a defender I get my share from set-pieces. ‘I am motivated because to be part of a team like City I have already proved that I have a certain value, but I will not stop trying to improve. ‘To be part of a squad is good but like everybody else I want to play and it will be down to the manager to make his choice. I will work hard to try to have a spot in the starting XI but the most important is that the team win the games, win titles. It is my main goal: work in order to help the team to win as many titles as possible.’ Manchester United and Chelsea were also linked with Mangala but the France World Cup defender admits that he was impressed by City’s success in recent years and the fact that they made the most effort to bring him to English football. ‘City is a big team in England and they proved it again this year by winning the title,’ he said. ‘Then it is the team that showed me the most interest. I had the opportunity to talk with the manager and the football director and it is also important to have some guarantees when you move to a new club. I had this opportunity to talk and I liked what they said so I signed with City. ‘The squad is great so it will allow me to progress again. I am also someone who likes to win titles and I know that with the squad we have we can do great things.’ Partner: Mangala is set to form a central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany . Follow on: He will join former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined the club earlier in the summer . Challenge: And he will be fighting for his place against Martin Demichelis . Mangala is expected to form a first-choice central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany but he will face competition from Martin Demichelis. Pellegrini also has Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik at his disposal, although Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards are expected to move on. ‘Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis are two players who possess great experience,’ said Mangala. ‘Vincent is the captain of Manchester City and the Belgium national team, Demichelis has enjoyed a great career. He played for Bayern Munich and he is now at Manchester City and has a big experience behind him. ‘They are players that I can look at and from whom I will learn a lot. They will have lots of advice for me regarding what they have already experienced. It will help me to progress and I am sure that everything will be fine. They are players that have lived through a lot of big moments and have a big experience so it can only be beneficial for me.’ Mangala joins his former Porto teammate Fernando at the Etihad after the Brazilian midfielder moved for £12m earlier this summer. He also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He added: ‘I was with Bacary Sagna during the World Cup so we had the opportunity to talk. There are quite a lot of French players and Fernando, who I was in touch during all the preparation because I came here earlier. ‘I had the chance to talk with him and there are some players that speak Spanish and I understand a bit of that language so I think it will be quite quick for me to settle in. The most important thing is to have a good understanding on the pitch and to all go in the same direction.’",

        "document": "(CNN) --   Much has been made of the electric car driving to the rescue of ailing automobile manufacturers and saving the planet at the same time. But what if that eco-savior came on two wheels instead of four? Lean, green electric machine: KLD is hoping to kickstart the electric scooter industry with its new engine. A high price tag, a limited range, sluggish performance and the tendency not to work when they get wet, have meant that electric scooters are a rare sight on the roads. However, KLD Energy Technologies, an electric engine company based in Texas, believes that its new electric motor can overcome all these problems and kick-start the sector. It's teaming up with Vietnamese motorbike manufacturer Sufat to produce an affordable electric-powered scooter that has a performance just as good as a normal petrol-powered bike. \"We chose Vietnam [to launch the bike] because there are 22 million scooters in a country of 85 million people. That's a lot of people riding scooters in a contained area and the pollution is a concern. All governments in southeast Asia are looking for solutions [to pollution problems], but so far there hasn't been one. We believe that we've found that solution,\" Christian Okonsky, founder of KLD Energy Technologies told CNN. Rather than looking at making batteries more efficient, KLD has improved the performance of the engine itself. The company has built an engine using nano-crystalline composite materials, which it believes is 10 times more efficient than traditional iron core motors, giving an output of 2500 hertz. Together with a computerized motor control, the KLD engine is compatible with any type of battery. Top speed of the KLD scooter is about 55 mph, which is almost double that of many electric scooters and delivers twice as much torque, accelerating from 0 to 50 mph in ten seconds. The engine also doesn't require a transmission. The range on a full charge depends on the type of battery used, although in tests KLD says that its motor system extends the distance a battery can go before a charge is required by 40 percent. Cost-efficiency of components and years of technological development have created the engine KLD has the sole license to produce. \"The nano-crystalline material was developed 20 years ago, but it was incredibly expensive and people couldn't figure out how to use it in a motor. Even 10 years ago a computer, to run this kind of high frequency engine, would have been more like the size of a desk top computer. The magnets we use today that cost 20 cents 10 years ago would have cost $4 to $5,\" said Okonsky. Vectrix Electrics is another company that has been developing electric scooters, so far selling only in North America and Europe. While the performance of its scooters is comparable to KLD's, their models sell at a much higher price tag around $11,000. Earlier this month Vectrix reported financial difficulties and has been forced to make staff cuts. Okonsky, however, remains positive that the KLD scooter engine will be successful and that there is a market for electric-powered scooters. By the end of the year KLD is aiming for 2,000 scooters a month to be produced by Sufat with its electric engine. The projected retail price is around $1500, only slightly more than Sufat's existing bikes that sell in Vietnam for between $800 and $1250. \"Among two-wheelers a scooter is the best for electric drive,\" auto industry analyst John Wormald of Autopolis told CNN. \"A motorcycle is too performance-driven, so it's not really suitable, but a scooter would be. For many electric bikes with very limited battery capacity, the power is just an assist and the battery can be heavy which isn't great, if you're cycling.\" Yet the market for electric bikes -- the pedal variety with a battery pack -- has been booming, particularly in China. According to the China Bicycle Association, sales of electric bikes in China stood at 58,000 in 1998, compared with the 20 million recorded just a decade later in 2008.  Watch the report on electric bikes ». However, rather than replacing cars, the majority of electric bikes are affordable substitutions for bicycles, as Chinese cities continue to grow and daily commutes get longer. Their impact in reducing pollution then is open to question, as car sales in the country continue to rise. Ultimately the real eco-credentials of electric vehicles depends on how the electricity is generated, but for helping to relieve vehicle exhaust-filled streets, especially in Asia's two-wheel dominated city centers, electric mopeds could go a long way. As the idea of electric vehicles as viable substitutions for petrol-powered ones becomes more widely accepted, Okonsky's bigger challenge will be convincing skeptics that the old problems of electric scooters have been overcome. \"I'm always asked, 'What happens if I go through a puddle, will it still work?' The answer is yes,\" Okonsky said. In fact, Okonsky says that they've tested their engine underwater and it still works. Expect a video of the trial on KLD's Web site soon.",

        "document": "A Texas appeals court on Thursday overturned a judge's ruling that had voided the marriage of a transgender widow whose firefighter husband died battling a blaze. The 13th Texas Court of Appeals sent the case of Nikki Araguz back to the lower court, saying 'there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding [Araguz's] sex and whether the marriage was a same sex marriage.' In 2011, state District Judge Randy Clapp in Wharton County ruled that the marriage between Nikki Araguz and her husband Thomas Araguz was 'void as a matter of law.' Victory: An appeals court has overturned a decision that voided Nikki Araguz's marriage to her first husband Thomas Delgado because she was born male . Thomas Araguz's mother and his first wife Heather Delgado had challenged the marriage's validity, arguing the fallen firefighter's estate should go to his two sons because Nikki Araguz was born a man and Texas does not recognize same-sex marriage. Attorneys for Delgado called the appeals court an 'activist court' relying on 'junk science' after the ruling. Nikki Araguz, 38, had argued in court she had done everything medically and legally possible to show she is female and was legally married under Texas law and that she's entitled to widow's benefits. 'It’s never been about the money for me.' Nicki said as she celebrated the court ruling with supporters Thursday night. 'If I would have stayed quiet, the only narrative anyone would have heard was that I was a trickin' tranny who lied to my husband.' Honest and loving: Nikki Araguz says her first husband was fully aware of transgender journey . Marriage: Nikki Araguz pictured with her first husband on their wedding day in 2008 . At a press conference Friday, attorney for Delgado Ted Burwell demurred. 'Whenever someone says it’s not about the money, you know what it’s about,' he said. The battle is over $635,000 in death benefits that the widow of a firefighter is entitled to. However, there is potentially millions more at stake. A lawsuit alleging a faulty light was responsible for the 2010 blaze which killed Thomas Araguz could result in millions in damages. Kent Rutter, Nikki Araguz's attorney, said his client was very pleased by Thursday's ruling. 'This decision recognizes that transgender Texans have the right to marry the person that they love,' he said. Araguz has remarried since her first husband's death. Second time around: Araguz has since remarried, to William Loyd . Attorneys for Simona Longoria, Thomas Araguz's mother, and Delgado, his ex-wife, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Longoria and her family have said Thomas Araguz learned of his wife's gender history just before his death and had planned to end the marriage. But Nikki Araguz, who remarried in 2013, has insisted Thomas Araguz fully supported her through the surgical process to become a woman. She underwent surgery two months after they were married in 2008. Thomas Araguz died July 2010 while fighting a fire at an egg farm near Wharton, located 60 miles southwest of Houston. He was 30. In its 26-page ruling, the three-judge panel of the Corpus Christi-based appeals court wrote that Clapp erred by essentially saying in his ruling that Nikki Araguz was a man at the time of her husband's death. Equal love: William Loyd (left) escorts fiancee Nikki Araguz and daughter Charlotte Loyd, nine, from Nueces County Courthouse Thursday, September 18, 2013 after Araguz's first hearing. The couple married outside the court minutes later . Marriage equality: Attorneys against Nikki Araguz described the appeals court as an 'activist court' relying on 'junk science' 'I fully expect the other side to fight back as hate mongers often do,' said Nikki Araguz said Thursday.Burwell said that hate was not an issue in the case. 'To construe that anyone is hate mongering is Nikki is just grandstanding,' said Burwell. Attorneys for Longoria and Delgado had argued Nikki Araguz was born with male sex organs and had such organs at the time of her marriage, making it invalid. Widow: Araguz stands to collect $635,000 in benefits and possibly millions more for the death of her firefighter husband . The appeals court said more expert testimony on this issue is needed as the only such testimony presented was an affidavit by one of Nikki Araguz's doctors, who wrote that she was medically and psychologically female as a result of her compliance with the standards of care adopted by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health. The three-judge panel also wrote that changes made in 2009 to the Texas Family Code that allowed transgendered people to use proof of their sex change to get a marriage license legislatively overruled a previous court decision that had been used as legal precedent in such cases. In that 1999 case, a San Antonio woman's wrongful-death claim brought on behalf of her husband was thrown out, with a court ruling that although the woman had undergone a sex-change operation, she was actually a man, based on her original birth certificate.",

        "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Debates are a campaign's restart button. Voters try to erase their preconceptions and examine the candidates face-to-face, equal and unscripted -- which is why a challenger, particularly one who's running behind, is eager to have as many debates as possible. Voters said John Kerry won the debates in 2004 but they liked George W. Bush better and he won a second term. \"Let's meet every week from now until the election and talk about the real issues facing Americans.'' That was John Kerry to U.S. President George W. Bush in August 2004. Republican John McCain issued the same challenge to Democratic Barack Obama this summer, when Obama was the frontrunner in the polls. This year there's three debates between the presidential candidates -- September 26 in Mississippi; October 7 in Tennessee and October 15 in New York state. Debates are valuable because they provide most of the spontaneous moments in the campaign. Everything else is staged -- the rallies, the television ads, the conventions. But debates, which are organized by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, are unscripted. The candidates do not know the questions in advance. How do they prepare? Debate coaches grill them. They ask them tough questions on every subject likely to come up. They even coach the candidates on \"body language,'' such as how to invade an opponent's space in order to appear dominant.  Watch a preview of the upcoming presidential debate » . In every election since 1952 -- until this year -- either the president has run for re-election (like George W. Bush in 2004) or the vice president has run to succeed him (like Al Gore in 2000). Debates give the challenger a chance to close the stature gap with the president or the vice president. And to make the election a referendum on the incumbent president. In 1960, John F. Kennedy, who was challenging Vice President Richard Nixon, played to concerns that the U.S. was losing its competitive edge against the Soviet Union. \"Are our strength and prestige rising?\" Kennedy asked in a debate. \"Do people want to be identified with us?\" The 1980 race was very much in doubt when challenger Ronald Reagan went into his one and only debate with President Jimmy Carter one week before Election Day. Reagan's hard-line image frightened many voters. He used the debate to reassure them that he wasn't a dangerous man. And to frame the election as a referendum on his opponent. \"Ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?'' Reagan said in his closing statement. \"Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?'' Debates often provide revealing moments. Like when President Gerald Ford prematurely liberated Eastern Europe at a 1976 debate. \"The United States does not concede that these countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union,'' the president said, making specific reference to Poland, Yugoslavia and Romania. In 1988, Michael Dukakis gave a dispassionate response when asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. \"I've opposed the death penalty all of my life,'' Dukakis replied. \"I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent.'' In 1992, the first President Bush was criticized for being out of touch with ordinary Americans. That perception was reinforced during a debate when the camera caught the president looking at his watch as he took questions from voters. One voter asked about the consequences of the national debt. \"I'm not sure I get it,'' President Bush responded. The challenger got it. \"Tell me how [the debt] has affected you?'' Bill Clinton responded. \"Do you know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?'' In 2000, Al Gore may have won more debating points. But the camera caught Gore theatrically sighing while George W. Bush answered questions. Voters liked Bush better. And that's what counted. Similarly in 2004, when CNN polled viewers after each debate, the prevailing view was that Kerry won. Voters concluded Kerry was a better debater than Bush. But that didn't get Kerry many votes. Voters decide how to vote based on many qualities, not just debating skills. The prize for winning a debate is not winning the election. What debates really do is keep the race open. Many voters say: \"I'm going to hit the restart button, clear the screen and watch the debates with an open mind. Then I'll decide how to vote.''",

The billionaire father of Linda Evangelista's baby wanted her to abort their son, her lawyer has claimed as the supermodel meets her former boyfriend in court over childcare support. And taking the stand, François-Henri Pinault admitted he had broken up with the supermodel after discovering she was pregnant four months into their relationship. 'I didn't even know . her,' he said. The bitter trial, which kicked off on Thursday and is expected to last four days, is set to spell out the childcare obligations of Pinault, who is now married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek. Evangelista gave birth to their son Augie, now five, after her short relationship with Pinault, and has claimed in the run-up to the trial that she wants a staggering $46,000 a month for his care. Ready for business: Linda Evangelista arrives at a Manhattan court to thrash out a childcare support deal with her former partner, French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, for their son Augie . Battle: Evangelista has previously said she wants $46,000 a month in child support for the five-year-old . She claimed the vast sum is to cover the youngster's around-the-clock nanny, at a cost of $7,000 a month, and armed drivers, costing as much as $16,000 a month, the New York Post reported. Pinault had criticised Evangelista for her outlandish demands, suggesting the money was in fact for 'mom support'; she maintained she was modelling or working on her image at all hours of the day. In a move that shows they are readying for a bitter feud, Evangelista's lawyer William Beslow recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006. 'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate. Attention: The model drew a scrum of photographers to the family court hearing in Manhattan . Surrounded: Ms Evangelista and her lawyer fought through the press pack on their way in to court . In court: Evangelista, seen undergoing a security check in the Manhattan court, claims she needs the large sum to cover around-the-clock nannies and armed drivers . Evangelista, who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby, the Post reported. 'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.' Arriving at court, Evangelista, 46, looked ready for business, dressed in a smart floral-print shirt, knee-length black skirt and sunglasses, with her hair cut into a sleek bob. Pinault, who began dating Hayak while Evangelista was pregnant, watched his former girlfriend with a bemused smile, the Post reported. As he took the witness stand, Pinault said he found out she was pregnant in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news. 'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' Hectic: Evangelista was spotted out with her son Augie, right, ahead of the court appearance . Motherly love: In court, Augie's father said he broke up with Evangelista when he found out she was pregnant . He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.' He went on to say he believed she had intentionally become pregnant and that he had no part in deciding whether she should keep the baby or not. He added: 'I told her I would recognize the baby, which I did. I would take my responsibility and I did.' Asked why he didn’t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn’t ask and I didn’t offer.' The 49-year-old is chief executive of PPR, . the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta. He has an annual income is heir to an $11.5 billion family estate. In opening statements on . Thursday, Beslow insisted Evangelista is not hoping to improve her . station in life but that she has paid all of his expenses without a . single cent from Pinault. 'Ms. Evangelista is not looking to piggyback on the lifestyle of Mr. Pinault,' Beslow added. 'She is looking for a continuation of the . reasonable lifestyle of Augie.' Happier times: Evangelista dated French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault for four months at the end of 2005 . Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court . Pinault's . lawyer, David Aronson, argued that his client had repeatedly reach out . to Evangelista's prior lawyers about child support payments, only to be . met with silence. He added: 'Most of the expenses do not relate to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista.' He . continued: 'These people have more money than a lot of people. But our . position is that what we understand is being asked for is just . ridiculous.' Evangelista is . due to testify in the trial tomorrow. If she is granted the $46,000 of . her demands, it will shatter records for childcare payouts. 'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February. Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked. 'When I work, it can be a 16-hour . day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am . working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I . have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an . athlete.' Moving on: Pinault began dating Salma Hayek, left, when Evangelista was pregnant. Evangelista says her son should get the same trust fund as Hayek and Pinault's daughter Valentina, right . Evangelista, herself worth $8 million, is also demanding Pinault give her . son a home similar to the $13 million California mansion he put in a . trust for his and Hayek's four-year-old daughter, Valentina. His family estate includes the . Christie’s auction house, the Château-Latour vineyard in Bordeaux and . the French premiere league football team Stade Rennais, the Daily News . reported. Earlier this week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder . said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely. He pointed out that judges . consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth . of the parents. 'She’s in for a big surprise. I wouldn’t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News. She is worth $8 million and owns a . penthouse in the desirable Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her . son’s school on the upper East Side. Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots . She . broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton . last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up. Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed. The couple dated from . September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when . Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009. Evangelista had kept the name of Augie's father secret until it was written in court papers filed in August.",

        "document": "Washington (CNN) -- The National Security Agency spent Friday on the defensive, after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules \"thousands of times each year\" since 2008. The audit was first reported by the Washington Post on Thursday, setting off another round of heated discussion -- and criticism -- in Washington over how the NSA had wrongly impinged on Americans' privacy. \"I ... will continue to demand honest and forthright answers from the intelligence community,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, noting the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs will hold a hearing on the Post's revelations. \"I remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the NSA.\" In a call with reporters Friday, John DeLong -- the NSA's director of compliance -- acknowledged \"mistakes occur,\" even as he insisted only a \"tiny\" amount of such problems were intentional. \"No one at NSA thinks a mistake is OK,\" DeLong said several times in the call, which a spokesman said was conducted to \"address inaccuracies.\" NSA leaker Edward Snowden -- whose ongoing leaks have riled the Obama administration and intelligence community -- provided the material to the Post earlier this summer. The May 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of \"unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications\" in the preceding 12 months, the Post reported in its story. \"Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure,\" said the Post article by reporter Barton Gellman. \"The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.\" Leahy was not the only lawmaker, nor the only member of President Barack Obama's Democratic party, to call for more oversight and hearings. \"Press reports that the National Security Agency broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi called for \"rigorous oversight\" by Congress on the \"incidents of non-compliance.\" Another Democrat from California, Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, told the Post in a statement late Thursday night that her committee \"can and should do more to independently verify that NSA's operations are appropriate, and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate.\" The Washington Post reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country. In one case, the NSA decided it didn't need to report the unintended surveillance. In 2008, a \"large number\" of calls placed from Washington were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol's 202 area code for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt. The information came from a \"quality assurance\" review that wasn't distributed to the NSA overnight staff, according to the Post. Separately, an NSA new collection method went undiscovered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for months. The court, which has authority over some of the agency's operations, ruled it unconstitutional. Responding to the Post's story, the NSA said, \"A variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next.\" Factors can include implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes and expanded access. \"The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent, dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment, implement mitigation measures wherever possible, and drive the numbers down,\" the agency said. The agency released another statement Thursday night defending its programs. \"NSA's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally,\" it said. \"When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it.\" On Friday, DeLong said his agency \"detects and corrects mistakes\" as these occur and are identified, which stops them from being \"propagated.\" \"The NSA has zero tolerance for misconduct,\" he said, noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases. Overall, DeLong insisted, the NSA carefully adheres to privacy protections. White House spokesman Josh Earnest offered a similar statement Friday, saying the NSA compliance office's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people's privacy. \"The documents demonstrate that the NSA is monitoring, detecting, addressing and reporting compliance incidents,\" Earnest said. The man who leaked the audit to the Post, Snowden, stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. Snowden fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. NSA: We read .00004% of Web traffic . Although polling shows Americans harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs Snowden revealed, a majority of Americans don't approve of the actions he took and they think he, as an American citizen, should be brought to justice. A CNN/ORC International survey released last month indicated that 52% of the public disapproved of Snowden's actions, while 44% said they approved of the leaks. Fifty-four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring Snowden back to the United States and prosecute him for his leaks. As for the program Snowden revealed, there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics, with younger Americans more likely to support Snowden than older Americans. CNN's Lesa Jansen and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

        "document": "A devoted grandmother died from cervical cancer after her GP repeatedly dismissed her symptoms as the menopause. Cheryl Humpage, 55, died in July 2010 after huge tumours spread - despite her undergoing an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Almost 18 months earlier in February 2008, the grandmother-of-three and former factory worker sought medical help after complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever. Her GP, Dr Martin Crowther, of St Peter's Surgery in Walsall, West Midlands, dismissed her symptoms as the menopause and she was prescribed HRT. Cheryl Humpage saw her GP several times complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer.  By the time she was diagnosed, it was too late to save her . February 15, 2008 - Mrs Humpage first visited her GP complaining of fever, vomiting and aching. He gave her painkillers and suggested it was probably the menopause. February 22, 2008 - She returned to the GP as her symptoms had not improved. He offered a course of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) but she did not want it. September 2008 - Mrs Humpage had been experiencing having heavy bleeding so went back to see the GP again. This time he prescribed HRT. February 23, 2009 - After another visit, she was finally referred for a scan at Walsall Manor Hospital. March 5, 2009 - Mrs Humpage underwent an ultrasound which highlighted a large tumour on her ovary. She was admitted to City hospital as an emergency. April 19, 2009 - The primary cancer is found to be on her cervix and she is referred for chemotherapy . July 26, 2010 - Mrs Humpage dies aged 55. But her symptoms persisted and despite being examined by Dr Crowther a further three times, she was not diagnosed with cancer until a year later. In March 2009, doctors finally diagnosed her with cancer after she was referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital but it was too late to save her and she died four months later. Today her devastated husband Peter, 56, received a five-figure compensation pay-out from the GP's insurers after suing Dr Crowther for medical negligence. Mr Humpage said: 'Cheryl was very concerned about her symptoms but she thought she was in safe hands. 'She was a great mum and grandmother and very family orientated, we're all absolutely heartbroken that she's no longer with us. 'It's very hard not to be angry about what happened. Cheryl should not have had to suffer like she did and if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier we believe we could have had longer with her. 'We just hope that what happened to Cheryl acts as a reminder to all of us about the importance of a quick diagnosis of cervical cancer. 'It is however still difficult to come to terms with out loss because we have never had any sort of apology or admission of responsibility to help us draw a line under everything that happened. 'Until then, I'm not sure that we can ever truly move forward.' Dr Crowther today apologised for failing to detect Mrs Humpage's cancer. He said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to Mrs Humpage's family for their loss. 'I am sorry for the delay in making a diagnosis. I . have reflected extensively on the episode and discussed it with . colleagues and I have learned from this process, now being more aware of . the danger in similar situations.' A year after Mrs Humpage's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital (pictured), where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer . Lindsay Tomlinson, from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who represented the family, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife, mother and grandmother. 'During out investigations an independent medical expert found that Cheryl's GP should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers. 'Any yet no pelvic examination was made, she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue. 'Had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family.' Ms Tomlinson added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier, her suffering would have been 'greatly reduced and it was 'incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly'. About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK and it is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45. The symptoms of aren't always obvious and the disease may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage. In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. Its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated. Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine. If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain, a loss of appetite and a lack of energy. Because of routine screening in the UK it is usually picked up in the precancerous stage. Therefore it is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years. Women aged between 50 and 64 are offered screening every five years.",

        "document": "By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 20:31 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:31 EST, 28 October 2013 . Swaddling may have come back into fashion, particularly after speculation over how Prince George appeared to be wrapped as he left hospital. But the centuries-old practice could damage a baby’s hips, a British surgeon warns. Swaddling has become popular again because of its perceived calming effect, after falling out of favour following concern that it could overheat the baby and restrict growth. Swaddling may have come back into fashion after speculation Prince George was wrapped as he left hospital . Demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two-thirds in the UK in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of Prince George in his mother’s arms – although there is no evidence he was fully swaddled. In the US, nine in ten babies are swaddled in the first six months. But Professor Nicholas Clarke of Southampton University Hospital says there is growing evidence that it can lead to hip abnormalities. Professor Clarke, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon, said binding or bundling babies in blankets with the arms restrained and the lower limbs extended may force the hips to straighten and shift forward, risking misalignment which could lead to osteoarthritis and hip replacement in middle age, or even dislocation. In Japan a programme to encourage grandmothers not to swaddle their grandchildren has halved the rate of hip dislocation. One baby in five is born with a hip abnormality but factors after birth also have a role and swaddling may delay improvement, Professor Clarke said in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. He said swaddling can be safe if it does not stop the baby’s legs from bending up and out at the hips, because this position allows for natural development of the hip joints. Demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two-thirds in the UK in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of Prince George in his mother's arms . ‘Commercial products for swaddling should have a loose pouch or sack for the babies’ legs and feet, allowing plenty of hip movement,’ he said, adding that healthcare professionals need to give mothers advice about how to swaddle their children safely, so their legs are not tightly wrapped and pressed together. Jane Munro of the Royal College of Midwives said: ‘There are concerns about the growing use of swaddling because of the possibility of overheating the baby, and the increased risk of cot death. Also, as this research suggests, swaddling, and especially tight swaddling, may affect the baby’s natural posture. ‘We advise parents to avoid swaddling, but it is also crucial that we take into account each mother’s cultural background.’ Andreas Roposch, from Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘Swaddling should not be employed in my view.’ Dr Alastair Sutcliffe of the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said: ‘I would advise that if a baby needs to be wrapped up to get off to sleep that parents do this in a sympathetic and loose manner and not tight, especially around the baby’s hips.’",

        "document": "(CNN) -- It's New Year's Eve, and you're parked in front of your television with a bottle of stale champagne, watching the ball drop ... again. Wouldn't you rather be cruising the open seas or riding a roller coaster? We thought so. Start the New Year off right doing something extraordinary. Sure, you might have already exceeded your holiday budget, but plan ahead so next year isn't so predictable. Relaxing cruise . Standing around in the freezing cold waiting for the ball to drop is so last year. Book a cruise and start the year feeling warm, cheerful and relaxed. Holland America Line books holiday cruises to the Caribbean, Mexico and Hawaii, among other destinations. Trips can range anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, and you won't have to worry about finding a ride home or navigating the crowds in Times Square. If you're on a Royal Caribbean cruise for the holiday, there is a themed party for adults and separate New Year's Eve parties for teens and kids. You'll miss out on fireworks, but the all-you-can-eat appetizers will more than make up for it. Amusement park . If you're going to be cheering or shouting at midnight anyway, you might as well be at the top of a roller coaster. Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio is open from 2 p.m. to 1 a.m. on New Year's Eve, with the park transformed into a winter wonderland for the Holiday in the Park event. While surrounded by thousands of colorful holiday lights, patrons can enjoy live entertainment and festive treats, in between riding roller coasters. Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in the San Francisco Bay Area will also be open late on New Year's Eve, from 4 p.m. to midnight, though rides close at 11:30 p.m. The celebration will feature family sledding, dance parties, live music and fireworks. And like Fiesta Texas, Discovery Kingdom will also be hosting Holiday in the Park. Peaceful meditation . Want a little more \"om\" in the New Year? Meditating your way to 2011 might be the way to do it. To enter January feeling fully renewed, embark on a four-day yoga retreat to Sedona, Arizona. On New Year's Eve, participants journal about the year's gains and losses, share intimacies with one another and partake in silent group meditation. For those in New York who have seen the ball drop one too many times, the Chakrasambara Kadampa Meditation Center and the Vishwa Dharma Mandalam will offer guided meditation and devotional mantra chanting, respectively, at the end of 2010. Winter fun . Though known best for its immaculate skiing, Vail, Colorado, has many options for other winter fun on New Year's Eve. Start the day off skiing at Vail Mountain, which has 31 lifts, three terrain parks and 193 trails. The park is open from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and has chic lodges for hot drinks and snacks après-ski. Ice skating at Vail Square in Lionshead Village is another way to enjoy winter weather. The space is surrounded by fire pits, boutiques, galleries and cafes. Move over to Golden Peak Village at 6:15 p.m. for the torchlight parade, holiday music and fireworks on the mountains -- a snowy way to ring in the New Year. Swanky gala . If you're set on getting all decked out for the New Year, Washington D.C.'s Gala is the place to be. The event is held at the Wardman Park Marriott Hotel and offers eight different cultural celebrations spanning seven ballrooms. Featured cultures are New York City, Russia, Cuba, Ireland, China, New Orleans, Jamaica and Italy. Tickets range from $109 to $239, depending on the package you select. To really go all out, the Imperial Ball at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna is selling tickets for 570 Euros (about $750) that include a four-course dinner, a welcome cocktail, red and white wines, champagne and seat reservation. Plus, you'll be ringing in the New Year with the imperial court.",

        "document": "Swine flu may be inspiring fear worldwide, but for Stephan Zielinski of San Francisco, California, it inspired a song. The genes underlying swine flu inspired one amateur musician to compose music based on it. The virus has the classification H1N1 because it includes two key viral proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Zielinski took the genetic sequence of a variant of hemagglutinin and created a computer algorithm to turn it into music. Zielinski, 41, is not a biochemist or a professional musician -- he's a writer, photographer, computer programmer, and blogger who creates music in his spare time. But he's fascinated that, even though biologists can map the genome of the virus and predict what the hemagglutinin protein looks like, the human body still cannot distinguish it as the \"bad guy\" -- at least, not until there's a vaccine. Listen to the song . \"Although the map is there and you can even make a song out of it, we can't explain it to these itty bitty little cells in body,\" he said. Using computer programs he created himself, as well as a commercial product, Zielinski composed his song by assigning instruments and musical notes to various properties of the protein. Zielinski took the various categories of amino acids, the building blocks of the protein, and assigned each a different instrument -- piano, organ, low synthesizer, percussion. The melody was created by assigning notes to specific amino acids. Each beat of the song also corresponds to one of numerous amino acids. The work was done entirely with a computer and took about six hours Tuesday, he said.  Learn more about swine flu » . He first learned of the sequence through an immunologist friend at the Mayo Clinic, he said. Zielinski saw it as a form of highly organized information that a human did not design. \"The only way I could look at that and make sense of it, since I'm not a biochemist, was, well, I could try translating it into another very organized form of information that people do, and then see if I could hear anything. And the answer, of course, turned out to be no.\" But even if the mystery of the virus did not reveal itself in musical form, the result is a curiously melodic, innovative, somewhat soothing work. Dr. Jay Steinberg, infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, called it \"nice ambient music\" that's reminiscent of Brian Eno. Less methodical swine flu songs are also emerging on YouTube. User \"CelicaAaron\" parodies the Jonas Brothers' song \"Lovebug,\" crooning, \"I can't get your snout out of my mouth / I'm sick to my stomach all the time.\" A short spoken-word effort by user \"Micfri\" warns, \"You know who has swine flu?

Eleven of the arrests were in Italy, in the northern cities of Milan, Reggio Emilia, Bergamo, and San Remo, said. Lt. Col. Sandro Sandulli, the head of the Carabinieri special forces. One was already in custody, so authorities served him with a new arrest warrant which included new charges against him, Sandulli said. Three arrests were in Britain, one in France, and one in Portugal, Sandulli said. The remaining arrests happened in European countries but Sandulli did not specify which ones. Those arrested are suspected of forming Salafi Jihad terrorist cells which were recruiting suicide bombers and sending them to Iraq and Afghanistan, said Col. Mario Parente, deputy commander of the Carabinieri special forces unit. Parente said that during the arrests, police found al Qaeda manuals for the production of explosives, detonation devices, and various poisons. He said the manuals also included details of guerrilla-style war operations. Salafi is an extreme school of Islamic thought which developed in Egypt and began to have prominence with militant groups there in the late 1960s and has since been adopted by terrorist groups in North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, said Sajjan Gohel, director of international security at the Asia Pacific Foundation in London. \"It's become the ideology of choice for transnational terrorism, including al Qaeda,\" Gohel said. \"It's emerging as a very dangerous ideology.\" The Madrid train bombers and various terrorist cells in Italy were part of the Salafi school of thought, he added. Italian police said Tuesday's arrests were the result of an investigation, started in 2003, into some Salafi cells which were organized by Tunisians and Algerians. The main suspect in the operation is a Tunisian who was arrested in 2002 during a separate antiterrorism operation, police said. The main terrorist cell was based in the northern Italian region of Lombardy and involved what investigators called a \"long-term\" jihadist program which provided military and ideological training. Another cell, based in Reggio Emilia, had the goal of creating a grand Islamic \"empire\" stretching from Morocco to China, police said.

        "document": "Washington (CNN) -- A group of pro-Hillary Clinton super PACs had it all figured out a few months ago: One would handle the email list, another the rapid response and another would spearhead the big-dollar fundraising. Strategists touted their cohesion and efficiency, two attributes they admitted were not usually applied to Democratic groups. But the excitement they created around a possible presidential bid had a somewhat unintended byproduct when a few eager and ambitious young politicos with no connection to Clinton or her aides realized that they, too, could get in on the early organizing game by starting their own super PACs. So that's what they did. And while these organizers feel they are just adding their voice to the chorus of pro-Clinton groups, representatives from those PACs with longstanding ties to the former first lady and secretary of state see the new entries as an uncontrollable variable. Inside Politics: Rubio gives Clinton an 'F' as secretary of state . And these organizers feel that could siphon attention from other efforts to get Clinton to run. Right now, there are at least eight pro-Clinton super PACs registered with the Federal Election Commission. The highest-profile groups -- Ready for Hillary, American Bridge and Correct the Record -- have deep connections to the Clintons and are staffed by longtime confidants who regularly attend Clinton events and receptions. But then there are the unaffiliated groups -- Hillary 2016, Hillary Clinton Super PAC, Hillary FTW, Hillary PAC, Madam Hillary 2016 and more. Not only are these unaffiliated groups created out of the excitement stirred by the larger PACs, but they are also, in some ways, copying the message that is working. Making strategic sense . \"I entirely believe that with so much support from so many young politicos, this is really shining a light at the importance of young progressives,\" said Eric Williams, the co-founder of Hillary 2016 PAC, who has zero ties to Clinton-land. \"We like her and I feel like that is going to encourage her decision.\" That grassroots mission statement is similar to what Ready for Hillary founders said when in 2013, strategists talked about getting young progressives so excited that their enthusiasm would compel Clinton to run. And the similarities aren't lost on the more established groups. Clintons in Oxford for Chelsea's graduation . \"A bottom-up effort like Ready for Hillary won't discourage any grassroots supporters from expressing their enthusiasm or organizing,\" said a person familiar with Ready for Hillary's view of other super PACs. \"At the same time, it makes more sense strategically to have one vehicle and build one massive list of supporters, because that's what will put Hillary in the strongest position possible should she decide to run.\" The issue isn't that these groups are stepping on fundraising toes. Since organizing earlier this year, Hillary 2016 has gained fewer than 100 followers on Twitter and has raised a total of $0, according to the group. Despite that start, Williams says they will bank a decent amount after their first fundraiser in June and plan to have one each month after that. His attitude is that you have to start somewhere and his PAC is in the beginning of the building process. By comparison, Ready for Hillary has raised nearly $6 million from more than 55,000 donors since organizing in early 2013. While many of these donors come from small, grassroots events that cost $20.16 (get it?) to attend, a number have been high-profile Clinton supporters and confidants. The group has also begun moving into the endorsement game, securing Clinton support from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia in the past week. 'We kind of roll our eyes' when another super PAC emerges . That hasn't stopped some from worrying, though. \"Legitimately, I can understand why it concerns people,\" said a source close to a pro-Clinton super PAC who asked not to be identified in order to speak more candidly. \"We don't know who these people are. ... The good thing about Ready for Hillary is they channel all the excitement. It seems to me it would be more beneficial to have Ready for Hillary be the mother ship.\" The source added, \"We kind of roll our eyes every time we see a new super PAC has filed.\" Representatives from Ready for Hillary said they have not yet reached out to the founders of Hillary 2016 PAC. In the past, the group has reached out to other pro-Clinton super PACs to talk about possibly working together. Williams said that he didn't start the group to get pulled into Ready for Hillary because he wants to lead his own organization. \"We all have different political idea and idea for political success,\" Williams added in an apparent knock on Ready for Hillary. Biden takes shot at Clinton White House . \"To be honest with you, I don't think I expect it,\" Williams added about meeting with Ready for Hillary. \"It wasn't an expectation of mine.\" The concern among the super PACs close to Clinton is twofold. One, they worry that these groups will make mistakes and muddy what they had hoped would be a clean and efficient effort. Even if these groups are small, they say, their impact on that front could be outsized. \"Anyone can start one of these organizations and raise money and then eventually, if they are successful, start running ads,\" said Alan Abramowitz, an except on super PACs and campaign finance laws. \"Having these super PACs support you is a double edged sward. ... The problem is that you can't control their message, so someone could go out there and start running ads who thinks they are helping Hillary Clinton, even though she might not like the message.\" Secondly, some representatives from organization's closer to Clinton also question the motives of the smaller groups, especially the idea that starting a super PAC is a way to get possible get a job with a hypothetical presidential campaign. Angling for campaign jobs? Representatives for Hillary 2016 PAC played coy about whether they would want campaign jobs. \"At this current moment, that is not an interest of ours,\" Williams said when the group launched in April, pausing before he added this caveat: \"But of course we are always open to anything. Times change and things change.\" Not all agree that the proliferation of pro-Clinton groups is a bad thing, though. To some, including Burns Strider, a senior adviser to Correct the Record, the process is \"healthy and uniquely \"American.\" \"As long as Americans are looking to support her and promote her and encourage her, that is a great thing,\" Strider said. He added, however, this caveat: \"When all of this filters out, the pretenders will be outed and they will be out of the way and those who are for real will be there to the bitter end.

        "document": "The House of Representatives voted Thursday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over documents tied to the botched Fast and Furious gun-running sting -- a discredited operation that has become a sharp point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. The House approved a pair of criminal and civil measures against the attorney general, marking the first time in American history that the head of the Justice Department has been held in contempt by Congress. House members approved the criminal contempt measure in a 255-67 vote.  Almost every House Republican backed the measure, along with 17 Democrats.   Shortly thereafter, the civil measure passed in a sharply polarized 258-95 vote. A large number of Democrats -- including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- walked off the House floor in protest and refused to participate in the criminal contempt vote.  A slightly smaller number of Democrats appeared to boycott the vote on the civil measure as well. Speaking in New Orleans, Holder dismissed the House action as \"the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided -- and politically motivated -- investigation during an election year.\"  In a written statement, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer blasted congressional Republicans for pushing \"political theater rather than legitimate congressional oversight.\" The criminal contempt charge refers the dispute to District of Columbia U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, who will decide whether to file charges against Holder.  Most legal analysts do not expect Machen -- an Obama appointee who ultimately answers to Holder -- to take any action. The civil measure allows the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to file a lawsuit asking the courts to examine the Justice Department's failure to produce certain subpoenaed documents, as well as the validity of the administration's recent assertion of executive privilege over the documents in question. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history . Legal experts contacted by CNN have said, based on recent precedent, that it could take years for the courts to reach any final decision in the civil case. Fast and Furious, a so-called \"gun-walking\" operation, allowed roughly 2,000 guns into Mexico with the goal of tracking them to Mexican drug cartels. Two guns found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's fatal shooting were linked to the operation. Guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of Mexican civilians' deaths. GOP leaders say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances surrounding Terry's death.  Democrats insist the Republican-led probe is all about politics.  Thursday's vote came two days after House Republicans rejected the latest offer by the White House and Justice Department to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators in exchange for dropping the contempt measures. A senior House Republican aide told CNN the offer was insufficient. In the hours leading up to the criminal contempt vote, Republicans repeatedly insisted that they were exercising proper legislative oversight of the executive branch and seeking answers for Terry's family. \"In the real world Americans are expected to comply with subpoenas.  Is the attorney general any different?  No he is not,\" said Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida.  \"The attorney general can stonewall all he wants.  The attorney general can misremember all he wants.  But whether he likes it or not, today responsibility will land on his desk.\" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned that \"even the attorney general cannot evade the law.  (It's) time for America to find out the truth. ... (It's) time for a little transparency.  Today is judgment day.  That's just the way it is.\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the \"House needs to know how this happened, and it's our constitutional duty to find out. ... No Justice Department is above the law, and no Justice Department is above the Constitution.\" Democrats accused Republicans of playing political games with an operation that leaders on both sides of the aisle concede was a mistake. \"What the Republicans are doing with this motion ... is contemptible,\" Pelosi declared.  \"This is something that makes a witch hunt look like a day at the beach.  It is (the) railroading of a resolution that is unsubstantiated by the facts, based on a false premise.\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, complained that \"every single attempt for even-handed investigation has been thwarted by the Republican majority.\"  Holder is \"a good, decent, honorable man.  He's doing an excellent job as attorney general.  He does not deserve this.\" Among other things, Democrats contend that California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has refused to let witnesses proposed by Democrats give public testimony.  They also claim he has been demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas Holder is accused of violating. Specifically, Issa and other Republicans are seeking documents showing why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that denied any major flaws in Operation Fast and Furious. Holder has repeatedly refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama last week to assert executive privilege over such documents. Opinion: Holder contempt vote sign of 'broken' Washington? A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. Some gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, maintain that the program allowed hundreds of weapons, including assault rifles, to end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels in order for the Obama administration to press for new gun control laws.  The NRA heavily pressured House members -- most notably moderate and conservative Democrats -- to back the contempt measures. The contempt vote in Issa's committee last week fell along strict party lines, with Republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and Democrats opposing it.  The vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution. Rarely has any pro-gun-rights Democrat representing a rural and Southern district broken with the NRA's position on key votes, especially in an election year. Meanwhile, Pelosi argued last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November.  Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, chastised Republicans earlier this week for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm Obama's re-election chances in November. \"This is just all part of a continuing plan, and whether it's suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy -- this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see President Obama fail than the nation succeed,\" Larson said.

        "document": "The crisp white powder crunches under foot, stacks of crystalline rock sparkle and ‘icicles’ glitter from above. No, it’s not a secluded Alpine cave but a clinic in West London. The white powder isn’t snow, it’s salt. So are the icicles and the rocks piled in the corner. I am standing in the Adalex Clinic’s recently-opened ‘salt grotto’. The grotto (actually, it’s less of a ‘grotto’ than just a plain old room with assorted sun loungers) is the brainchild of Grace Hart, a psychologist. Magic grotto? A sceptical Alice-Azania Jarvis chills out in the salt cave in West London . She says that such grottos are commonplace in her native Poland, and claims that a spell in its salty confines — a typical session lasts an hour and costs £25 — offers all manner of health benefits, from relieving asthma to improving blood circulation and lowering blood pressure. Above all, after an hour in the grotto I should experience, she says, a sense of ‘psycho physical comfort’. Which definitely sounds like a good thing — even if I’m not entirely sure what she means by it. Actually, quite a lot of what clinic manager Grace says about the health benefits of the salt grotto doesn’t bear close scrutiny. ‘It’s about feeling good, mentally and physically,’ she tells me. ‘You will feel calm and refreshed, and you won’t have any anxiety.’ Benefits: Salt is rich in minerals such as iodine, potassium and bromide . The apparently miraculous power of salt is all, she says, down to its ‘micro-elements’. Salt is rich in minerals such as iodine, potassium and bromide. Usually, we get these by eating it — but Grace believes we can absorb them by sitting in a room full of the stuff. ‘We are depleted of micro-elements because our water is polluted, our diet is bad. But micro-elements like bromide have a calming effect on the brain. If you are stressed out, you can become calm in a natural way.’ As well as a new-found sense of calm, after an hour in the grotto, she promises, I should feel reinvigorated and healthy. ‘The air is very clean inside the grotto — ten times cleaner than normal air,’ she continues. ‘Salt is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial. You start breathing slower and deeper as the salt opens up your bronchial airways. You breathe better and you feel better.’ While it may sound like bunkum (OK, it definitely does sound like bunkum), in Central and Eastern Europe they have been using salt grottos — both natural and artificial — for donkey’s years. The first was set up 150 years ago after Dr Feliks Boczkowski, a Polish physician from Wieliczka, near Krakow, noted that local salt miners didn’t suffer from lung diseases. A natural grotto was carved out within the Wieliczka mines themselves, 400 feet underground. It became popular with those suffering respiratory disease, and is still in use today. Before I’m allowed into Grace’s grotto, she hands me a pair of blue plastic shoe covers to protect both the salt and my shoes. To keep the salt fresh, it is regularly topped up from the stash of enormous 25kg sacks kept in a storage room at the back. And it definitely is salt. After Grace closes the grotto’s outer door and leaves me alone, I taste a pinch just to be sure. The PA system in the corner plays a pan-pipes version of Just The Way You Are, while angled lamps make the salt look rosy pink, with blotches of blue on the ceiling and orange stripes along the walls. Believer: Former psychologist Grace Holt says an hour in the salt cave offers all manner of health benefits . It’s a little like being in a Seventies nightclub. Nevertheless, after 20 minutes in the cave, the promised sense of calm is indeed descending. In fact, I’m starting to nod off. I’m seated on a squishy sun lounger and wrapped up in a snuggly blanket which Grace has provided. Though there are magazines in the waiting room, in the grotto there’s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep. Clients are asked to leave their mobile phones behind. There is a soporific sound of gently trickling water coming from what looks like an enormous garden water feature. This, explains Grace, is the grotto’s ‘evaporation tower’. A good six feet high, it features an artfully-arranged fan of salt-encrusted twigs inside a giant wooden display case. Water flowing from a tank concealed within the tower’s wardrobe-like structure is trickling over them. It’s brine, brought over from Poland, Grace tells me. ‘It is one of the most healthy, healing waters,’ she says. It is a very special mineral water. Sitting near it as it flows, many of your positive ions will change to negative ions, which always make you feel better. ‘In the city, there are a lot of positive ions — which make you feel anxious, angry and agitated. Tranquil: Though there are magazines in the waiting room, in the grotto there¿s nothing to do but drift in and out of sleep . Negative ions make you feel refreshed and fantastic.’ From what I can remember of GCSE physics, ions are simply atoms or molecules with positive or negative electrical charges. Why they should leave you anxious or refreshed eludes me. The twigs, meanwhile, are birch — a ‘healing wood’ according to Grace. But of course! The salt itself is equally exotic. The three tons which cover the floor have been brought from Poland, while the rocks lining the walls and piled at the corners are Himalayan salt imported from Pakistan. According to Grace: ‘Not every salt has all the special properties. Himalayan salt has 84 different micro-elements.’ In total, the room contains more than 10 tons of salt. Building it took a month and cost £35,000. There’s no doubt that lolling around in my sun lounger is a rather pleasant way to while away an hour — but how does the scientific evidence stack up? Unfortunately, there isn’t a huge amount. ‘I know of no good scientific evidence about this approach and see no reason why this should be any better than relaxing in any other quiet environment,’ says Professor Edzard Ernst, a physician and former Professor of Complementary Medicine at Exeter University. Wendy Sadler, of Science Made Simple, an independent organisation aimed at explaining scientific research to the public, agrees — and questions the idea that exposure to ‘micro-particles’ and ‘negative ions’ can make you feel calmer and more energised. She says: ‘There’s no reason at all you should feel calm because of exposure to negative ions. And there have been no studies that have shown mineral water will convert positive ions to negative ones.’ Neither is there much to support the myriad other health benefits salt grottos purport to offer. Malayka Rahman, research officer at Asthma UK, says that while some sufferers have noticed short-term benefits, it is not clear whether that’s down to salt or simply the effect of an hour’s relaxation. A couple of months ago a similar business, the Salt Cave — a company which operates a chain of grottos across the UK — was forced to remove a section of its website which claimed salt therapy could treat various ailments, including cystic fibrosis and psoriasis. The Advertising Standards Authority concluded that there was insufficient evidence. Inconclusive: Unfortunately there isn't much scientific evidence to support the supposed health benefits of using a salt cave . Grace is unperturbed by such naysayers. ‘There’s always a war between traditional doctors and alternative therapies,’ she says. ‘The medical world is like a Mafia. You can’t patent a natural thing like this, so there’s no money in it for them.’ And anyway, she says, business is booming. Though the clinic is ghostly quiet during my time there, Grace claims her grotto often has 30 customers a day. Clients hoping to treat their asthma are recommended to make two or three visits a week for seven or eight weeks — at a cost of more than £400. It sounds an awful lot to realign your ions, if you ask me. You can even hire the grotto for private parties — complete with champagne and canapés in the clinic’s sleek white reception area. The next marketing opportunity is a new wrinkle cream made with hemp oil and (yes, you guessed it) Himalayan salt. Grace says: ‘Salt keeps moisture in the skin and smooths it out. Look, I’m 62, but I don’t have many wrinkles.’ (It is true that she does look some ten years younger than her age.) As for me? Well, I can’t say I experience any great transformation. Grace tells me I should sleep deeply that night, and certainly I leave the clinic feeling relaxed. But whether that’s the salt at work or has more to do with the fact that I’ve spent an hour snoozing on a sun lounger, I don’t know. At any rate, it was a perfectly pleasant — if expensive — way to spend a morning. As for any supposed health benefits . . . well, I’d take those with a pinch of salt.",

        "document": "By . Jason Groves and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:00 EST, 4 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:40 EST, 6 September 2012 . David Cameron was accused of presiding over a damaging 'fudge-a-rama' on Heathrow last night – as it emerged that an independent review of airport capacity will not report back for three years. The Prime Minister told MPs that he would be announcing an independent commission in the coming days in a bid to settle the vexed question on where new airport capacity in the South East should be put. Former CBI boss Sir Howard Davies will lead the review, which ministers hope will win cross-party backing. Scroll down for video . Finger pointing: Boris Johnson has vowed to fight any Heathrow expansion and challenged David Cameron to rule it out 'forever' But the appointment of Sir Howard, who made his name as an advocate for business, is likely to raise eyebrows. Green groups also drew attention to his time as a special adviser to former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who is now one of the country's leading climate change sceptics. Sir Howard, who oversaw the creation of the Financial Services Authority, hit the headlines last year when he was forced to quit as director of the London School of Economics following revelations about its links to Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Boris Johnson and David Cameron are good friends - but they have a funny way of showing it. The Mayor of London has regularly launched attacks and poked fun at the Prime Minister. Mr . Johnson was elected for a second term in charge of the capital in May, . but used a speech to supporters to admit they did it despite the Prime . Minister. Mocking him Boris said: 'We survived the rain, . the BBC, the Budget - and the endorsement of David Cameron.' Four years earlier, Boris turned on Mr Cameron over his claims that British society was 'broken'. He . said that the now Prime Minister's claims were 'piffle' adding that the . success of British Olympians in Beijing proves youngsters are far from . 'aimless, . feckless and hopeless, addicted to their PlayStations'. But . it was just last month that the Mayor launched an extraordinary attack . on David Cameron yesterday, warning him to stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on . the economy. He urged Mr Cameron to be more . ‘ambitious’ by cutting taxes, cutting regulation and investing in . infrastructure such as a new airport in the South-East. And now today he has tried to embarrass the Prime Minister over Heathrow. But his report will not be published until the summer of 2015, after the next election. The decision will cause dismay in the business community which argues that an urgent decision is needed to keep Britain competitive. London Mayor Boris Johnson launched a furious attack on the Government's stance, saying it was 'madness' to even consider expanding Heathrow. Mr Johnson, who is promoting his own scheme for a new runway on an island in the Thames estuary, said the decision to hold a three-year review would damage business. He said: 'It's just a fudge, it's just a fudge-a-rama and it's just an excuse for a delay – there's almost three years to run until 2015. 'If such a commission were not to report until after the next election we'd have lost a huge amount of time. I don't think British business would be remotely satisfied with that answer. 'What I worry about is that we are now seeing a stealthy U-turn being carried out which I don't think is in the interests of London or indeed of the country as a whole.' Asked if he would lead a campaign against expansion at Heathrow he replied: 'You bet I will, yes.' Mr Johnson acknowledged that No 10 was 'very cross' about his intervention and refused to rule out seeking a return to the Commons at a by-election to fight any attempt to expand Heathrow. Prominent Tory Zac Goldsmith, a former adviser on the environment to Mr Cameron, said he feared a U-turn on Heathrow was underway. He said this week's removal of Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who was firmly opposed to Heathrow expansion, showed that 'the Government is at least trying to open the door to the possibility of a third runway'. New Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is said to have an 'open mind' on Heathrow, although his new deputy Simon Burns has in the past described the idea of a third runway as 'environmental vandalism'. In the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted that Government policy had not changed. He said: 'While I believe we need to establish a form of review that will bring parties together and make a decision about airport capacity, I will not be breaking my manifesto pledge.' Ed Miliband said he remained 'sceptical' about the case for a third runway at Britain's only international hub airport. Nick Clegg insisted a third runway 'will not happen' under the Coalition. 'My party's manifesto is against a third runway and the Coalition Agreement could not have been clearer – we have ruled out giving the go-ahead to a runway during this Parliament. It will not happen during this Parliament,' he said. Tory backbencher Tim Yeo, who last week called on Mr Cameron to show whether he is 'a man or a mouse' on airport capacity, said: 'We need more runway capacity in the South East in the 2020s – not in the 2030s.' Shoved out: A sombre Justine Greening (right) leaves No.10 just after David Cameron told her she is no . longer Transport Secretary. Boris Johnson (left) accused ministers of . being bent on a 'simply mad' plan . Expansion: Debate has raged for years over a 3rd runway at Heathrow and the reshuffle intensified speculation there could be a u-turn on the issue . Anger: Tory Zac Goldsmith says he would stand down over the issue as he believes his party must protect those under the Heathrow flight path . Mr . Johnson, said Miss Greening had been a 'first-rate Transport . Secretary'. Prime Minister - David Cameron . Deputy Prime Minister - Nick Clegg . Foreign - William Hague . Chancellor  - George Osborne . Chief Secretary to the Treasury - Danny Alexander . Justice - Chris Grayling . Home Secretary - Theresa May . Defence - Philip Hammond .

Solicitor General – Oliver Heald . Chief Whip - Andrew Mitchell . 'There can be only one reason to move . her – and that is to expand Heathrow airport,' he said. 'It is simply . mad to build a new runway in the middle of West London. 'Nearly a third of the victims of aircraft noise in the whole of Europe live in the vicinity of Heathrow. 'Now it is clear that the Government wants to ditch its promises and send yet more planes over central London. 'The third runway would mean more . traffic, more noise, more pollution – and a serious reduction in the . quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people. We will fight this . all the way.' He told Sky News's Sunrise programme: 'There's lots of stuff been coming out of Whitehall to suggest that a U-turn is in progress and they want to build a third runway at Heathrow - all the pressure from businesses to do the third runway, that's where the Treasury seems to be focusing its hopes. 'I think that is a profound mistake. It is not deliverable, it would do massive environmental damage, not just in West London but for residents accross the city. There are much, much better solutions that will deliver long-term growth and jobs.' Prominent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith told the Today programme: 'I think it’s impossible to pretend that this isn’t a sign, because we haven’t just lost Justine Greening from this Department, we’ve also seen Theresa Villiers moved out – both of whom were absolutely rock solid on this issue in terms of defending what is still the Government’s line officially. 'The Conservative Party made an unambiguous promise before the election, as did the Liberal Democrats – it could not have been clearer; the Coalition Agreement immediately after the election could not have been clearer.' He again reiterated his threat to trigger a by-election if the Government did perform a U-turn. 'I promised people before the election that if the Government performed a U-turn, I would trigger an immediate by-election and that people in this constituency would have a chance to have their say. Absolutely [I stand by that],' he said. Ministers have come under intense . pressure from business to approve a third runway at Heathrow, Britain's . only international hub airport. Some Tories are also calling for a . U-turn, with former minister Tim Yeo saying the issue was a test of . whether the Prime Minister is a 'man or a mouse'. No 10 denied that Miss Greening's removal signalled a shift in aviation policy. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said a planned review of airport capacity would still go ahead. Farewell but not goodbye: Ken Clarke was moved aside as Justice Secretary but will be staying in the cabinet . Supporters of expansion at Heathrow . will be invited to make their case, but the spokesman said the Coalition . agreement, which rules out a third runway before 2015, still stood. But Andy Atkins, executive director of . Friends of the Earth, said Miss Greening had been 'shunted out of her . transport job because of her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow' adding that more airports or runways in the South-East 'would have a . devastating impact on local communities and the environment'. On HS2, Mr McLoughlin will face . opposition from Tory voters who live close to the proposed route. He . will also be under pressure to limit next January's planned 6.2 per cent . rise in rail fares. Vision: The 'Boris Island' Thames Estuary airport, pictured, would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year if built . Plan: The airport would be on the Isle of Grain in Kent and would have high-speed rail connections across Britain and Europe taking pressure of Heathrow .

        "document": "Rapper Tone Loc pleaded no contest Monday to domestic violence and other charges, about three and a half months after a fight with the mother of his child, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced. Tone Loc, whose real name is Anthony Smith, entered the plea in open court of single counts of corporal injury to a spouse, cohabitant or child's parent and possession of an assault weapon, the office said in a press release. The weapon -- a Colt AR-15 Sporter -- was found by investigators, but was not used in the domestic assault. There was no negotiated settlement, according to the district attorney. After the rapper addressed the court, Burbank Superior Court Judge Patrick Hegarty sentenced him to one day in county jail, three years of probation, 52 weeks of anger management counseling and 30 days of community service. He was arrested in June, following what Burbank Police Sgt. Tracy Sanchez then described as \"a physical altercation with the mother of his child.\" The entertainer then spent less than three hours in custody before posting a $50,000 bond, according to Sanchez. The 45-year-old rapper rose to stardom in 1988 with his hit singles \"Wild Thing\" and \"Funky Cold Medina.\" His deep, raspy voice made him famous not just in the music world, but also helped him as he scored acting roles on television and doing voice work.

Iran has activated a heavy-water production plant to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb, it was claimed last night. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been banned from scrutinising the heavily-guarded Arak facility for the past 18 months. But satellite images made public yesterday show clouds of steam emerging from the site, which is 150 miles south-west of the capital Tehran. Inspectors have been barred from scrutinising the heavy-water production plant in Arak for the past 18 months . The images emerged as the world’s leading countries resumed talks yesterday with Iran over its nuclear project, which the Islamic regime says is for peaceful purposes. The talks in Kazakhstan were the first in eight months between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. Western diplomats described the first day of the two day talks as ‘useful’. But they said Iranian negotiators did not immediately respond to demands that Tehran closes its underground nuclear facility Fordow . near the holy city of Qom, which is at  the centre of their concerns. The satellite images showed the site surrounded by anti-aircraft missiles and other military. The underground Fordow nuclear facility located deep in the mountains . near have long caused anxiety and western powers are demanding Tehran . closes the plant.

Advanced: The nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, taken in 2006 . For years, the powers had attempted a mix of economic pressure and . diplomacy to persuade Iran to scale back its atomic work, but Tehran has . insisted that sanctions are lifted before it complies with any demands. A Western official says the latest round of talks between world powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program have ended. It was not immediately clear what, if anything, was resolved in during the two days of negotiations that ended Wednesday. But Iranian state TV reported that technical experts for each side will meet in Istanbul in coming weeks to discuss the latest proposals. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton were expected to talk to reporters later. The Western official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. 'It is clear that nobody expects to come from Almaty with a fully done . deal,' the EU spokesman, Michael Mann, said before the meeting started. Iran has told the IAEA that it will begin operating the reactor at Arak . in the first three months of 2014 - a time when many believe will push . Israel into a first strike response. And though Tehran still lacks the technology to reprocess plutonium and . use it for a  weapon, North Korea has successfully developed that . technology and some analysts speculate that Iran could do the same. Major powers offered Iran limited sanctions relief in return for a halt . to the most controversial part of its atomic work during the first day . of the nuclear talks, and Iran promised to respond with a ‘proposal on . the same scale’. Last month Iran denied reports of a major explosion at its Fordow nuclear facility, one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites. The . country described the claims as Western propaganda which it said . is intended to influence upcoming international nuclear negotiations. The . reports originated with Israeli intelligence sources in Tel Aviv, who spoke of an explosion damaging the Fordow bunker . which is situated deep under a mountain near the religious city of Qom. In late 2011 Fordow began producing . uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity - below the 90 per cent . level used in nuclear bombs, but very high compared with the 3.5 percent . level needed for nuclear energy plants. The Islamic state says it is producing . 20 percent uranium to make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran that . produces medical isotopes, but the move provoked fears that the uranium could be converted to bomb-grade. Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment.",

        "document": "A vigilante cyclist has been dubbed 'the most hated man on two wheels' after using hidden cameras to help convict scores of drivers for motoring offences. Bus driver Dave Sherry, 37, uses three video cameras on his helmet and bike to capture footage of driving he deems dangerous. He also has a loud trucker's horn fitted to his handlebars to ward off vehicles. During the 40-mile round-trip commute from his home in Harlow, Essex to a depot in east London, bus driver Mr Sherry lets motorists know his views on their driving. He has even given a police officer a ticking off. Scroll down for video . 'Vigilante cyclist' Dave Sherry uses three cameras mounted on his bike in his campaign against bad driving . He takes his evidence to police and councils and says the footage has been used to secure 70 convictions for driving offences including speeding, overtaking too close and running red lights. He says he has secured two convictions for assault on him by angry drivers and is having a taxi driver investigated over claims he went the wrong way round a roundabout. Mr Sherry says he is now so notorious that he often has to fend off attacks from irate drivers, including several who have thrown punches. The London bus driver said he is now 'Britain's most hated cyclist'. He said: 'I do what I do because I want to make our roads safer for everyone. If people follow the Highway Code there would be so many fewer accidents and casualties.' Mr Sherry started filming drivers cycling from Harlow to his east London bus depot two-and-a-half years ago after he was involved in an accident. He said: 'Someone hit the back of my bike and the police said they couldn't do anything because it's my word against them. 'That spurred me on, so I went and got my cameras.' A number of the videos show cyclist Mr Sherry being attacked by drivers angered by his actions . As well as helping police investigate driving offences - he says two drivers have been prosecuted for assaul . Father-of-five Mr Sherry dismisses the vigilante label he has received but has faced a backlash from motorists and has been assaulted twice on the roads. He said: 'It might be strange that I'm also a bus driver too but I'm just trying to make a difference. I sit on the fence. 'I'm a cyclist, I'm a driver, I'm just trying to ensure there's space on the road for all of us by bringing bad drivers to justice. 'I'm doing the nitty gritty stuff people don't want to do. I might have a bad reputation as Britain's most hated cyclist, but so be it - I'm proud of what I do. 'If they want to call me a vigilante then fine, you have to play the bad guy sometimes, but I don't commit offences I just record them.' He added: 'If I catch you, you are going to be very, very sorry. I'd rather act as a deterrent than see someone on the floor - it is like a war zone out there.' Mr Sherry, who has driven buses for 12 years, got a van driver cautioned after he was physically assaulted after capturing a display of dangerous driving. In the latest video Mr Sherry posted to his Youtube account, he caught a woman endangering his life by pulling out in front of him at a roundabout in Waltham Forest, north London. He said: 'I reported it at when I finished work and got an email at 10am the next morning saying they are going to prosecute her. 'She got a lovely little note from the police that morning. Everyone must remember: we have a right to ride a bike but it's a privilege to use a car - and you can lose it at any time.' Films he has shot using the cameras are posted on YouTube and show drivers remonstrating with him . Mr Sherry claims to have helped secure 70 convictions using the three cameras on his bike and helmet . The bus driver insists he posts the videos to highlight bad driving and to keep the roads safe for cyclists . Mr Sherry is unapologetic to those caught by his cameras and says: 'It's like a war zone out there' Mr Sherry straps £1,000 worth of cameras to his bike for his daily rides and even resorted to wearing body armour for protection against motorists. To stay safe he dresses head to toe in fluorescent clothing and took to wearing £80 body armour after he was assaulted in the line of his self-appointed duty. He was punched in the stomach by a furious van driver, who police confirmed received a caution for ABH, in June 2013. He said: 'He just saw red and went for the attack. He properly knocked me back with a punch and I smashed the back of my head on rocks behind me. 'I had to go for an MRI scan and I had a minor concussion but luckily no bleeding on the brain. 'I've been verbally assaulted plenty of times too. But I don't have time to mess about with them any longer.' Mr Sherry captures up to 30 driving offences in a busy week, carries nine spare batteries so he can change them for every journey and rides a £2,000 carbon fibre Mekk 2G bike. He also has a £200 Garmin computer on his bike to record the time and location of each traffic violation he captures. As well as a camera mounted on his helmet, he also had one of the front and one of the rear of his bike . Mr Sherry is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cams. Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle. The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users. Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished. Lewis Dediare - aka 'Traffic Droid' - also posts footage from his helmet and handlebar cams online . Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year. He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions. The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling. He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.",

Online rant: Senator Ted Cruz has been the subject of Twitter vitriol . The man, identified as Troy Gilmore Jr, posted on Twitter Friday morning: 'Take down Ted Cruz, at his home' and listed Cruzâ€™s home address in Houston, Texas. 'Lets Find Ted Cruz, Texas address and show up his House, drag him out and B***h slap his A** in front of the country,' another tweet reads. 'Ted Cruz, we want you a** go the f*** back in Canada, else you and ur family will pay. U got a f***ing big mouth,' the same person wrote.

Cruzing for a bruising: Senator Ted Cruz has been threatened with violence by a Twitter user who apparently knows his address . He denied threatening Ted Cruz and urged his 49 followers to get Republicans out of Washington 'on a rail.' Troy Gilmore Jr has also been active on Facebook where he has published Cruz's address and numerous rants against the Republican party stemming from the government shutdown. 'Weâ€™re aware of it and have alerted the proper authorities. I canâ€™t comment further on security matters,' Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton told The Hill. According to The Hill, the threats weren't so much a call to action, since @ArmyVet54 did not have any Twitter followers. However, @KingKing now has 49.The man behind the handle identifies as an Army veteran, father of three and native of New Jersey who now lives in Florida.

        "document": "Can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty? It's a question more than one person I know is asking after Oklahoma's botched execution of Clayton Lockett. Not necessarily because of the way Oklahoma tortuously executed the convicted killer, but because of the hard-core way some reacted to Lockett's execution. Like Mike Christian. The pro-life Oklahoma state representative told The Associated Press, \"I realize this may sound harsh, but as a father and former lawman, I really don't care if it's by lethal injection, by the electric chair, firing squad, hanging, the guillotine or being fed to the lions.\" He also threatened to impeach judges who dared delay executions for any reason. This is from a man who is so strongly pro-life he voted for eight bills in four years to prevent women in Oklahoma from terminating their pregnancies, or, as many who oppose abortion say, \"killing babies.\" Color me confused. So, Rep. Christian says it's OK to kill, unless you're a woman who wants to end her pregnancy? As I told my friends during a heated debate last weekend, that smacks of hypocrisy. The only nonhypocritical viewpoint, I argued, exists in the Catholic Church. Catholics believe in the \"Consistent Ethic of Life.\"  As Georgetown's Father Thomas Reese puts it, \"we are concerned about a person from womb to tomb.\" \"Life is something that comes from God and shouldn't be taken away by man,\" Reese told me. Put simply, the Catholic Church opposes abortion and the death penalty. Period. Except nothing in life is that simple. Especially our collective views on the death penalty and abortion. If you ask a Southern Baptist, he or she will likely tell you the Catholic Church is wrong. \"There is no contradiction here,\" R. Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, told me, referring to Rep. Christian's underlying position. Christian's words were \"careless,\" and don't \"reflect any Biblical ... defense of the death penalty,\" he says, but it does not defy logic if Christian is pro-life and pro-death penalty. \"It's not an eye-for-an-eye kind of thing,\" explained Mohler. \"Retribution is not the same as a demand for justice. In Genesis 9, God speaks to Noah after the flood. When someone takes human life, they forfeit their own life.\" So, I asked, \"Should a woman who's had an abortion forfeit her own life?\" Mohler emphatically answered, \"no.\" Lockett deserved to die, he said, because the act of murder \"was taken in wanton disregard of the life taken and given the nature of the crime, this individual has forfeited his right to live.\" (Lockett not only raped and shot his victim, but ordered his accomplice to bury her alive.) Don't get me wrong; pro-lifers could argue that pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers are inconsistent, too. How can you choose to end life, but adamantly oppose the death penalty? Apparently, consistency is not America's strong suit. According to a 2010 study, only about 8% of Americans oppose abortion and the death penalty under all circumstances. James Unnever, professor of criminology at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, co-authored the study. He expected his test results to show a consistent belief system in all kinds of premeditated death. In other words, if you believe in the sanctity of life, you would be opposed to euthanasia, the death penalty and abortion. Turned out, that was not remotely true. \"From a religious position, the Catholic faith is the most consistent life ethic,\" Unnever says. \"Religion is only one factor that affects using the death penalty.\" The other factor, he says, is politics. \"When you get people who are against abortion and for the death penalty, that's not as much a religious effect as a politics effect. Politics trumps any religion.\" Jacinta Gau, professor of criminal justice at the University of Central Florida, co-authored two studies on attitudes about abortion and capital punishment. She was also surprised by the inconsistency many showed toward life issues. Of those who strongly oppose abortion, yet strongly approve of the death penalty, Gau says: \"What seems to link those two attitudes together is related to fundamentalism, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and an inflexible way of viewing society in general,\" Gau says.  \"I'm not sure they really view it as a contradiction.  There's a punitive attitude toward this -- kind of like if you don't want a child, don't engage in risky sexual behavior; if you kill someone, you deserve death.\" And Gau says pro-choice, anti-death penalty believers also don't see a contradiction. Those who are pro-choice don't \"see abortion as ending a life,\" she says. \"The death penalty becomes completely separate for the pro-choice people, because it's about a woman's right to choose.\" Truth told, the \"Consistent Ethic of Life,\" is relatively new to the Catholic Church. For centuries, the church supported capital punishment. But passionate pro-life and death penalty foes, such as Sister Helen Prejean, convinced the church that \"helping to kill a defenseless person\" in any circumstance is wrong. \"What's more innocent than an unborn baby?\" Prejean told me. \"It's easy to be against that.\" Then Prejean went for the jugular. The people who commit terrible crimes, \"Could you kill them? If there's a part of you who can't say yes to that, then you can't say yes to the death penalty.\" I must admit I was humbled by Prejean's question. Couple that with the fact we can now lock up violent criminals for life and I, again, find myself arguing for the \"Consistent Ethic of Life.\" As for Mohler, the Southern Baptist leader, he offered me this final thought:  \"If I had the opportunity to trade the death penalty for the affirmation of protection of the life of the unborn, I'd take it in a second.\" Let the debate rage on.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- A Border Patrol agent was shot and killed Tuesday, while another was wounded near Naco, Arizona, authorities said. The agents fell under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The agent killed was identified as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie. A native of Provo, Utah, he joined the Border Patrol in January 2008. Ivie is survived by a wife and two children. The agent who was wounded was not identified. After the shooting, he was airlifted to an area hospital and was reported to be in stable condition. His injuries were not life-threatening. \"Agent Ivie died in the line of duty, protecting our nation against those who threaten our way of life. His death only strengthens our resolve to enforce the rule of law and bring those responsible to justice,\" Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar said in a statement. The FBI is conducting a joint investigation with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI for the Phoenix division, declined to say whether the agents involved in the incident returned fire. He also declined to comment on whether any weapons had been found. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said investigators are at the scene. \"Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved,\" Breuer said. Agent Ivie is the 14th killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \"There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gunwalking strategy sanctioned by the federal government. It's a sad commentary,\" the Republican senator said. Turgal declined to comment on whether there could be a possible Fast and Furious connection to Tuesday's killing.

        "document": "As Congress voted on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010, one of the bill's architects, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, told a college audience that those pushing the legislation pitched it as a bill that would control spiraling health care costs even though most of the bill was focused on something else and there was no guarantee the bill would actually bend the cost curve. In recent days, the past comments of Gruber -- who in this 2010 speech notes that he \"helped write the federal bill\" and \"was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well\" -- have been given renewed attention. In previously posted but recently noticed speeches, Gruber discusses how those pushing the bill took part in an \"exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,\" taking advantage of voters' \"stupidity\" to create a law that would ultimately be good for them. In this fourth video, Gruber's language is not as stark as in three previous instances, but his suggestion that Obamacare proponents engaged in less-than-honest salesmanship remains. \"Barack Obama's not a stupid man, okay?\" Gruber said in his remarks at the College of the Holy Cross on March 11, 2010. \"He knew when he was running for president that quite frankly the American public doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured....What the American public cares about is costs. And that's why even though the bill that they made is 90% health insurance coverage and 10% about cost control, all you ever hear people talk about is cost control. How it's going to lower the cost of health care, that's all they talk about. Why? Because that's what people want to hear about because a majority of American care about health care costs.\" You can watch the speech on the C-SPAN website here . Gruber said the measures in the bill that attempt to lower costs constitute a \"spaghetti approach\" -- throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks. And while preferable to the status quo, Gruber said he could offer no guarantee that any of the measures would work. \"The only way we're going to stop our country from being a latter day Roman Empire and falling under its own weight is getting control of the growth rate of health care costs,\" he said. \"The problem is we don't know how.\" Experts \"know what the problem is,\" he said. \"Our providers are paid enormously high. In the 1950s surgeons are middle class guys like professors...Now they live on the Hamptons, the Cape, they're like investment bankers. Gruber said attempts to control costs in a real way were politically untenable. \"The problem is if we just say, 'Look, let's just cut our spending,' well, the problem is you're going to then eat into what the rich guys are getting that they're liking. And that doesn't go so well. That's going to be pretty hard politically. That's why no one has a politically feasible way right now to bend the cost curve, it just doesn't exist.\" Politicians could suggest capping costs but \"you wouldn't win many elections.\" The emergence of this videos from an important crafter of the legislation, repeatedly suggesting that \"stupid\" voters were misled for their own good by Obamacare supporters, is a potential political problem for the president. He now faces a Congress completely controlled by Republicans, determined to chip away at if not completely overturn the health care law. He also faces another U.S. Supreme Court case on the matter; Supreme Court Justices will assuredly be made aware of the Gruber comments one way or another. Asked about Gruber's comments from a 2013 University of Pennsylvania panel in which the economist said \"a lack of transparency was a huge political advantage for the President...\" in selling the bill to the American people, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said \"the process associated with writing and passing and implementing the Affordable Care Act has been extraordinarily transparent.\" Earnest insisted \"it is Republicans who have been less than forthright and transparent about what their proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act would do in terms of the choices that are available to middle-class families.  I know there is at least one very prominent Republican who campaigned for reelection saying that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, but yet keep in place the Affordable Care Act marketplace that has operated very successfully in his state.\" Asked about Gruber's reference to the \"stupidity of the American voter,\" Earnest said, \"I disagree vigorously with that assessment.\" Gruber declined to comment to CNN. Related: Third Obamacare architect video emerges . On Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked about Gruber's remarks. \"I don't know who he is,\" she said. \"He didn't help write our bill.\" A Washington Post story noted that Pelosi in 2009 cited Gruber's work approvingly. The Obama administration in recent days has suggested that efforts to bend the cost curve have been working. \"Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, there is evidence that we have bent the cost curve when it comes to health care,\" the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, said in September. \"Across the board, we have now held down health care price inflation to the lowest rate in 50 years.\" As Sophie Novack noted earlier this year in National Journal, the slowdown in the growth of health care costs is indeed \"promising, but analysts remain split over what accounts for the changeâ€”and, consequently, how long it will be sustained. The more pessimistic view is that the lower cost growth is a result of the recession and will inflate again as the economy recovers.\" A 2013 Kaiser Foundation study concluded that the struggling economy was responsible for 77% of the slowed growth, \"that the economy, including factors such as Gross Domestic Product growth and inflation, produces a major but delayed effect on the nation's health spending. This effect stretches over a period of six years, meaning that the recession that ended in 2009 will continue to dampen health care spending for several more years and that spending will increase gradually as the economy strengthens.\" At a press conference in 2010, President Obama told this reporter that \"bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do. I said at the time, it wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it wasn't going to happen next year. It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6, 7, 10 percent a year. And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs,\" he said. Obama added, \"as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins, that's going to increase our costs, we knew that. We didn't think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free, but that the long-term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care.\" The first few Gruber videos to get any media attention were documented over the course of the last year by Rich Weinstein, an investment adviser who became interested in the origins of the law after the price of insurance for his family doubled.",

        "document": "If you want to use your phone in London stay out of St Pancras, while people who want to talk on the phone on the train are best off with Three. That’s according to new research that looked at popular commuting routes in the capital. And they found one in three internet tasks were dropped and one in seven calls failed during testing. Scroll down for interactive map . Engineers have tested voice and data connections in London (shown in map). They travelled back and forth on the ten most popular lines. All were found to be plagued by poor voice and data connections. One in three internet tasks were dropped during testing . The research was carried out by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS). They carried out high-level tests while travelling back and forth on the ten most popular commuting routes in and our of London. And they found that the lines were plagued by reliability issues for both voice calls and data transfers. When attempting to send data ‘packets’ while on the routes, one in four 3G packets and one in three 4G packets didn’t send properly. EE, O2 and Vodafone were all found to rely heavily on their older 2G networks. Vodafone customers got the best 3G data service, while EE offered the best 4G service. But GWS’ testing suggests that it’s not just the mobile internet that Londoners struggle to use while commuting: one in seven voice calls (14 per cent) made from trains fail too. Three was a clear winner for call quality and reliability here. The poor service from the other operators was blamed on their continued use of 2G and half-rate codecs. One in seven calls were also found to fail due to networks still using 2G, although Three was found to be the best. Meanwhile the worst station to get a connection was found to be St Pancras . Meanwhile, one in four of the data task failures (24.18 per cent to be exact) GWS’ engineers experienced occurred while they were on trains in stations, while one in five occurred when they were on trains on open stretches of track. However, voice calls are more likely to fail on open track than in a station; one in four of the voice ‘failures’ GWS’ engineers experienced occurred when they were in a station, compared to 1 in 3 when they were on open track. GWS found that voice and data failures are more likely to occur when a train is travelling from zero to five miles (eight kilometres) per hour than when it is travelling between speeds of five and 50 (eight and 80 kilometres) per hour. Failures are most likely to occur when a train is travelling above 50mph (80km/h). For stations, St Pancras has by far and away the worst connectivity of all of those tested by GWS. The engineers experienced an average of 99 voice and packet data failures (across the four operators) while testing in the famous station. Paul Carter, CEO of GWS, commented: 'Leaves on the track, the wrong kind of snow, having to stand up all the way to work and back - commuters have enough to contend with without the kind of mobile connectivity problems we’re revealing today. 'It’s hard to believe we’re in 2014 and in a situation whereby a trained wizard would have a tough time getting a signal on the Hogwarts Express while it’s sitting in St Pancras. 'Pressure from commuters makes it inevitable that trains won’t keep their status as mobile dead zones for much longer. 'It’d be great to see networks, rail operators and station-masters taking the lead on improving connectivity for commuters - rather than having to be dragged into the 21st Century kicking and screaming.'",

In a number of cases, the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time. Now scientists from around the world are hoping to harvest PnTx2-6, the active ingredient in the spider's venom, to create a natural Viagra that can work in 20 minutes. Tremors, excessive salivation and difficulty breathing are all signs you may have been bitten by a Brazilian Wandering Spider (pictured). In a number of cases, the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time . Brazilian Wandering Spiders can cause priapism - a condition which occurs when blood becomes trapped in the penis, leading to abnormally long-lasting erections. To discover exactly how PnTx2-6 does this, Gwen Pearson from Wired reported that researchers cut off the penis of a dead mouse, and connected it to an electrical stimulator. Scientists from the University of Wisconsin were then able to measure the contraction of the muscles in tissue when they came into contact with different chemicals. They discovered that not only does the venom work, but it also has fewer side effects compared with existing erectile dysfunction drugs, such as Viagra. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement.  A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Stock pictured used . Never mind those little blue pills – men who have problems between the sheets could reinvigorate themselves simply by eating a Mediterranean diet. Eating fish, salads and olive oil, and enjoying the odd glass of wine, could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence, according to Greek cardiologist Athanasios Angelis. He said his research had shown that consuming such healthy foods helped clean out blood vessels, especially the narrow ones in the penis that are essential for a man to perform. Dr Angelis, an expert on erectile dysfunction at Hippokration Hospital in Athens, said: ‘The Mediterranean diet is well known to be a healthy diet, one that is associated with longevity, wellbeing, lower incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. ‘And this is very important, because people can choose this type of diet to prevent or restore their vascular health.’ He explained that when a man had problems achieving an erection, ‘it can be a sign of worse health problems to come’, because the blood vessels in the penis were ‘very, very sensitive’ to what was happening in the rest of the body. ‘Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reverse moderate erectile dysfunction,’ Dr Angelis said. Back in 2011, when the research took place, Dr Kenia Nunes, a physiologist at the college, said: 'The venom of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider is a very rich mixture of several molecules. 'These molecules are called toxins, and then we have various toxins in this venom with different activity. 'Because of this, when a human is bitten by this spider, we can observe many different symptoms including priapism, a condition in which the penis is continually erect.' Separate tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide, a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow. Since then, researchers have also successfully recreated the PnTx2-6 gene and infected a culture of caterpillar cells which produced the spider toxin. This artificial venom proved effective on rats. Ms Pearson reports that now scientists can create more of the venom, trials to determine the toxicity of the drug in humans may take place – although a product is likely to be years away. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement. For these men, the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis, or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ. Neither is very popular. A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Scientists from the University of Wisconsin found that not only does the venom work, but also has fewer side effects than existing erectile dysfunction drugs, such as Viagra .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- A rebel group that fought the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly two years announced Tuesday it would disarm. In a statement on the Facebook page for M23, leader Bertrand Bisimwa said the group would immediately end its rebellion and \"pursue, by purely political means, a search for solutions to the profound issues that led to its creation.\" The move came a day after the group and the Congolese government agreed to a ceasefire, during talks in South Africa. Previous talks took place in Uganda. \"To this effect, the major general and all unit commanders of the of the Congolese Revolutionary Army are asked to prepare the troops for the disarmament process,\" Bisimwa's statement added. \"This is a hopeful first step toward peace and prosperity in this region,\" said Russ Feingold, the U.S. special envoy to the Congo and the Great Lakes region. He predicted that the agreements could be signed \"in the next few days.\" But, he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Johannesburg, South Africa, \"no one should mistake this as the final solution to this problem.\" He noted that dozens of armed groups fighting over complex issues have killed more than 5 million people in the past two decades in the region. \"We need a broader political dialogue to solve that,\" he said. Feingold urged that amnesty not be granted to those who committed war crimes or crimes against humanity, but said he hoped that the \"vast majority\" of M23 members would be able to reintegrate into Congolese life. The Congolese government called the move a \"step in the right direction\" which came after rebel forces were defeated in their last strongholds by Congolese army and security forces. A government spokesman said the rebel group and government officials would eventually sign an 11-point declaration, according to a statement on the website of the state-run Congolese Press Agency. However, the spokesman said, the declaration would only be signed after the government could be certain that M23 members were taking the ceasefire and disarmament plan seriously. The announcement by M23's leader came as a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement Tuesday that 10,000 people had fled in recent days across DRC's eastern border at Bunagana into southwest Uganda's Kisoro district, a direct result of fighting between M23 and government troops. On Monday, the U.N. group transported 3,624 refugees from the border to the Nyakabande transit center, which is located 23 kilometers away. They represent the largest number in a day since the fighting between the government and M23 began in April 2012, the statement said. Other refugees were walking to the center, where 8,230 people were staying on Tuesday. The center has a capacity of 10,000, it added. \"Many of the new arrivals are suffering from dehydration and diarrhea,\" it said. More than half of the new arrivals were young children, many of whom had been separated from their parents while running from the border, it said. In late October, a U.N. peacekeeper was killed during fighting between Congolese forces and M23 rebels, according to a United Nations statement. The Tanzanian peacekeeper was part the U.N. Organization Stabilization Mission in the eastern part of the vast Central African nation. The mission was joining the Congolese military in an effort to protect civilians about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, the largest city in the region, the statement said. Rebels briefly held Goma a year ago. The eastern part of the DRC is a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of a bloody political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. Clashes in the region over the past year between the M23 rebel group and Congolese government troops have displaced more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N. M23 is named for a March 23, 2009, agreement it accuses the government of having violated. The soldiers, mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army last year, complaining of lack of pay, poor conditions and failure to receive promised promotions.",

The company says more than 55 million gamers visit its site every month. Scroll down for video . Twitch allows people to watch people play computer games live online, ad boasts over 55 million monthly users.

Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts. The system works on PCs, consoles and mobile phones. Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts. 'Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month,' said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. The deal is the latest example of Amazon expanding into new commercial arenas. It introduced its own smartphone, the Fire, this month. Earlier this summer, it added same-day delivery, a set-top video streaming device to its list of services for members of Prime, its $99 annual loyalty program. The firm already has an in-house gaming studio that makes games, and its Fire TV set top box was designed to attract gamers. Google was earlier in talks to buy Twitch, with reports emerging in May that the internet search giant had agreed to buy the company for $1 billion, but a deal was never confirmed. 'Today, I'm pleased to announce we've been acquired by Amazon,' said CEO Emmet Shear, announcing the deal on the company's blog. 'We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster. 'We're keeping most everything the same: our office, our employees, our brand, and most importantly our independence. 'But with Amazon's support we'll have the resources to bring you an even better Twitch.' It had been thought Google was the front runner. Video games are among the most popular content on YouTube, the world's No. 1 video website owned by Google. The site allows dedicated game fans to watch each other play online . However, Tech blog The Information first reported news of talks related to the Amazon deal early on Monday. The firm was first set up by Shear three years ago. 'It's almost unbelievable that slightly more than 3 years ago, Twitch didn't exist,' he wrote. 'The moment we launched, we knew we had stumbled across something special. 'But what followed surprised us as much as anyone else, and the impact it's had on both the community and us has been truly profound.'",

Decision: Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, pictured, says the 14 NotW staff will find out if they face charges within weeks . More than a dozen former News of the World journalists will find out by the end of this month if they face phone hacking charges, it was revealed today. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer says he is 'reasonably confident' the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will make a final decision on the 14 suspects within weeks. Journalists arrested and bailed include former editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, who may have directed or allowed their staff to intercept mobile phone voicemails. Former assistant editor Ian Edmondson, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and managing editor Stuart Kuttner were also arrested as part of the Metropolitan Police's hacking operation, known as Weeting. Starmer told the Guardian today that alleged phone hacking cases would be dealt with as 'a batch' meaning that the fate of those allegedly involved will be dramatically announced on the same day this month. Any hacking charges would be the first brought since 2007. The News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were then jailed for four months and six months respectively for intercepting messages from members of the royal family and their staff. Prosecutors are currently using a 'broad interpretation' of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), Starmer said, which will allow journalists to be charged with hacking even if the person had listened to the voicemail first. Probe: Former NotW staff arrested under Operation Weeting, pictured clockwise, include Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, former assistant editor Ian Edmondson, and former Managing Editor Stuart Kuttner . Former Met assistant commissioner John Yates had said previously it was not clear if someone could be prosecuted if a message had already been played back. Starmer also told the Guardian that alternative charges would also be considered 'in so far as it was necessary,' including conspiring to intercept communications and computer hacking. He added that the 'public interest' test was being applied to every case. If the person allegedly being hacked had acted with 'serious hypocrisy', like having an affair for example, this will also be considered, he said. Former News of the World editor Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks, and four others have already been charged by the CPS with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Arrests: Around 14 former NotW staff have been bailed by the Met . Brooks edited the News of the World and the Sun before becoming chief executive of parent company News International in 2009. Public furore erupted in July last year after it was reported that a private detective working for the News of the World, when Brooks was the editor, had hacked the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. The News International boss quit her post on July 15 2011. Two days later Scotland Yard detectives arrested her. Mrs Brooks faces three charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the maximum sentence for which is life imprisonment. She is accused of removing boxes of material from the News International archive and allegedly trying to conceal documents, computers and other items from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking. A further 33 people have been arrested under Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

A new rival for the Mini has come under fire because of its name. The Provo model, from Korean car-maker Kia, is billed as a 'radical super-mini coupe  which aims to set the streets alight'. But critics say Provo has unfortunate echoes of the name by which the Provisional IRA was known during its terror campaigns across Britain and Northern Ireland. Unfortunate: Critics say Kia's new Provo model echoes the name by which the Provisional IRA was known . Kia said the name had been chosen at its European headquarters in Frankfurt. A spokesman said: 'There was absolutely no intention to cause offence. The name comes from  'provoke' – as in provoking a reaction.' Ironically, despite the name, the roof of the model on display at the Geneva Motor Show is orange - the colour most closely associated with the Loyalist community in Northern Ireland. The Provo is powered by a turbo-charged 1.6 T-GDi 204 horse-power petrol engine linked to a smart four-wheel-drive hybrid electric system that can add another 45 horse-power surge to the rear wheels as required and also allowing low-speed electric-only motion. It is not the first time foreign car firms have come a cropper with their choice of names. The term Provo is associated with the Provisional IRA in Ireland and the UK. Pictured, a group of IRA militants setting fire to a van in Belfast in 1981 . Unintentional: A Kia spokesman said the company has 'absolutely no intention to cause offence' German car bosses at Volkswagen got into trouble in January 2012 launching the 'Black Up!' city car. Volkswagen executives in Britain argued successfully for the name to be changed in the UK to the 'Up! Black', fearing that it could give offence to ethnic minorities because of the connotation of white actors and singers 'blacking up' on stage to perform as minstrels. But in Germany and across the rest of Europe it continued to be sold as the 'Black Up!' because VW said the term did not have the same ‘resonance’ as in Britain. Volkswagen's British arm had sought in vain in the mid 1990s to change the name in the UK of its first people-mover called the 'Sharan' fearing it sounded too close to 'Sharon' and had connotations of the downmarket 'Kev and Sharon' from Essex. German bosses overruled them. Toyota’s MR2, when pronounced by French owners, sounds uncannily like 'merde!', while Mitsubishi’s Shogun off-roader is called the Pajereo in many markets - despite sounding like a rude Spanish word for a sexual act. Road wars: The Provo is set to take on the Mini and is billed as a 'radical super-mini coupe' Mitsubishi also produced a car called the Zero - the same name as the legendary Japanese fighter which inflicted such heavy casualties on the allies during World War II. In the 1960s Rolls-Royce, now owned by Germany’s BMW, were apparently going to call their successor to the Silver Cloud the 'Silver Mist' until it was pointed out that 'Mist' in German means pile of manure or dirt. General Motors, parent company of Vauxhall and Opel, produced a car called the Nova, which in Spanish-speaking markets means ‘no go.’ Nissan has had a Cedric and a Pantry Boy, though not in UK markets. Japan’s Mazda missed a beat with its Bongo and Bongo Friendee.",

It's unclear when the jury of 10 women and two men will hear opening statements. The jury selection Tuesday followed a full day of questioning. At one point, nearly half of 207 potential jurors raised their hands when asked by defense attorney Deric Walpole \"if you do not presume my client to be innocent.\" Jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child and one count of bigamy stemming from a 2008 raid on a ranch operated by his church. Authorities raided the Yearning for Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas, and removed 400 children who they feared had been sexually abused. Some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse and most of the children were later returned to their families. The ranch is operated by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, an offshoot sect of the mainstream Mormon Church. Walpole said he needs more time to present a defense, but Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said the defense has had sufficient time to prepare. District Judge Barbara Walther told the pool of potential jurors Monday that the trial could last two to three weeks. He is expected to be tried on the bigamy charge later. The FLDS splintered from the Mormon Church more than a century ago when Mormons renounced the practice of polygamy. Jeffs' church is believed to have about 10,000 followers.

The body of a 100-year-old suburban Detroit woman was found in her flooded condominium basement Tuesday, a day after heavy rain swamped much of the area and stranded motorists on water-clogged streets and freeways. The woman's daughter was concerned about her welfare and went to the home to check on her, said Warren Mayor James Fouts. The victim, Julia Sarno, apparently drowned in her own basement. A preliminary investigation shows that she either had a heart attack or fell into the water, WWJ reported. Scroll down for video . Cars were stranded along a flooded stretch of Interstate 696 near Detroit on Tuesday morning. Police divers had to search for people trapped inside their vehicles . Her death was the second blamed on storms that dumped 5.2 inches of rain on Warren on Monday. A 30-year-old woman suffered seizures and died after her vehicle became trapped in high water. Roughly 1,000 vehicles had been abandoned in floodwaters in the suburb where many roads were closed. 'This is going to go down as the great flood of 2014,' Fouts said. Fearing more drivers could become stranded after a storm dumped more than 6 inches of rain in some places in and around Detroit, the state warned commuters against driving in affected areas Tuesday morning. Tiffany Gatewood said Chrysler's Sterling Heights Assembly plant near Warren sent her and other workers home early Monday night. On her way home, Gatewood's Jeep stalled on a flooded entrance ramp to Interstate 696 and she had to swim to safety. 'I've never seen anything like this,' the 27-year-old said. 'It's like the world is coming to an end.' A stranded motorist sits on top his car as he awaits rescue from the flooded Southfield Freeway .

Authorities were urging drivers to avoid non-essential use of all metro Detroit freeways after heavy rain and thunderstorms left roads flooded and impassable . Warren Fire Chief David Frederick said bystanders pulled a Sterling Heights woman from her car after seeing her suffer seizures. They carried her into a nearby business and called firefighters who waded through chest-deep water to get her to an emergency vehicle. She was pronounced dead at a hospital, Frederick said. National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Thompson said the rainfall peaked in suburban Detroit at 6.25 inches. He said 4.57 inches fell at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, breaking the previous record for Aug. 11 at the airport of 2.06 inches in 1964. 'This was simply a record event of rain,' Gov. Rick Snyder said. 'We just need to work through it,' Snyder told reporters at Lansing's airport before boarding a state police helicopter to tour the affected areas.

This aerial photo shows flooded interstate 696 a day after several inches of rain fell in the Detroit area . Overcast to drizzly conditions were expected to clear overnight Tuesday, with sunshine over most of southern Michigan on Wednesday, the weather service said. It said three flooded rivers — the Lower Rouge at Inkster, the Rouge at Detroit and the Clinton at Clinton Township — were receding Tuesday night and expected to drop below flood stage soon. Wayne County Executive Robert Ficano declared a state of emergency and said he asked Snyder to push for federal resources. A state of emergency declaration by Michigan allows a variety of resources to potentially be made available including support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ficano said in a release. Fouts also declared a state of emergency for Warren. 'I spoke with Snyder and told him we were in need of help clearing roads of abandoned vehicles and basement flooding,' Fouts said. 'Now it's time for the state and federal government to give back what we've been giving. Right now, there are thousands of people in Warren who need help.'

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said crews were crisscrossing the city to identify flooded streets that needed clearing after the rain overwhelmed the sewer systems. Authorities closed portions of Interstates 75, 94, 696 and the Lodge and Southfield freeways Tuesday. Other roadways remained under water, while mud, debris and vehicles blocked traffic elsewhere.

        "document": "(CNN) -- Since it was revealed this week that the National Security Agency is collecting the telephone and Internet data of millions of people, this is the question most people have asked me more than any other: \"Why should I care that the government has all this information?\" On Thursday, as we were learning that the NSA has been storing the so-called metadata of millions of Verizon customers, a woman told me that she was less concerned about the intelligence agency knowing her phone number than she was the local CVS, which has been calling her at inconvenient times and pressuring her to renew prescriptions she was filling at another pharmacy. Maybe it's because we don't feel the surveillance state bearing down on us the way we do pushy marketers that many people aren't that concerned about the government compiling enormous databases on our digital activities. Indeed, we already knew that intelligence agencies have been doing this for years. In 2006, shortly after the revelation that the NSA was monitoring some Americans' phone conversations without warrants, a poll showed the public was evenly divided on whether it was a good or a bad practice. If it helped catch terrorists or prevent attacks, roughly half of the people responding were willing to give up some measure of privacy. Inherent to that calculation is our understanding that the definition of \"privacy\" has changed. It doesn't have remotely the same context as it did in the late 1970s when the law restricting the government's authorities to monitor Americans -- authorities that had been scandalously abused -- was enacted. Back then, our expectation of privacy extended to our relationships with our family and friends. To things like phone calls or the mail. Today, these personal connections, and the information we willingly share about ourselves, are the foundations of our increasingly public social networks. We know that complete strangers are looking at our Facebook pages. Should we be surprised that the government is too? Probably not. But you might be surprised to find out that all this information the NSA and other agencies are collecting is not very useful for stopping terrorists, which is why it's being collected in the first place. To date, there have been practically no examples of a terrorist plot being pre-emptively thwarted by data mining these huge electronic caches. (Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has said that the metadatabase has helped thwart a terrorist attack \"in the last few years,\" but the details have not been disclosed.) When I was writing my book, \"The Watchers,\" about the rise of these big surveillance systems, I met analyst after analyst who said that data mining tends to produce big, unwieldy masses of potential bad actors and threats, but rarely does it produce a solid lead on a terrorist plot. Those leads tend to come from more pedestrian investigative techniques, such as interviews and interrogations of detainees, or follow-ups on lists of phone numbers or e-mail addresses found in terrorists' laptops. That shoe-leather detective work is how the United States has tracked down so many terrorists. In fact, it's exactly how we found Osama bin Laden. Now, electronic data does play a crucial role in those investigations. But only when it is narrowly searched, with specific criteria at hand -- a name, say, or a phone number. Officials have said that this is how that metadatabase is used. Analysts can only look at it when they have the number of a suspected bad actor, and they want to search for his connections. That may offer some reassurance, however slim, that there are at least some controls on how that information is being searched. But we've also learned about a separate collection program, known as PRISM, that reportedly lets analysts tap directly into the central servers of top U.S. Internet companies, and then siphon off e-mails, photographs and audio and video files. We're told that U.S. individuals' information is routinely swept up in these searches, and that it's subsequently segregated from information about foreigners. But according to training manuals for PRISM examined by The Washington Post, analysts are told that when Americans get caught in the net, they should just file a quarterly report about the incident, and that \"it's nothing to worry about.\" This looks a lot like that big data mining that analysts have told me doesn't produce solid leads. What it does do is implicate potentially innocent Americans in a vast sweep of some of the most ostensibly private information there is, particularly your e-mails. Reasonable people can come to different conclusions about how comfortable they are with the government building all these databases. But we shouldn't accept officials' broad claims that these searches, and the information they're based on, are protecting the nation's security. If we're going to hand over so much information about our once-private lives, we should have some assurance that the trade is worth it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shane Harris.",

        "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The National Archives -- a repository of important government documents, including the U.S. Constitution -- has lost a computer hard drive containing large volumes of Clinton administration records, including the names, phone numbers and Social Security numbers of White House staff members and visitors. The National Archives has lost a hard drive containing large volumes of Clinton administration records. Officials at the Archives say they don't know how many confidential records are on the hard drive. But congressional aides briefed on the matter say it contains \"more than 100,000\" Social Security numbers, including one belonging to a daughter of then-Vice President Al Gore. It also contains Secret Service and White House operating procedures, the staffers said they were told. The hard drive was last seen in the National Archive's complex in College Park, Maryland, sometime between October of last year and the first week of February. It was discovered missing in late March, prompting a thorough search for the small, 2.5 pound device, the Archives said. When it could not be located, the inspector general's office opened a criminal investigation. On Wednesday, the Archives announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to its return. The Archives said no national security information is on the hard drive, nor any original documents. But they said it does contain \"personally identifiable information,\" and they take the loss \"very seriously.\" U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, whose staff was briefed on the matter, said the House will hold a hearing Thursday on the incident. \"If they [the National Archives' staff] can't handle a hard drive that may be sensitive properly, we need to ask the question, will they handle the most secret materials properly?\" Issa said. The Archives Wednesday gave the following account of the disappearance: . Last October, the hard drive was moved from a \"secure\" storage area to a workspace where it was being used for routine recopying to ensure preservation of the records. But work was halted last year because archivists \"wanted to investigate using automated tools to generate inspection reports.\" Staffers were moved to other projects until an automated tool was found in mid-March -- that's when they found the hard drive was missing. The device is described as a two terabyte Western Digital MY BOOK external hard drive, measuring 6.5 x 2.1 x 5.4 inches. More than 110 4-millimeter tape cartridges were copied onto the hard drive. The records included records from the Clinton Administration Executive Office of the President. The archives said no original records have been lost, and the Archives has a backup hard drive that will enable them to determine what information is on the missing device. The inspector general said at least 100 people had access to the area where the hard drive was left unsecured, and that janitors, visitors and others also passed through the area. The Archives said it is reviewing the data on a copy of the missing hard drive and compiling a list of people whose personal information may be compromised. It will notify individuals of the potential breach and will provide them with a year of credit monitoring, the Archives said. \"Because of the extremely large volume of data on the drive, we do not know yet the number of individuals whose privacy has been affected,\" the Archives said Wednesday. \"As individuals are identified, they will be notified.\" The Archives also said it has taken steps to improve security, including both physical control of records and the treatment of personal information.",

        "document": "Peter Ryley was given too many sedatives at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham which led to him falling and dying . A Grandfather with dementia suffered a fatal fall in hospital after being given a cocktail of drugs to ‘keep him quiet’. Peter Ryley, 76, smashed his head on the floor and suffered a brain haemorrhage after excessive amounts of  sedatives left him ‘practically delirious’. Nurses found him, unconscious and bleeding, 40 minutes after he was given three doses of powerful drugs in just five minutes. The married father of four, who had been admitted to hospital with bowel problems, died five days after the fall. The NHS trust in question has apologised and admitted full responsibility for Mr Ryley’s death, after his family instructed lawyers to investigate whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. Staff had failed to act after a risk assessment recommended steps to prevent the retired steel worker from seriously injuring himself on the ward. The Mail has long called for an improvement in care of dementia sufferers as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Yesterday Mr Ryley’s family told of their anger and devastation at how he was stripped of his dignity, and given a chemical cosh by those who should have been caring for him. Son Andrew, 44, said: ‘Dad’s dementia meant he did need a lot of care – but rather than reassuring him and trying to keep him occupied, it came to light at the inquest that the medical staff just kept increasing his sedation levels. ‘In the end he was practically delirious from all the drugs he had been given, but no steps were taken by the nurses to prevent him from being a danger to himself. ‘We’ve been left devastated by the way Dad was treated. He should have been shown some dignity and respect in his final days, but sadly the main goal of the nurses and doctors was to keep him quiet. The hospital have apologised, but the apology felt empty.’ Chief executive of the hospital Peter Homa said: 'I wish to reiterate the Trust's sincere apologies to his family for the fatal head injury Mr Ryley sustained after falling in our care' Research by the British Journal of General Practice has shown that one in four dementia sufferers are treated with 'last resort' antipsychotic drugs.Antipsychotics are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in patients with mental illnesses. But researchers have found that in most cases they are just given to sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off. The drugs – dubbed a ‘chemical cosh’ – have been found to double the risk of death and actually worsen patients’ symptoms leaving them unable to walk or speak coherently. In 2011, the Department of Health warned the drugs were leading to 1,800 needless deaths a year. Around 770,000 Britons are thought to have some form of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. But it is not known how many are being given antipsychotics or how long they have been on them. Research has also shown that dementia patients in care homes in some parts of England are six times more likely to be prescribed the drugs than in other areas. Mr Ryley, of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, was . given a sedative soon after being admitted to Queen’s Medical Centre in . Nottingham on January 3, 2011. The doses continued throughout the . following days, despite a doctor expressing concerns that he should not . receive any more drugs. Three days later, a falls risk-assessment identified him as a high-risk . patient. As a result,  a care plan recommended additional night staff to . help care for him, and for a nurse to be visible at all times. It also . suggested lowering his bed. None of these steps were taken, and on January 17 Mr Ryley suffered the . fall which later killed him. X-rays show he suffered a severe brain . haemorrhage. He had been married to Patricia, 72, for 40 years, and had ten . grandchildren. Andrew Ryley said: ‘It soon became clear that staff were . so overstretched they didn’t have the necessary resources to care for . him. ‘The hospital report says he was given Diazepam. Five minutes later he . was given 1milligram of Lorazepam and 50mg of Tramadol. Just 40 minutes . later he was found on the floor by nurses.’ A post-mortem examination . found that Mr Ryley’s system contained high levels of the three . aforementioned drugs, as well as another sedative, Zopiclone. An inquest last September found Mr Ryley died as a result of the head . injury sustained in the fall. In a narrative verdict, the coroner noted a . ‘continuing use of excess sedation’ and an ‘ongoing omission to fully . comply with fall-prevention policies’. Peter Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS . Trust, said: ‘I wish to reiterate the trust’s sincere apologies to Mr . Ryley’s family for the fatal head injury he sustained after falling in . our care.’ The trust – one of six branded ‘high risk’ for patient care by the Care . Quality Commission last week – is addressing several failings that were . identified in an internal investigation. These steps include new . guidelines for sedating agitated patients, and providing more dementia . support on every ward.",
