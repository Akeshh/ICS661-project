        "document": "Emily Clark is desperate for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant before the New Year, after doctors revealed she is battling cancer for a second time . Teenager Emily Clark dreams of becoming a doctor. But before she can embark on making her ambition a reality, the 17-year-old has another, more pressing challenge. Emily needs a life-saving bone marrow or stem cell transplant, and she needs it for Christmas. Last month specialists told the teenager a transplant is her only hope. The 17-year-old is fighting non hodgkin (burkitts) lymphoma for a second time. She was first diagnosed in December last year but after four courses of chemotherapy she was declared free of the disease in April. But Emily's world came crashing down again on November 13, when doctors revealed the cancer had returned. Her siblings were tested, but weren't a match for their sister, leaving a donation from a stranger the only option. And so Emily has launched a drive to encourage people to give the gift of life this Christmas, by signing up to the Anthony Nolan donation register. Emily, from Cwmbran in Wales, told MailOnline: 'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, good and proper.' The teenager, whose blog is called Remission Possible, has previously written in support of the charity and other families in need of a donor, not knowing she would one day need a transplant herself. Emily was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December 2013, after she noticed her stomach was swelling and her jeans had become tighter. Scans revealed the swelling was cancer. 'I'd never been to the GPs before. Being ill just didn't happen to me, it was normally my brothers and sisters,' Emily said. 'It was right before Christmas, and was just so much to take in; I knew it was going to change my life. 'I love school, I'm a total nerd so it was just horrible to know I was missing out. With every needle they stuck in, it just sunk in even more.' Following four courses of chemotherapy, Emily was given the news she was clear of cancer on April 17. It was this that spurred her on to start her blog Remission Possible, to help others facing similar journeys. The 17-year-old was first diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin (Burkitts) Lymphoma in December last year. After going into remission in April, her disease returned last month. Doctors revealed her only hope is a transplant from a stranger after tests revealed her sister Holly, pictured left, and other siblings aren't a match . 'It was simply amazing to be told I was in remission,' Emily said. 'It seemed like a great place to start the blog from, April 18, 2014, and my first full day officially cancer free. 'It was such a long time coming. 'I set up Remission Possible to thank everyone who helped me to be in remission and as the blog's tagline says, 'Because you never choose the mission of cancer - we all have to accept it and fight on'. Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system, an important part of the immune system. A patient with the disease will make too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. And those lymphocytes live longer than they should. The overload compromises the immune system, which is designed to protect the body from infection and disease. Lymphoma can develop in many parts of the body, including a person's lymph nodes, bone marrow, blood, spleen and other organs. There are two main types of lymphoma - non-hodgkin and hodgkin. Most are non-hodgkin lymphoma - the sixth most common cancer in the UK. Every year, around 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease in the UK. It is more common in older people, with one in six sufferers over the age of 65. Burkitt lymphoma is a rare form of non-hodgkin lymphoma, affecting the B-cells in the body. There are three different forms of Burkitt lymphoma, two of which are linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever. The third occurs in patients who have had an organ transplant and are taking medicines to stop their immune system rejecting the transplant. The most common early symptom is swelling in the lymph nodes. The lymphoma can often appear as a lump or mass in the tummy area, which can cause pain and swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. Some sufferers will also experience night sweats, high temperatures and weight loss. Source: Anthony Nolan Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support . 'I wanted to help young people in their fight and raise awareness so others can see the symptoms of cancer.' While she was in remission, Emily supported various campaigns for people searching for a match like the Help Hollie #pantsonyourhead campaign. At the time, Emily had no idea she would be launching a similar campaign of her own. Last month, after feeling unwell, the 17-year-old went back to the doctors. They revealed her cancer had returned, and for Emily, life was put on hold. She postponed plans to study medicine at university. 'I was devastated, I had just applied to university and my life was getting back on track,' she said. 'Relapsing isn't the end of Remission Possible, it may be our true beginning. 'I have no choice but to accept my new mission. 'This time we're bringing out all the weaponry, guns blazing to kick this cancer's ass, and forever, not just for me but for the 2,000 other people out there who need a transplant each year.' Since launching her campaign to encourage people to sign the register, Anthony Nolan have received 278 successful applications in Wales. And Emily has received support from celebrity comedian Matt Lucas and singer Michael Ball, who tweeted about Emily's blog. Emily's mother, Donna said: 'When Emily was diagnosed with cancer our world changed in an instant. 'But I now feel empowered to make a difference by signing up as many people to the register as possible. 'I can't thank enough every person who has signed up to the register for Emily and others like her. Together we can help Emily make another mission possible to beat cancer again.' Emily's cancer returning was the latest in a long line of challenges the Clark family have faced in recent years. Since 2006, her siblings, Holly, 16, Evan, 10 and five-year-old Libby, have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, dyslexia and dyspraxia. Mrs Clark, said: 'Our family life has been through a lot of changes over the past year, and we've been as honest as you can be with a four, nine and 15-year-old. 'Christmas had to be rescheduled and having younger children was a juggling act. 'Footie practice, choir and GCSEs exams also had to continue as family life had to go on in some capacity, for everyone's sake. Emily has launched a campaign urging people to give the gift of life this Christmas by joining Anthony Nolan's donation register . Emily's family have faced a difficult few years. Since 2006 her siblings, Holly, 16, Evan, 10 and five-year-old Libby, have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, dyslexia and dyspraxia . 'Emily missed home and the little ones missed her - winter coughs colds kept us all apart at times. 'Myself and my husband Andrew have missed each other, we passed on the motorway like ships in the night. 'Trying to ensure one of us was at the hospital 12 hours a day and the other was home was a mammoth task, as anyone can imagine. 'But we have also been blessed to be able to add to our family. We don't feel unlucky but the complete opposite. We are so lucky to have these children. They enrich our live beyond words.' Ann O'Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'Emily has been a selfless supporter of Anthony Nolan even before she needed a transplant by supporting other families in desperate need online. 'Emily is now reliant upon other strangers to join the register and pledge to save a life by donating their stem cells. 'What many people don't realise is how easy it is to join the bone marrow register – it simply involves filling in a form and providing a saliva sample.' To sign up to the Anthony Nolan register visit www.anthonynolan.org and tick 'Remission Possible' as your reason for joining.

Hotel staff refused to serve a man with Down's Syndrome fish fingers - because the dish was on the children's menu. Willie Forbes, 47, who visited the Royal Highland Hotel in Inverness for dinner while on holiday with his family, was told the meal - his favourite - was only available to under-12s, his niece claims. Mr Forbes' niece Clare . Cummings, 19, said staff at the Scottish hotel had discriminated against . her uncle because of his disability, and thousands of people aired their disgust at the incident on a . Facebook page calling for a boycott of the venue. 'Unacceptable': Willie Forbes, 47, seen with his niece Clare Cummings, was told by staff at the Royal Highland Hotel he could not have the dish he wanted because it was on the children's menu . Anger: The hotel in Inverness has come under fire for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the dish he ordered . The page - on which the hotel was branded 'disgusting', 'shocking' and 'disgraceful' for refusing to serve Mr Forbes the meal he wanted - appears to have been taken down. The firm's regional manager Indranil Banerjee issued an apology via the hotel's own Facebook page for the upset caused to Mr Forbes and his family, but insisted staff had not discriminated against him because of his disability. The hotel in Station Square is investigating the incident. 'Regret': Regional manager Indranil Banerjee apologised for the distress caused to Mr Forbes but insisted the hotel did not discriminate against him . Mr Forbes lives in supported accommodation in Aberdeen, but was in Inverness for the day following a weekend at Lochloy Holiday Park in Nairn with Miss Cumming and her mother Linda. Miss Cumming said the trio went into the restaurant at the Royal Highland Hotel for a meal, but were told Mr Forbes could not have the fish fingers from the children's menu because it was only for those aged under 12. 'I tried to explain he had Down’s Syndrome and had special dietary requirements,' she said. 'He . can’t eat big portions, only little portions. The waitress went and got . a supervisor but he was like, \"No, you can’t have that\". We just got up . and left.' Miss Cumming said they ate next door at the Filling Station restaurant, where staff 'couldn't have been nicer'. 'We got the kids' menu and everything,' she said. Miss Cumming said she was convinced Royal Highland staff discriminated against her uncle because of his disability. 'They made us feel like we weren't part of the clientele. It is just unacceptable,' she said. The shocked teenager described her family's experience on her Facebook page, and someone unknown to the family later set up a page calling on people to boycott the hotel in response. Mr Banerjee has urged Miss Cumming to contact the hotel as he said no direct complaint has been made. 'I would like to reassure all of our guests that we pride ourselves in providing equal opportunities to our diners. 'I truly regret the distress that Willie and his family have experienced,' he said. He said the family was offered a . choice of meals from the adult section of the menu - which included fish . goujons that would have been provided in a smaller serving. This was denied by Miss Cumming, who said she wanted Mr Banerjee to travel to Aberdeen and apologise to her uncle in person. A separate Facebook page was set up in support of the Royal Highland Hotel in the wake of the incident.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- This is a story about two brothers. They grew up in eastern Washington, joined the Marines and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of September 11. The brothers served valiantly, in the name of American freedom, to defend liberty and democracy abroad. They saw battle and bloodshed, bore witness to the loss of life and faced the unforgettable and haunting realities of war. The brothers returned to America emotionally shattered, psychologically distraught and forever changed. And the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to treat them. Years later, like many of their comrades, these brothers, whose names we are keeping private, suffer from severe post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, physical disabilities and memory loss. One lives with severe head injuries because of the bombs that went off beside him in Fallujah. The other was afraid to admit his suicidal thoughts. And when he finally did, the VA locked him in a room for several torturous hours until they ultimately let him go -- without any treatment or assistance whatsoever. He was left alone to replay and relive the horrors of war. This is unacceptable and inexcusable. As the wife of a retired Navy commander and the representative of the district covering Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington, I see firsthand the permanent effects of war -- both physical and psychological -- on those who serve our country. Nearly 30% of today's veterans return from war with some kind of service-related disability -- often PTSD or traumatic brain injury -- and too often, the VA fails them. Though recent reports highlight the fundamental inefficiencies and mismanagement within the agency, the VA has failed to protect America's veterans for far too long. This is a serious problem, and it demands a serious solution. Document: VA audit report released . This issue is about more than the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki; it's about changing the structure and culture that have pervaded the VA for decades. The secretary is not the root of the problem; he's simply the face of it. We need to modernize an outdated agency, bring it into the 21st century and ensure that the VA is better equipped to treat the health and psychological issues that are unique to our veterans. Shinseki apologizes, orders VA fixes . Moreover, the culture of the VA needs to change: Right now, too many veterans feel as if the VA treats them like a burden, leaving them both alone and untreated in the aftermath of war. We need to address the systemic, structural issues within the VA -- the misallocation of resources, the interminably long waiting lists, the bureaucratic inefficiencies -- to ensure that our American heroes are properly protected the second they return home from war. The House has taken swift action to do just that. Last week, we passed the overwhelmingly bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, which holds the VA accountable for actions that are both egregious and preventable. We urge the Senate to take immediate action on this legislation so we can get it to the president's desk and signed into law. We cannot afford to waste more time. With 23 deaths already attributed to delayed care -- and many more in which \"delay in treatment\" has been listed as a factor -- we refuse to let another veteran lose his or her life for something that can be prevented. When one joins the military, he or she is promised health care for life. So we need to make sure that happens. I am proud to join Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, in his legislation to allow veterans to seek outside care from private practitioners, paid for by the department, if they have been waiting more than 30 days for an appointment. Our veterans should be allowed to go to local doctors and hospitals to treat their physical conditions and rely on the VA for issues that are unique to their specific needs. It's time to bring the VA into the 21st century with stricter management, greater accountability and better care. While the agency has done great things -- such as its innovative work with prosthetics for disabled veterans or its telehealth system in regions like Spokane -- we need to take a closer look at the VA's infrastructure, its strategic plan and its allocation of resources. The agency needs greater accountability and transparency. But most of all, the VA needs to shift its priorities so the veteran is always the priority. We will keep fighting. We will fight to give veterans the care they deserve and were promised. We will fight to modernize the VA to meet the needs of today's service members. And we will fight for those two brothers in eastern Washington and for the millions of heroes just like them who have served America with unwavering resolve. They have protected us, and now we will protect them. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",

But just one month later, the 16-year-old's body had been ravaged by a deadly condition - and doctors have now warned she has just months to live. In the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself. She has since been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease - a life limiting disease that prevents the body from producing energy for vital organs and muscles. And since the prom night, Corah's devastated parents have watched helplessly as the disease has taken over her body. Corah-Beth Slaney posing for the camera before going to her school prom. But just one month later, the 16-year-old was battling a deadly condition that had ravaged her body - and now has just months to live . Her parents watched in horror as within the space of a few weeks, the glamorous teenager became unable to walk, feed or wash herself . Her mother, Lisa, 43, said: 'After her prom night, Corah's health rapidly declined - and she's now unable to walk, feed or wash herself. 'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives and it's so rare that there's not much information about it. 'Doctors have warned us that Corah has months to live rather than years and we're just trying to make the most out of our time left as a family. 'It was heart-breaking to hear that our little girl had such an awful, terminal disease.' For her parents, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah's prom night is something we will treasure forever, it reminds us of the happy times we've shared. 'But despite her diagnosis she has never stopped smiling and still manages to try and sing when she's feeling well enough.' 'She is my only daughter as I have two older sons which makes this even harder for us to take.' 'Her condition means we are living on a timebomb we don't know how long we have left as a family.

For her parents Lisa and Carl, the picture of Corah at the prom is a 'precious', yet tragic reminder of the daughter they have lost. Her mother said: 'Mitochondrial disease has devastated our lives' What are mitochondria? In every cell in the body, mitochondria are responsible for producing energy (called ATP) that the cell needs to function. Cells make up tissues and organs in our bodies, for example the heart and liver. They are like power stations in our bodies, supplying the energy every cell needs to function. If our cells do not have energy, then the tissues or body organs that the cells are made up of do not work properly. One analogy is that if power stations do not produce enough energy for the country, there will be areas of blackout, where parts of the country cannot function. What is mitochondrial Disease? When a person has mitochondrial Disease the Mitochondria in the cells are not producing enough energy for the cell. Sometimes they do not work at all, and sometimes they are just not very efficient. If a cell does not get enough energy (ATP) it cannot function properly. There is a huge variety in the symptoms and severity of mitochondrial disease. It depends on how many cells are affected, and where they are in the body - so every person with mitochondrial disease is affected differently. Each individual affected will have a different combination of mitochondria that are working and not working within each cell. However, there are times when particular body systems are affected in a recognisable pattern and these have particular names, for example Alpers, Leigh’s disease, MELAS and MERRF. The commonest parts of the body affected are those that have the highest energy demands; brain, muscle, liver, heart and kidney. If a lot of mitochondria in the body are affected in the important body organs, like the brain, mitochondrial disease can be very serious. The symptoms of mitochondrial disease are usually progressive in body systems where the cells have a high demand for energy, such as brain cells. Source: The Lily Foundation . 'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16-years-old she relies on me to wash and dress her. 'We are just trying to make sure she has the best quality of life while she's still with us.' Doctors were at first baffled by Corah's symptoms but just one month later her parents were told the devastating news. The teenager's health had been fine until she was 12 years old. But in 2011, she developed diabetes and needed insulin with every meal. She then started suffering from seizures and was diagnosed with epilepsy. Her mother said: 'Corah's life had suddenly changed overnight and now her father and I had to help manage her health. 'That was devastating enough, but when her seizures started getting worse, we knew something wasn't adding up.' 'But it took years of hospital appointments before we got an accurate diagnosis - and the medication she was on failed to stop her having fits.' In June 2014, Corah, from Nottingham, was due to undergo life-changing brain surgery to help control her seizures. In preparation, Corah needed to be taken off all medication for this to be carried out - something that led to massive, uncontrollable fits. Mrs Slaney added: 'It wasn't until a specialist suggested that Corah may have mitochondrial disease that I had ever heard of it. 'A muscle biopsy was taken and it was then confirmed that Corah had this horrible disease.' The teenager's parents are now desperate to raise as much awareness as possible for the condition that will kill their daughter. They are currently waiting to go to Great Ormond Street to talk with consultants about the best drugs available to help her. Mrs Slaney said: said: 'Corah took a massive turn for the worst in December, she suffered a huge seizure and we all thought she was going to die.' Mitochondrial disease causes extreme tiredness, as well as involuntary movements. The seizures have left Corah with muscle weakness and she is now wheelchair bound. Corah's mother is now her full-time carer. She said: 'Corah's mind works perfectly fine so it's such a shame that at 16, she relies on me to wash and dress her' Desperate to spend as much time with her daughter as possible, her mother had taken up the role of Corah's full time carer. 'We're trying to get Corah to feed herself again, which would be amazing. But we don't know what's going to happen, so we just take each day as it comes.' Since Corah's diagnosis, the family have been doing all they can to keep her spirits up. Mrs Slaney added: 'Corah recently met Jessie J which really helped lift her spirits, she loves singing so it was fantastic for her to meet her idol. 'We're in the process of trying to get as many people as possible to send Corah video messages to cheer her up, she loves Keith Lemon.' Despite the family struggling to cope with Corah's shocking diagnosis, they are sharing her story in the hope of some way improving the lives of others with the terminal condition. The family has spoken out to try and raise awareness of the cruel condition that has wrecked Cora's life . Mrs Slaney said: 'Corah is constantly deteriorating and now that she can't do anything for herself. We are on the waiting list to get a wet room in our house. 'Originally the council placed Corah at the bottom of a two-year waiting list, but thanks to our supporters we are now at the top of that list. 'But unfortunately no funding will be available until April and even then, the work is likely to exceed the maximum grants available.' So the family have set up a fundraising page for Corah in a bid to raise the vital funds for her wet room and downstairs bedroom. Mrs Slaney added: 'I want to ensure Corah has the best quality of life possible and having her own downstairs area at home would greatly improve that. 'In just over two weeks we've raised over £7,000.' To help the family with their fundraising, visit: www.gofundme.com/SingASong4Corah . The family have pledged that any surplus funds will be donate to The Lily Foundation, which helps research into mitochondrial disease and other metabolic disorders.

        "document": "(CNN) -- President Obama says the new Buffett Rule \"is not class warfare,\" raising once again the question of why he and his party keep rowing back from one of the Democrats' most potent arguments. They seem to have accepted the Republicans' pejorative definition of economic class warfare as an un-American evil. As Warren Buffet points out, middle-income Americans ought to be protesting a system in which billionaires like him pay a third to a half of the 33% tax rate of Buffet's secretary. In fact, nonviolent class struggle over income distribution has a long and beneficial history in this country and most other industrial democracies. Starting with the rise of the Populist Party in the late 19th century, continuing into the Progressive Era and the New Deal, grabbing for and getting a bigger slice of the economic pie for wage earners has been a major stabilizing force in American democracy. We are now racing in the direction of income polarization and the political instability that inevitably accompanies the contraction of the middle class and a concentration of wealth within a tiny minority. Based on the numbers, President Obama ought to be able to win this argument easily. As former President Clinton pointed out in an interview Monday, 10% of the population have taken 90% of the benefits of economic growth. James Carville is probably right that it's time for Obama to fire the White House communications team and carry the economic fight to the Republicans. It could hardly hurt when the voters who are getting their pockets picked are siding with the Republican corporate oligarchs who used to be the Democrats' arch-villains. In the current journalistic environment only the rich may be greedy without blame, and it is not just Fox, but the mainstream media, as well, that parrots the \"class warfare\" criticism and puts a negative spin on anything that can be called \"populism.\" For their part, Congressional Democrats seem allergic to their own president's advocacy of a minimally fair tax rate on rich individuals and corporations. They are also timid about challenging the Republicans on their myth-making propaganda about \"job creators.\" What evidence can House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan produce that repealing Bush-era tax rates for couples making more than $250,000 and allowing the top marginal tax rates of 33 percent and 35 percent to revert to 36 percent and 39.6 percent next year would prevent corporations and investors from creating jobs? What can be deduced is that corporations are content to sit on their $2 trillion in cash reserves as long as tax breaks and lax regulations make reinvestment for growth a less attractive alternative. All MBA students are taught \"cash is king,\" and the banks have taken the slogan so seriously they won't even release to credit markets the $2 trillion in bailout funds given them as a gift outright. The job creators aren't creating anything. They're sitting on every tax-free dollar they can while the sitting is good. So how did we get to this point? Something is clearly wrong with Kansas and the rest of Middle America when it comes to letting economic self-interest guide their voting. The decline of the labor movement, which was a powerful instrument of economic education for the masses, surely must have something to do with it. Then there is the impact of more than 30 years of conservative distortion of America's economic vocabulary since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. He showed his party that making vague promises to preserve the \"safety net\" was smarter politics than tackling the real problems of Social Security disability, private pension funds and indigent health care. By 1984, the Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale, was ridiculed for trying to make campaign themes of \"fairness\" and \"compassion.\" This history gives one pause about urging Obama to argue more openly for fairer distribution of income. Certainly if we are in a class war over money, only one side is fighting. Probably not even Reagan, an ex-New Dealer, expected so complete a turnaround on what used to be called \"pocketbook issues.\" In interviewing a Republican guest, Mitch Daniels, Jon Stewart noted last week that the bottom 50% of the population owns less than 2.5% of the nation's wealth. If that's not the result of class warfare, Stewart wondered, what is? Put that way, the question seemed momentarily to fluster Daniels, as if he had not realized how completely the affluent have triumphed. Finally, Daniels allowed that maybe some tax fairness could be considered as long as it didn't hurt the job creators. No wonder he got thrown out of the Republican presidential race, given such blatant advocacy of class warfare against the deserving rich. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howell Raines.",

        "document": "By . Associated Press . The family of James Brady, the White House press secretary who was wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, says he has died. Brady was 73. Brady undertook a personal crusade for gun control after he suffered a devastating head wound outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981 and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears Brady's name and was singed into existence by former President Bill Clinton in 1993. A family spokesperson said that Brady had suffered a 'series of health issues' following his injury on that March day in 1981. Scroll Down for Video . Passed away: This March 30, 2011 file photo shows former White House press secretary James Brady as he gives the thumbs-up while visiting the Brady Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC . Although Brady returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is named in his honor. The law requires a five-day waiting period and background check on all handgun purchases. 'Jim touched the lives of so many and has been a wonderful husband, father, friend and role model,' his family said in a statement. 'We are enormously proud of Jim's remarkable accomplishments - before he was shot on the fateful day in 1981 while serving at the side of President Ronald Reagan and in the days, months and years that followed. Panic: This photograph from MArch, 1980, shows a US secret service agent with an automatic weapon watches over James Brady (center and Washington DC police officer, Thomas Delahanty, left) the president's secretary, after being wounded in an attempt on the life of President Ronald Reagan in Washington . Team: Former White House press secretary James Brady, (left), who was left paralyzed in the Reagan assassination attempt, looking at his wife Sarah Brady, during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington marking the 30th anniversary of the shooting . 'Jim Brady's zest for life was apparent to all who knew him, and despite his injuries and the pain he endured every day, he used his humor, wit and charm to bring smiles to others and make the world a better place.' 'Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the family of former White House Press Secretary James Brady on his passing.  Jim is a legend at the White House for his warmth and professionalism as press secretary for President Reagan; for the strength he brought to bear in recovering from the shooting that nearly killed him 33 years ago; and for turning the events of that terrible afternoon into a remarkable legacy of service through the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  Since 1993, the law that bears Jim’s name has kept guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  An untold number of people are alive today who otherwise wouldn’t be, thanks to Jim.' 'Every day, reporters and White House staffers walk past a plaque marking the day in 2000 that the White House Briefing Room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.  It reads, “May his courage and dedication continue to inspire all who work in this room and beyond.”  Those words will endure, as will his legacy.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim’s wife Sarah, who has been Jim’s steadfast partner in advocacy, and their children Scott and Melissa.' Brady suffered a bullet wound to his head outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981. Although he returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989. Nancy Reagan posted a statement on the death of James Brady on Monday afternoon. The former First Lady said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of Jim Brady's passing today. 'Thinking of him brings back so many memories - happy and sad - of a time in all our lives when we learned what it means to 'play the head we're dealt with.' She went on to say that in the 'short time he was able to serve as White House Press Secretary, Jim brough sharp instincts, integrity to one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.' Brady, who spent much of the rest of his life in a wheelchair, died at a retirement community in Alexandria, Virginia where he lived with his wife. A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears his name, as is the White House press briefing room. 'He is somebody who I think really revolutionized this job,' said Josh Earnest, President Barack Obama's press secretary. 'And even after he was wounded in that attack on the president, was somebody who showed his patriotism and commitment to the country by being very outspoken on an issue that was important to him and that he felt very strongly about.

Bravery, thanks and service: Washington, D.C.: Press Secretary James Brady cuts the ribbon opening the new press center at the White House as President and Nancy Reagan look on in November 1981, seven months on from the failed assassination attempt on Reagan's life . Brady 'leaves the kind of legacy ... that certainly this press secretary and all future press secretaries will aspire to live up to,' Earnest said. Of the four people stuck by gunfire on March 30, 1981, Brady was the most seriously wounded. A news clip of the shooting, replayed often on television, showed Brady sprawled on the ground as Secret Service agents hustled the wounded president into his limousine. Reagan was shot in one lung while a policeman and a Secret Service agent suffered lesser wounds. Brady never regained full health. The shooting caused brain damage, partial paralysis, short-term memory impairment, slurred speech and constant pain. The TV replays of the shooting did take a toll on Brady, however. He told The Associated Press years later that he relived the moment each time he saw it: 'I want to take every bit of (that) film ... and put them in a cement incinerator, slosh them with gasoline and throw a lighted cigarette in.' With remarkable courage, he endured a series of brain operations in the years after the shooting. On November 28, 1995, while he was in an oral surgeon's office, Brady's heart stopped beating and he was taken to a hospital. His wife, Sarah, credited the oral surgeon and his staff with saving Brady's life. Before: President Ronald Reagan and Jim Brady review documents in January, 1981, two months before the assassination attempt that would gravely wound both men . Hard at work: President Ronald Reagan sitting at desk for first time, as aides (R-L) Richard Allen, Edwin Meesek, James Brady, Michael Deaver & James Baker look on in the Oval Office of the White House - prior to March, 1981 . Brady was a strong Republican from an early age - as a boy of 12 in Centralia, Illinois where he was born on August 29, 1940, he distributed election literature for Dwight D. Eisenhower. In a long string of political jobs, Brady worked for some well-known bosses: Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, and John Connally, the former Texas governor who was running for president in 1979. When Connally dropped out, Brady joined Reagan's campaign as director of public affairs and research. There, his irrepressible wit made him popular with the press, but not necessarily with the Reaganites. He once ran through the Reagan campaign plane shouting \"Killer Trees! Killer Trees!\" as the aircraft flew over a forest fire. It was a jab at his own candidate's claim in a speech that trees cause as much pollution as cars. Brady remained as transition spokesman after Reagan's election. Return: President Reagan and his wife Nancy greet Press Secretary James Brady on his return to the White House after being critically wounded during the attempt on the president's life in March, 1981 . But Reagan's advisers appeared hesitant to give him the White House job. Nancy Reagan was said to feel the job required someone younger and better-looking than the 40-year-old, moon-faced, balding Brady. 'I come before you today not as just another pretty face, but out of sheer talent,' Brady told reporters. A week later, he got the job. Previously, he had worked in the administrations of presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford: as special assistant to the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as special assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and as an assistant to the defense secretary. He was divorced from the former Sue Beh when, in 1973, he courted Sarah Jane Kemp, the daughter of an FBI agent who was working with him in a congressional office. Sarah Brady became involved in gun-control efforts in 1985, and later chaired Handgun Control Inc., but Brady took a few more years to join her, and Reagan did not endorse their efforts until 10 years after he was shot. Ceremony: Former White House press secretary for President Reagan James Brady, left, in  a group photo following a dedication ceremony for the new James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington in 2000 . Tribute: Close-up of the plaque in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Monday, August 4, 2014. James Brady, former press secretary to Ronald Reagan who was severely wounded in a 1981 assassination attempt on the President . Reagan's surprise endorsement - he was a longtime National Rifle Association member and opponent of gun control laws - began to turn the tide in Congress. 'They're not going to accuse him of being some bed-wetting liberal, no way can they do that,\" said Brady, who had become an active lobbyist for the bill. The Brady law required a five-day wait and background check before a handgun could be sold. In November 1993, as President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, Brady said: . 'Every once in a while you need to wake up and smell the propane. I needed to be hit in the head before I started hitting the bricks.' Clinton awarded Brady the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. In 2000, the press briefing room at the White House was renamed in Brady's honor. The following year, Handgun Control Inc., was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as a tribute to Brady and his wife. Brady also served as vice chair of the National Organization on Disability and co-chair of the National Head Injury Foundation. Survivors include his wife, Sarah; a son, Scott; and a daughter, Melissa.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Far too often, children with developmental disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of their observable behavior, slotted into broad diagnostic pigeonholes and provided generalized treatments that may not always meet their specific needs. For instance, children are sometimes assigned with broad-spectrum labels of \"autism\" or \"attention deficit disorder\" after a single psychological assessment and are provided expensive therapies or prescribed strong medications with serious, long-term side effects. This incomplete diagnosis and/or overmedication can leave their underlying problems untreated and left to worsen, and compound the frustration of parents and child. Such an approach is analogous to trying to diagnose and treat a heart problem without ever doing a chest X-ray or ECG to looking at the heart. The essence of my talk at TED was simple: To diagnose any brain-related developmental disorder, it is crucial to look at the brain. Looking at behavior alone can provide an incomplete or misleading picture. Moreover, when looking at the brain, it is important to go beyond its structure to its function. This is because often in cognitive disorders, the structure of the brain is intact, but its function is compromised. Abnormalities in brain function have traditionally been detected using electroencephalography (EEG), which involves the measurement of the ongoing electrical activity generated by the brain. Traditional EEG appears as a pattern of spikes and waves that are visually inspected to detect these abnormalities. However, following more recent advances in technology, a pioneering EEG system known as Brain Electrical Activity Mapping (BEAM) has been developed at Harvard University by neurologist Dr. Frank Duffy. This system adds complex display schematics and statistical analyses to the traditional EEG recordings to provide more information about brain dysfunction. For instance, not only can BEAM map the patient's EEG recordings onto schematic 3-D maps of the head, but it can also estimate whether the EEG is outside the normal bounds for a child's age. This is achieved using a technique known as Statistical Probability Mapping, which compares the patient's EEG to a reference database of normal EEGs. The proprietary database contains EEG data on more than 2,000 fully screened, healthy subjects, making BEAM a unique and powerful investigative tool in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. For instance, when using BEAM we have found that many children who are diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from virtually undetectable brain seizures that are presenting with autism-like symptoms. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that one-third to one-half of children with autism may be prone to abnormal seizure-like activity in their brains, and up to one-third of children with autism may develop epilepsy by the time they reach adolescence. In some cases, this seizure-like activity may merely be a consequence of the underlying neurological problem that is causing autism; in others, it may be comorbid (co-existent) with autism. However, in yet other cases, such as the one I described at the TED conference, we found that the seizures are in fact the cause of the children's symptoms and, when treated, the level and speed of recovery in these children has been remarkable. Since some of these children's symptoms (staring into space or being unresponsive) were mistaken for those of autism during behavioral testing, we would never have identified the epileptiform seizure activity in their brains without an EEG test. Of course, many children diagnosed with autism and other developmental disorders do not have any seizures or abnormal EEG activity. And for some who do, this may not be the cause of all their symptoms. Hence, I do not suggest that neurophysiological tests like BEAM should be used as a replacement for behavioral tests, but that they should be used in conjunction with such tests, to triangulate more accurately the cause of the child's symptoms, and to ensure more targeted and effective treatments or therapies. Since my talk at TED, I have been working on making Harvard's EEG BEAM system more widely available, from the United States to India. Indeed, after the recent deluge of enquiries I have received, we are working on this with greater urgency. My goal is to have numerous systems worldwide that are fully accessible and affordable to all families. Until then, it is important for parents to understand that even a standard digital EEG test conducted by a local physician could help reveal whether seizure activity in the brain is contributing to their child's symptoms. Indeed, my talk at TED was not intended so much to highlight a particular system or technology as it was to emphasize the importance of a particular approach to these disorders. That approach is simple: to diagnose a developmental disorder accurately, we should look at the brain directly. Or, to recall a phrase I use when testing children: \"When we put this magic cap on you, your brain can finally talk to us, and we can finally listen!\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aditi Shankardass.",

        "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veterans groups are warning President Barack Obama against going ahead with a possible administration move to charge veterans' private health care for service-related injuries. Veterans groups say it's \"wholly unacceptable\" to charge their private insurance for service injuries. In a letter sent by 11 of the most prominent veterans organizations, the groups warned that the idea \"is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much.\" CNN obtained a copy of the letter sent to the White House last Friday by groups including The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Read the letter (PDF) A White House spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option is being considered. \"The details of specific proposals will be transmitted with the full submission in April. The president has made it clear that meeting the needs of veterans is one of his priorities, and as a result has requested an 11 percent increase in discretionary funding for 2010, and the administration is actively working with the veterans community to ensure we get the details of this budget right,\" said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro. In the letter, the groups said they have been told by sources on Capitol Hill and at the VA that the idea under consideration would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to bill health insurance for a treatment of a disability or injury that was a result of military service. The argument for the proposal is that it frees up money for the VA by charging the private insurers, allowing the VA to spend on more services, said Joe Violante, legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, who opposes the idea. While there could be savings, Violante warned it also could lead to an increase in premiums for veterans with private coverage. \"\"We cannot and would not agree to any proposal that would expand this concept any further,\" the heads of the 11 groups wrote in the letter. \"While we understand the fiscal difficulties this country faces right now, placing the burden of those fiscal problems on the men and women who have already sacrificed a great deal for this country is unconscionable.\" Currently, veterans' private insurance is only charged when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries, like getting the flu. Charging for service-related injuries would violate \"a sacred trust,\" said Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis. Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments. It could also make it harder for veterans to get private insurance if the companies decide to reject them for pre-existing conditions, rather than be billed for service-connected injuries, Davis said. \"This seems like bad politics and bad policy,\" said IAVA Policy Director Vanessa Williamson, noting that every veterans group opposes it and warns it will adversely affect veterans. \"I don't see this as a tenable option.\"",

Tinder and other match-making firms have proved explosively popular, especially among those in their 20s and 30s, providing users with lists of potential sexual partners nearby. But sexual health experts say 'hook-up' apps are leading to rises in sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Scroll down for video . Rates of sexually transmitted diseases have increased along with the rise of 'hook-up' apps, file photo . Free services such as Tinder allow users to meet up with like-minded adults to have casual sex . Gonorrhoea cases in England jumped 15 per cent between 2012 and 2013, according to official figures, from 25,577 to 29,291. Syphilis cases went up nine per cent, from 2,981 to 3,249. Peter Greenhouse, of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: 'You don't have to be a genius to work out that these sorts of apps make having casual sex a damn sight easier. 'You can find, down to a metre or two, the nearest available person who is interested. This is something that just hasn't been available before.' Millions now use Tinder, which lets users connect via their phones if they 'like' each other's picture. Advocates say it works because it is spontaneous and discreet, but critics believe it is making casual sex more normal. An app called Grindr is equally popular among gay men. Mr Greenhouse said: 'Thanks to Grindr or Tinder, you can acquire chlamydia in five minutes.' Chlamydia can cause infertility in women, though most clear it naturally. Gonorrhoea can cause infertility but needs antibiotics to clear it. Doctors are worried by a rise in antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea. Syphilis can lead to blindness, brain damage and even death if left untreated. Experts at Public Health England found such apps had a role in six outbreaks of syphilis across Britain since 2012. They were enabling 'hyper-efficient transmission' of infections, Dr Ian Simms of Public Health England told New Scientist magazine. Outbreaks that would once have been confined to one area were spreading to other towns and cities, he said. The companies behind these apps argue no firm evidence yet exists to link them to rises in STIs. But a spokesman for Public Health England said: 'The only way to get protection from STIs is to practise safer sex.'",

Police located the body of Sam Trott in a lake near his home in Landsdale on Wednesday, just before 10am Perth time. Speaking on behalf of Sam's parents Matthew and Lyndal, Geoff Trott said the family were 'devastated' and are still coming to terms with the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Sam Trott pictured here with his mother Lyndel and father Matthew Trott . 'Sam was very dear to us all and his premature passing is a tragedy we're still struggling to deal with,' Mr Trott said. 'He was a happy, affectionate and loving child, with an infectious smile and brought so much sunshine into our lives.' 'Sam could not have been blessed with more devoted parents than Matt and Lyndel, who have loved him unconditionally since the day he was born.' Mr Trott said Sam's parents had strived to give him a better life since he was diagnosed with Autism. 'They've been unrelenting in their goal to create every opportunity for him to thrive and fulfil his potential,' Mr Trott said. Two-year-old Sam Trott has been missing since 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door at Lansdale in Perth . He thanked the police, SES and all the volunteers who helped in the search for Sam. Mr Trott also mentioned how lucky they were to be part of such a 'wonderful community'. He said they were overwhelmed by the compassion shown by the community and the outpouring of grief. 'We'd like to thank the media for enablising the support of the community and for the respect they've shown our family in reporting on Sam's disappearance. 'We are especially grateful to the police for their rapid response and for the professionalism, and support, keeping us informed and staying with us at all times during this terrible ordeal.' Sam's parents have asked for any donations to be made to the Autism Association of WA in lieu of tributes. Incident Controller Inspector Gary Lewis said he wanted to make a particular note of the 'immense community support' the family received during the difficult time. Divers and emergency workers were searching Landsdale Lake near Perth on Wednesday morning when they discovered a body in the search for Sam Trott . 'At 3am we had people from as far as Rockingham and Warnbro arriving to assist in the inquires.' 'We'd like to thank those people.' 'I'd like to pay particular thanks to the vast numbers of SES, fire brigade, police and other emergency services who came out to assist. 'I'd like to make a request on behalf of the family that you respect their privacy at this time. 'When news broke this morning there was approximately 200 to 300 volunteers and they all looked visibly shaken.' Sam Trott's body was found in the lake at Landsdale's Warradale Park near Perth  by divers and emergency workers on Wednesday morning just before 10am local time. The two-year-old went missing at 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door after workmen left it open. The news of his death comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as  rescue teams  scoured the lakes and streets looking under cars, behind fences and in bushes. Volunteers near the lake where Sam was found sat in silence after hearing the news, before starting to sing the toddler's favourite song, 'Wheels on the Bus', Nine News reports. Divers were searching the lake near Sam's home on Tuesday, but returned on Wednesday to search again . Police cordoned off the area and were supporting the little boy's family. 'It is with great sadness that we provide this update.. We thank the community and SES volunteers for the strong support we received during the search for Sam,' WA Police said in a statement. Sam's grandfather Geoff earlier issued a plea for search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song, Perth Now reports. Police were also considering playing the song out loud to coax the two-year-old out if he has found a hiding space. 'It was a tough night,' Mr Trott said. 'Matthew (Sam's father) is beside himself. He is out on his bike searching this morning.' At least 100 extra State Emergency Services volunteers joined the search on Wednesday morning as police and search teams comb the streets, parks and bushland on foot and horseback. 'Our hearts go out to #SamTrott's family and the officers who recovered his little body from the lake. Devastating news,' WA's Police Union tweeted. It comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as search and rescue teams scoured the streets . Police dogs and the air wing unit were also been called in. 'Reminder to all, before you leave to work or leave your drive-ways to please check under, around and inside vehicles just in case Sam has crawled under or inside any of those places overnight,' WA Police said on Wednesday morning. Police also called on residents in neighbouring streets who may have CCTV cameras outside their homes to come forward. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, gave a statement on Tuesday afternoon pleading for people to help look for their little boy. 'Check your backyards, your frontyards, check your bushes ... he could be hiding in your garden,' Mr Trott said. 'He can be quite sociable but by the same token he could run away. If you see him and he runs away run after him, catch him please because we really need him to come home. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, say their little boy went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors . Sam's grandfather Geoff has asked search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song . 'If you've got little drains, you know, he's autistic, so he may not play with normal toys, so he could be hiding in the garden. 'He could be hiding somewhere, he could be wandering around he may well have got tired and laid down for a sleep.' Police have praised the community saying the help so far has been 'overwhelming'. Sam went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors. 'I heard the fridge door beep because he was in the fridge, I said 'shut the door Sam'. Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn't there,' Ms Trott told Perth Now. 'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore. 'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn't see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name. 'He doesn't know how to open doors but the door was wide open.' Hundreds of nearby residents joined the renewed search for little Sam on Wednesday . One hundred extra SES volunteers joined the search and trawled the streets near Sam's home . Rescue teams searched under bushes in case Sam had taken refuge underneath them . Just before 10am on Wednesday, volunteers and media were pushed back from the lake where Sam's body was subsequently recovered from . Hundreds of neighbours lined up early on Wednesday to volunteer to search for Sam . Hundreds of people have since taken to social media to express grief and pay tribute to Sam, his family and those involved in the search. 'My heart is broken. Such a tragic ending. Credit to all the Perth community and emergency services who put in such a tremendous effort to search for this gorgeous little boy, I feel very sad and overwhelmed,' Brittaney McCulloch posted on Facebook. 'The whole city cries with them. Rest peacefully little man. Deepest sympathy to Sam's family and all involved,' Kerrie Broun. Cidalia Francis: 'Sam, Sam, Sam....I never met you, but you have stolen my heart! Keep close to mummy, daddy and big brother. They need you right now. You are such a little adventurer and my big hero! Rest in peace angel.' WA Police briefed the residents who showed up to help looked for little Sam on Wednesday . Some residents even left out containers of food and water for the little boy in case he reappeared overnight . The land search and rescue operation is continuing on Wednesday with the assistance of State Emergency Service volunteers . Lakes surrounding the nearby school are also being combed by police divers with Sam known to like water . Police dogs and the air wing unit have also been called in as the desperate search continues . At least 100 State Emergency Services volunteers have joined the search on Wednesday morning as police and search teams comb  the area .

        "document": "By . Laura Cox . It is a matter Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have clearly discussed at some length in private. But their decision to make public their thoughts on assisted suicide and reveal details of a suicide pact they have made has led to one of television’s most popular couples dividing opinion and exposing themselves to criticism. After 26 years of marriage, the former presenters of ITV’s This Morning said they had made a ‘pledge’ to help one another if they were suffering and considered it the ‘responsibility’ of their partner, regardless of the consequences. Under fire: Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, pictured in Fowey, Cornwall, on Monday, were yesterday accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of 'promoting' suicide . Mr Madeley, 57, said he would not hesitate if his wife asked him to give her ‘a little push to go over the edge’ and Miss Finnigan said she would do the same. Under British law, a partner can be prosecuted if they help someone to die. Mr Madeley said he would spare his wife such a fate by joking that he would shoot himself in the head. ‘For me, it would be the locked room, the bottle of whisky and the revolver,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t want to mess around.’ Devoted: The couple, who have been married for 26 years and have two children together, said on Sunday that they had made a suicide pact if one of them would become seriously ill . Miss Finnigan, 65, was equally . forthright. ‘Stuff it all. We’ve made ourselves give each other a pledge . along those lines,’ she said. However, . they were accused by anti-euthanasia campaigners of ‘promoting’ suicide, with their celebrity status increasing the risk of copycat . agreements. Dr Peter Saunders of Care Not Killing said Mr Madeley’s revolver comment amounted to a breach of World Health Organisation guidelines about the discussion of suicide in the public sphere. The guidelines, which are intended to protect the vulnerable, state that celebrity endorsement is to be avoided and methods should not be discussed. Disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell, who  is against the legalisation  of assisted suicide, echoed  those concerns. While noting that the couple’s . decision was ‘entirely their own matter’, she added: ‘When it becomes . problematic is because they have a very prominent influence on people. Still going strong: The couple, pictured in 1993, have been married for 26 years . ‘They . have a massive following but what they’re not doing is thinking about . how their decisions may impact upon other people and the adverse effect . this could have on people. ‘They . have a very influential voice and the people who will suffer will be . those who are  vulnerable to influence and coercion. 'While everyone has a . right to an opinion, I don’t think what they’ve done is responsible.’ However, Dignity in Dying, which supports assisted suicide, welcomed the debate ignited  by the couple. ‘This . is a conversation that needs to be had and any discussion about it . going on in the public sphere is a positive thing,’ said a spokesman. The couple have two children together – Chloe and Jack – and Miss Finnigan has two sons from a previous marriage. They were last on TV screens regularly five years ago but remain well-known due to their book club, which is now in its tenth year. The couple, who became grandparents 18 months ago, revealed that they decided to confront the issue when Mr Madeley’s mother died last month. He said that although she had Alzheimer’s and lung cancer, her death came as a shock. Miss Finnigan added: ‘It’s just the shock of death. It is so final … I suspect that the closer you get to your own mortality, the more final it seems.’ Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges. Severely ill Britons are increasingly ending their lives by travelling to clinics abroad, such as Dignitas in Switzerland.",

The man accused of murdering April Jones was an 'emotional wreck' when he was arrested on suspicion of her abduction, a police officer told a jury today. Mark Bridger allegedly told PC Philip Saunders: 'I know what this is all about,' before 'confessing' to killing the five-year-old in a car accident, Mold Crown Court was told. In a conversation with police officers as he was taken to be interviewed, Bridger, 47, allegedly said he 'crushed' April with his 4x4 and 'there was no life in her, no pulse, no breathing, no response in her eyes'. Mark Bridger (left) allegedly 'confessed' to killing April Jones (right) in a car accident when he was arrested by officers on suspicion of her abduction, a jury was told today . The defendant wept throughout the evidence and, according to witnesses in the public gallery, April’s mother Coral left the court room in tears. Former slaughterhouse worker Bridger denies abducting and murdering April as she played near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, on the evening of October 1 last year. Giving evidence to the jury today, PC Saunders read from the notes he made after he detained Bridger as he walked along the A487 at 3.30pm on the next day. He said: 'I was travelling down the A487 with my sergeant who instructed me that if we saw Mark Bridger, he was to be arrested on suspicion of the abduction of April Jones. At approximately 3.30pm, I saw a male who matched his description. 'I stopped the car and asked him what his name was. He confirmed to me he was Mark Bridger and at that point I arrested him on suspicion of abduction and cautioned him.' The officer said Bridger replied: 'I know what this is all about.' April's parents Paul and Coral Jones arriving at Mold Crown Court earlier this week for the trial of Mark Bridger . He said the defendant went on: 'It was an accident, I crushed her with the car. I don’t know where she is. 'As I was going to drive away two girls on a bike came across me, I then got out and saw one girl lying under the car. 'I don’t know where is. I picked her up and put her in my car, which is left hand drive, and put her on the front seat.' PC Saunders said Bridger then told him 'he needed to talk'. The officer said: 'I interrupted Bridger and said he would be able to speak when we got to the police station at Aberystwyth, where he would be questioned.' But in the car, Bridger continued to talk, he said. Reading again from his notes, PC . Saunders told the jury Bridger said: 'I’ve been looking for her all . night and today on foot because my car is in the garage. 'My car is in Rob’s garage, this is in Machynlleth. It’s a Land Rover Discovery. I didn’t abduct her. 'I did my best to revive her. I panicked. The more I drove through the night, the more I got p****d. CCTV shows April Jones at a leisure centre just hours before her disappearance, which has been shown to the jury during the trial of Mark Bridger for the abduction and murder of the schoolgirl . 'My son and daughter play at their house. I didn’t even know until this morning who it was until I saw the TV. 'I just wish I knew what I’ve done with her, where I put her. I need to say sorry to the family. 'I can’t believe I didn’t just call an ambulance or the police. My intention was to head towards the hospital. 'There was no life in her, no pulse, no breathing, no response in her eyes. She was just on the seat. 'I tried to revive her using mouth and nose. When my hand went on her chest I knew there was a lot more to it. I did my best to revive her. 'I don’t remember having her in the car when I went back. I looked in all my rooms in my house. I wouldn’t have dumped her, she’s a human being. I wouldn’t have done that. 'The only place I haven’t checked is down by my house. It’s CJ Law yard. Caravans in there. I really don’t know where she is. I just want to know what I’ve done. The prosecution claims Bridger snatched and murdered April, who had cerebral palsy. Her body was never found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police . 'I had my daughter’s school meeting last night at 5pm. I don’t remember seeing girls play. I remember looking through my rear view window. I saw a girl with dark hair. I then felt the car rise up and down. 'My car was making a hell of a noise. When I looked there was a girl under the car. She had gone a funny colour, she was only a little thing. 'I remember being by the clock by Rob’s garage. I went numb, I don’t know what I was doing.' PC Saunders said: 'From the point of arrest, he was very emotional, crying. He seemed to be, what I would call, an emotional wreck.' The prosecution claims Bridger snatched and murdered April, who had cerebral palsy, in a sexually motivated attack. Her body was never found despite the largest search operation ever staged by British police. Earlier the jury heard evidence from one of the first police officers to arrive at Bridger’s home, Mount Pleasant in the hamlet of Ceinws, near Machynlleth. Detective Constable Sarah Totterdale said she and two colleagues were told to attend the address to search for April and arrest the defendant. She said she arrived at the isolated cottage shortly after 3pm. After trying the back door of the property and finding it locked and secured, the officers forced entry through the front door. She said: 'I walked into the porch area and into the living room and saw a log burner, glowing orange colour and the heat was noticeable. 'There was no sign of anybody at the address other than myself and my colleagues.' Walking upstairs she described the main bedroom as 'very untidy', with a mattress and clothes and a duvet sitting on the floor. She said she looked under the duvet and a colleague suggested she call out April’s name. 'If April was hiding she may respond to a female voice,' the officer said. 'I continued to call out April, April, April, but there was no response.' In the bathroom, she said she noticed a strong smell of washing powder. She could also smell Deep Heat and saw a bottle of the muscle treatment nearby. The jury today heard evidence from one of the first police officers to arrive at Bridger's home, Mount Pleasant in the hamlet of Ceinws, near Machynlleth . Asked further about the smells, she said: 'I can only describe it as washing powder and a chemical you would use to clean the floor. It was uncomfortably hot, I was perspiring and I only had a thin rain coat on. 'Whether the heat was making the smell stronger, I can’t say.' Earlier, Sophy Zlajic, an office clerk at Dyfi Autocraft in Machynlleth, told the jury that Bridger seemed 'upset and teary-eyed' when he discussed April’s disappearance with her on the morning of October 2. He had taken his 4x4 into the garage at 9.30am, she said in a statement read to the court by Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting. 'As a community, we were all upset but . he appeared visibly upset, on the verge of crying. He also said . something like \"My children used to play with her\".' - Sophy Zlajic, office clerk at Dyfi Autocraft in Machynlleth . Ms Zlajic said she recognised Bridger and his car as he had taken it to the garage two weeks earlier for an MoT. 'The car was making a grinding noise and I thought to myself that it didn’t sound good,' Ms Zlajic said. After Bridger got out of his vehicle, she said he told her: 'I’ve just heard. I haven’t got a TV or radio up there.' She said: 'I believed he was talking about the missing girl. He looked very upset and was teary-eyed when he said it. But he didn’t mention April by name.' She added that Bridger also commented that it was 'not the best time' for his car to break down as 'he could use it to help'. The witness said: 'I took it to mean the search for April. Again, he looked upset when he said this. 'As a community, we were all upset but he appeared visibly upset, on the verge of crying. He also said something like \"My children used to play with her\".' John Rowlands, a mechanic at the same garage, said in his statement that Bridger 'appeared nervous and edgy'. 'He kept looking around him and seemed on edge. I thought nothing of it at the time.' The trial was adjourned until 10.30am on Monday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

Kelly Noble, 34, took her five children with her to the family-friendly resort in Skegness, Lincolnshire, as a treat for her 14-year-old autistic son, Lewis, earlier this month. But just minutes after the children started playing in the pool on the second day of their holiday, a lifeguard ordered them to leave over health and safety fears. Scroll down for video . Kelly Noble, her son Lewis, 14 and her other children (l-r) Jonny Tougher 9, Jake Tougher 7, Kadee Mattley 5, Lishay Mattley, 10, were kicked out of a Butlin's swimming pool because she had 'too many children' Ms Noble was told that there were not enough adults to care for the children - Lewis, Jonny, nine, Jake, seven, daughter Lishay, 10, and stepdaughter Kadee, five, safely because she was on her own. Despite Ms Noble being within Butlin's rules by supervising a maximum of two children under the age of eight, a lifeguard insisted the five children had to get out of the water because of fears that she would not be able to care for her autistic son, as well as two under-eights. A furious Ms Noble said: 'We'd all been in the swimming pool on the first day, and the children had been saying how brilliant it was. 'They really wanted to go again the next day, so we went as soon as it opened at 10am. 'But after about 10 minutes, the lifeguard came up to me and asked if they were all my children. 'He said he was going to have to ask us to leave as their policy is to only have two children to one adult. 'I was really upset and so were the children - I practically had to pull them out of there kicking and screaming.' Ms Noble, from Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, arranged the trip through the charity Family Fund, which supports disabled children. The family were kicked out of the pool at Butlin's in Skegness on the second day of their holiday . And the family were dealt another blow when resort bosses told them they could not go on any fairground rides without extra supervision. Ms Noble was offered the 'Red Riders' service, where Butlins workers accompany the children on rides - but this is only offered for two hours a day. The devastated mother says she was then forced to pay £250 to keep the children entertained with other activities instead. She said: 'It just seemed like the last straw and I ended up crying on the phone to my mum. 'I spent £250 on keeping the children entertained in arcades - my mum had to transfer money over. 'The kids were irritable and didn't have a good time. It ruined our holiday. 'I understand the health and safety thing, but why did they let me book a holiday in the first place without any other adults? I wish I'd known sooner.' A spokesman for Butlins said: 'When guests book with us, our phone advisors make them aware of our policies regarding child supervision in our pools and fairgrounds. 'The same information is on our website. 'Our policy in our pools, which would mirror those of other public pools, is that every two children aged eight years old and under must be accompanied by at least one adult. 'The team felt that the older child with autism could not be provided with a realistic level of supervision. 'The safety of all our guests is our priority.'",

Sonia Gill, 27, is a poster girl in India, where she has starred in five blockbusters - as well as fashion shoots, TV commercials and soap adverts. But despite her increasing fame abroad, she refuses to ditch her regular 9-to-5 job at home in Oxford. Scroll down for video . Double life: Sonia Gill, 27, is a Bollywood poster girl (left) between shifts at Oxfordshire County Council (right) Star: The Oxford-born actress has starred in five movies after being scouted at university in Buckinghamshire . At the council, she works on the Blue Badge team - processing applications and issuing parking badges for people with mobility problems. And any film parts she gets will have to wait until she gets a holiday. She said: 'I actually enjoy both jobs. I enjoy working at the council - the people are really nice. I like talking to people so working in customer services, that’s an advantage. 'I love everything about India and I have really good friends over there. The weather is great and the lifestyle is really good. 'It’s totally different to here - I have someone doing my cooking and cleaning. But coming back to the UK brings me back to reality. It keeps me grounded. 'It’s actually quite good for me because I’m quite a private person.' Sonia's career began when a scout spotted photos of her on Facebook while she was a Law student at Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe, which lead to her modelling in Asian bridal magazines. Work: Sonia 'loves' her job in which she processes Blue Badge applications and issues disability permits . Secret: Sonia has yet to tell colleagues she flies all over the world for films like Let's Play The Game (pictured) Work: She spent two months intensively learning Hindi and now gets offered lead roles in romantic comedies . At 22, she was offered a role in Let’s Play The Game and she flew to New York and New Jersey to shoot the Indian film. Later, she was offered roles in Mumbai, including television adverts and fashion shows, before starring in movie Society. And last December she spent six weeks shooting romantic comedy Arsho in the Punjab region of India, which has recently been released in UK cinemas. Incredibly, she even learned Hindi. 'I did it in a couple of months. I just converse with the locals but I still have a British accent so that works against me. 'But every time I come back people say I have an Indian accent!' She added: 'I usually go to India for six months and do a lot of modelling and acting and the other six months I’m usually here because my family are here. 'I’m pretty well known over there because I do a lot of TV commercials and I’m the face of a soap called Santoor.' And Sonia has even kept her alter ego a secret from her co-workers. Alter ego: Looking ravishing in gold, this is Sonia at one of her premieres with her co-stars who work full time . 'Nobody at work knows what I do, well they didn’t until now,' she said. 'They’re quite excited. They had no idea. I was hiding it so it was quite a shock for them. I didn’t really want the attention because I’m quite shy.' She added: 'When we do dancing we have a lot of rehearsals. It’s quite tough. I’m not an experienced dancer but I love to dance. 'You get to do all sorts of different dances - one day you’re doing jazz, then you’re doing contemporary then Bollywood.' But despite her anonymity here, Sonia took her friends and family to watch her in action on the big screen. 'I just had a movie released two weeks ago called Arsho,' she said. 'My family and I watched if together in Leicester Square. 'My family and friends were really excited - they were shouting and screaming in the screen. They were pretty impressed. I don’t think they expected much from me!'",

Sentenced: Michael Eldin pictured arriving at Hull Crown Court where he was handed a suspended sentence for breaking Daniel Watson's ribs and colllarbone in an argument . A 20 stone man who crushed a drinker's ribs and broke his collarbone by sitting on him during a row in a pub garden has been spared jail. Michael Eldin, 47, was told by judges that he had used his weight as a 'weapon' to pin his victim, Daniel Watson, to the ground. Hull Crown Court heard that Eldin, who walks with a stick, had an argument with Mr Watson about his son in the garden of The Plough Inn in Snaith, East Yorkshire. The father-of-two grabbed Mr Watson by the throat and pinned him against some wooden patio railings before repeatedly banging the victim's head. When Mr Watson dropped to the ground, Eldin knelt on his 12 stone victim, breaking his ribs. Eldin was given a four month suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay £200 compensation to Mr Watson which will be deducted from his benefits over the next year. Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'All the evidence was on CCTV, it was very quick. 'He bashes his head against wooden railings five times and he kneels on his ribs. He is a large man and the complainant is very small.' Mr Watson suffered two broken ribs and a broken collarbone in the attack. Defending Eldin, Ian Phillip said: 'Both parties had been out drinking and the complainant accepts having more to drink. 'This is clearly out of character.' Eldin, from Snaith, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm on September 8 last year. The court heard his partner is not working and is in receipt of carer's allowance to care for Eldin. Judge John Dowse told Eldin a 20st man's weight would be 'equal to a weapon'.

'You pleaded guilty and this was, in any event, out of character for you. 'This was violence in the street and as such must be punished by a prison sentence. However, in the circumstances of this case that sentence will be suspended.' Judge Dowse warned Eldin to stay out of trouble or face the consequences.

        "document": "New York (CNN) -- If President Obama had been forthright last week at the health care summit, he would have opened the meeting by stating: \"If you have health coverage, under our reform bills you are going to pay more and get less. If you are one of the 45 million elderly or disabled people on Medicare, you are going to get less. There is no such thing as free medical care. Somebody has to pay!  And in the end it is you.\" Those are the facts! And as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated to the Republicans : \"...you're entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts.\" However, the facts, as the president has found out, are not exactly a compelling message to persuade a reluctant Congress and public to overhaul nearly one-fifth of the nation's economy. Adding 31 million people (45 million now don't have coverage) to the health care system will cost the taxpayers trillions over time. Many of that uninsured group can't afford health insurance, and if this legislation passes, the government will create an entitlement program to subsidize them. In the end, like the entitlement programs that have gone before them, they will far exceed any cost estimates on the table today. Just to remind you, Mr. President and members of Congress,  the taxpayers have a right to know the full fiscal consequences of this legislation. The United States is spending this year nearly $2.5 trillion on health care. That is 17.3 percent of the U.S. economy and it's rising at a rapid rate. We spent $134 billion more in the past year than in the year before. To put $2.5 trillion into perspective, that is more money than the federal government received in taxes and revenues this year. The problem is nobody knows (and especially the Congress) what a trillion dollars really means. A trillion is a million million. Still means nothing to most of us. If you spent a million dollars a day since the birth of Jesus Christ, it wouldn't even equal a trillion. If you stacked up a trillion dollars in dollar bills, it would reach 68,000 miles into the sky, about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Those numbers are too big for any of us. Somebody has to pay for the most expensive health care in the world. Many experts would argue it is also the very best health coverage in the world. Health care today is paid for by three entities. The government  (federal, state and local) pays more than 50 percent of the costs. That is us, the taxpayers. The insurance companies pay about one-third of the costs. That again is us. We pay the premiums and the insurance company pools the risk, and distributes our monies back for the medical services. They obviously add an overhead cost as does any business, but it's still our money being paid out. The third payer is again us. Out-of-pocket reimbursements or additional fees come directly out of our pocket and paycheck. Health care has changed as dramatically as anything in our society in the last half century.  First, we are living longer. In 2007, American men could expect to live 3.5 years longer and women 1.6 years longer than in 1990. We are long past the days when you walked into a doctor's office and the doctor -- armed only with a stethoscope, blood pressure monitor and a thermometer -- listened to our symptoms and made a diagnosis. Maybe in a rare case an X-ray was called for. We paid our bill and went to the drugstore and got our prescription.  There were no MRI's, no heart diagnostic tests, no CT scans or any of the wonder drugs that have extended our lives and in many cases made the quality better. It's not that people aren't seeing doctors. In the last several years, more than 1.2 billion annual visits to a physician's office have taken place, averaging more than three a year per person. Certainly, some efforts must be made to provide some insurance reform -- but that also means malpractice insurance reform. Some massive efforts need to be made to curb Medicare and insurance fraud. And efforts must be made to create more competition among insurance companies across state lines. The president's attempt to add some of the better suggestions from the Republicans addressing these issues is not going to add any support from that side of the aisle. They are minor changes that are positive but don't tackle the fundamental cost issues or address the new entitlements and mandates that Republicans object to most. Reducing costs in most cases means reducing services. Who doesn't want an MRI for their child injured in a car wreck? Who doesn't want tests done on a spouse or parent who has chest or abdominal pain? But if Reid and Pelosi shove this legislation through Congress against public opinion, they and their party will pay a price. Yet the price Democrats will pay at the polls in November won't be nearly as big a price as our kids and grandkids will pay when the bill comes through years hence. If you're going to have reform, make the system better. Take your time and do it right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.",

        "document": "By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 11:34 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 26 June 2013 . Trial: Magdalena Luczak (pictured), of Coventry, is accused of depriving Daniel Pelka of food . A mother accused of starving her four-year-old son before beating him to death was an aggressive drunk who threatened the boy's father with a knife, a court heard today. Magdalena Luczak, 27, and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, 33, of Coventry, are accused of depriving Daniel Pelka, of food, force-feeding him salt and locking him in a home-made prison. The toddler was so skinny he resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’ before he died from a head injury in March 2012, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Daniel's biological father Eryk Pelka said he regularly found Luczak drunk while looking after their son, and the pair would regularly argue - with her lashing out by hitting him over the face. He told the court she once threatened to stab him with a knife at a party, and he had to call the police. They met in Poland in 2004 then moved to Coventry a year later before Daniel was born. But their relationship deteriorated and he eventually left Britain to return to his native Poland when Daniel was aged one. Mr Pelka said he had ‘fierce arguments’ with Luczak. Speaking through a translator, he said: ‘They are only my thoughts but she was aggressive towards me. She was shouting and calling me names and she was trying to hit me as well.’ Mr Pelka said at a party in 2007 police had to be called after Luczak threatened him with a knife. He said: ‘We were at the party together and we had been drinking together. We were arguing all the time and she grabbed a knife. 'I rang the police and the police came and arrested both of us because I was drunk as well. I was pushing her away.’ Mr Pelka said Luczak would ‘repeatedly’ slap him across the face. He said on two occasions he had to call into work and pretend to be sick because Luczak had not come home from a night out. He also said he came home late from . his job as a lorry driver on at least two occasions and found her drunk. He said: ‘She was drunk and Daniel was lying on his own and no-one was . looking after him.’ The pair moved to Coventry in 2005 and shared various addresses before and after Daniel was born in December 2007. Hearings: A file sketch of Magdelena Luczak (right) and Mariusz Krezolek (left) at Birmingham Crown Court . Police were called to several domestic incidents involving the couple - sometimes by Mr Pelka and sometimes by Luczak. Mr Pelka denied ever being violent towards his ex-partner. Daniel, who was so badly starved he weighed just 1.5st - 15lbs below average - was found by horrified paramedics with a head injury on March 3 last year. Earlier in the trial the court heard his levels of emaciation were like those seen in parts of Africa and his Body Mass Index was too low to even register on the scale. Despite being rushed to University Hospital Coventry doctors were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead. Mr Pelka told the jury when he left England to return to Poland, Daniel was ‘really chubby’. He said: ‘He was as all normal children are, he was healthy, he was not neglected. Even his granny said that taking into consideration he had been drinking English milk, he's really chubby.’ Toddler death: Daniel Pelka was so skinny he resembled a 'concentration camp victim' before he died . The jury also heard from Grzegorz Lukasik, a former colleague of Krezolek at an automotive factory in Coventry. He said Krezolek had described Daniel as 'autistic' and said he did not respond to beatings because of his mental condition. At the trial: Eryk Pelka, biological father to Daniel Pelka, leaves Birmingham Crown Court after giving evidence today . He said: ‘I remember he said that he [Daniel] had autism and it's not even worth beating him because he won't feel any pain because he's autistic. I have never heard any good words about Daniel.’ Meanwhile the court also heard that Mr Pelka broke up with the boy's mother after she cheated on him with one of his friends. He said that he and Luczak's relationship had deteriorated after she found a new partner - who had been living with the couple at the time. He said: ‘I was sick and tired of the arguments and the cheating.  I found out Magdalena had cheated on me with on of my mates. ‘When I left our relationship was not very good, Magdalena already had a new partner. Their relationship started just before I left England but I can't remember exactly when it was. ‘I got up once and went upstairs and Magdalena just told me about it. He lived with us at the time.’ Mr Lukasik, who worked with Krezolek, said Daniel's stepfather had spoken of sending the youngster 'back to Poland'. He said: ‘He mentioned they would like to send him to his biological father but because there's a very strong bond between Magdalena and Daniel it probably won't happen.’ Lead investigator Detective Inspector Chris Hanson, of West Midlands Police, said when he examined Daniel's body on a mortuary slab the little boy's body was in a ‘wretched state’. DI Hanson, who has investigated 80 child deaths over 21 years, said the schoolboy's hair fell out when he inspected the corpse. He said: ‘I was pretty shocked actually, I would describe him as grotesquely thin. His body was in a completely wretched state and I was completely shocked at the severity of his emaciation. ‘His appearance was akin to a child from famine-affected Africa. He was very pale. Even wearing plastic gloves I could feel that his hair was very frail and brittle.’ DI Hanson said Daniel's hair had fallen out when he inspected his skull. He said: ‘I could also see to the back of his head there was a swelling. I felt the injury and I instantly suspected it was a subdural [brain] bleed. It was obvious to me Daniel had been murdered.’ Krezolek and Luczak have admitted child cruelty, but deny charges of murder and causing or allowing Daniel’s death. The trial continues.

        "document": "Autism may be caused by a missing gene, it has emerged. A team of scientists at Leeds University set out to investigate the gene neurexin-II, building on past research that has found some people diagnosed with autism are deficient in the gene. Mice who were deficient in the gene were found to display symptoms similar to autism in humans, including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice. Dr Steven Clapcote, of Leeds University, who led the study said: 'In other respects, these mice were functioning normally. The gene deficiency mapped closely with certain autism symptoms. 'This is exciting because we now have an animal model to investigate new treatments for autism.' Scroll down for video . Scientists found mice deficient in a gene called neurexin-II showed similar symptoms to autism in humans, including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice. They hope this could help model treatments (file pic) The researchers also looked at how the absence of neurexin-II affects the brain. 'We found that the affected mice had lower levels of a protein called Munc18-1 in the brain,' said co-author Dr James Dachtler, also of Leeds University. Munc18-1 usually helps to release neurotransmitters - chemicals that take signals across the gaps between cells in the brain called synapses. Lower levels of Munc18-1 mean the release of neurotransmitter chemicals could be impaired in the affected mice, and possibly in some cases of autism in humans, he said. Previous research established a link between the symptoms of autism and neuroligin-1, another gene associated with carrying signals across synapses. The Leeds-led study is the first to find a connection with neurexin-II. Dr Clapcote said: 'Not all people with autism will have the neurexin-II defect, just as not all will have the neuroligin defect, but we are starting to build up a picture of the important role of genes involved in these synapse communications in better understanding autism.' The study was published in the journal Translational Psychiatry. People with autism may gather information from faces in a different way to their peers, which scientists believe could explain why they gain different perceptions from faces. The discovery could help improve understanding of those diagnosed with autism, helping family members, friends and healthcare workers better communicate with them. Canadian researchers recruited 71 people, 33 people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 33 people without the disorder. The participants were presented 36 pairs of photographic and synthetic images of emotionally neutral faces. They were asked to indicate which faces appear 'kind' to them. People with autism may process information and gather clues about people's faces differently, a study found (file pic) With the photographic images, the judgements of the participants with ASD were mixed compared to the participants without the disorder. But the two groups made identical judgments about the synthetic images. The identical results suggest it is not the judgement process itself that is different in people with ASD, but the way they gather clues in the first place. 'The evaluation of an individual's face is a rapid process that influences our future relationship with the individual,' said the study's lead author Baudouin Forgeot d'Arc, of the University of Montreal. 'By studying these judgments, we wanted to better understand how people with ASD use facial features as cues. Do they need more cues to be able to make the same judgment?' He added: 'We now want to understand how the gathering of cues underpinning these judgments is different between people with or without ASD depending on whether they are viewing synthetic or photographic images. 'Ultimately, a better understanding of how people with ASD perceive and evaluate the social environment will allow us to better interact with them.'",

He has told how, as a boy, people dismissed him as thick because of his severe dyslexia. Which only makes it even more remarkable that Jamie Oliver has just been named as Britain’s second biggest-selling author since records began – with total book sales of £126 million. The Essex-born television chef and school meals campaigner, who has sold more than 10 million cook books, is ranked second only to Harry Potter author J K Rowling. Cooking up a fortune: Jamie Oliver, pictured with his wife Jools, has come second in the list of the top 50 most valuable authors compiled by The Bookseller . Ms Rowling’s seven books about the boy wizard have generated sales of more than  £237.6 million.The newly released sales figures have been compiled by The Bookseller – the publishing industry’s trade magazine. It has drawn up lists of Britain’s 50 most successful authors and the country’s 50 biggest-selling titles. Father-of-four Oliver, 37, who is famous . for his ‘Pukka’ catchphrase and whose bestsellers include The Naked . Chef and Jamie’s 30 Minute Meals, is joined on the bestseller list by . some of his culinary rivals. Delia Smith is in tenth place, Nigella Lawson is ranked 19th and Gordon Ramsay is towards the bottom of the chart at 45. Together, the four chefs account for 40 per cent of all the cook books sold  in Britain since records began in 1998. The success of the chefs is due in no small part to the fact that all four have fronted high-profile  TV shows – and other television personalities and celebrities also feature strongly in the list. Most valuable: Harry Potter author JK Rowling topped the list put together by The Bookseller . They include Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who is ranked at 24, television gardener and chatshow host Alan Titchmarsh at 42, and former Page 3 girl Katie Price, who is 46th. Perhaps most surprising is the presence of Richard Parsons, the author of bestselling GCSE study guides, at No 8. Publishers have long known that sex sells and the charts also reflect the runaway success of the Fifty Shades Of Grey series of erotic novels which have sold more than 8.9 million copies in less than a year. E L James, the British author of the books who was unknown this time last year, is now Britain’s 26th most successful writer,  ahead of more established  favourites such as Wilbur Smith and Josephine Cox. Fifty Shades Of Grey, the first instalment of her trilogy, has sold more than 3.9 million copies and is currently seventh on the list of bestsellers. That puts it narrowly ahead of its sequels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, which are ranked 13th and 14th. But American writer Dan Brown’s 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code is still the country’s biggest-selling book, having sold more than 5.2 million copies. Brown himself is the sixth most successful author. Stieg Larsson, the Swedish author of the Millennium series of novels, which were published posthumously, is ranked at No 36 with sales worth more than £32 million. Several of Britain’s most celebrated novelists including Ian McEwan, the author of Atonement, and Birdsong writer Sebastian Faulks also feature. Faulks, who is ranked 35, has sold 4.6 million books since 1998 and is only narrowly ahead of McEwan on 4.5 million. Children’s literature, remains a potent sales force. As well as Rowling, the prolific Enid Blyton – author of Noddy, the Famous Five and many other story series – is at No 37. Meanwhile Tracey Beaker creator Jacqueline Wilson, War Horse author Michael Morpurgo and Roger Hargreaves the creator of the Mr Men stories are also in  the Top 50. Noticeable by their absence are classic works such as Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Pride And Prejudice by Jane Austen. The Bookseller believes this is partly because they achieved the bulk of their sales before 1998.",

'The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff' Greg Lukianoff, FIRE advocate . His wife Lynn has supported him during his appeal to the decision and his lawyers say he has been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’. Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post. She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work. This can be seen in a detailed letter he wrote to the Oakland Post student paper in January 2010, showing a strong understanding of the subject. Likeness: He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island . Compared: Hot for Teacher by Van Halen, pictured, was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band, which became famous for its bizarre video . ‘This is a wild overreaction to a student's creative writing,’ FIRE President Greg Lukianoff, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said. 'The real issue is the First Amendment. It's about academic freedom and about due process' Joseph Corlett . ‘The university has essentially issued a straightjacket to every writing student to protect the delicate sensibilities of faculty and staff.’ Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld. Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.

        "document": "A controversial decision to cut the benefits of a man who later starved to death was wrong, the Government admitted today. Mark Wood, 44, weighed just five-and-a-half stone when he died after staff from Government contractor Atos assessed him as being fit to work - despite suffering from more than seven disabilities and illnesses, including Asperger's syndrome. His income was cut to just £40 a week in March last year and he was ordered find employment. He died just five months later. Tragic: Mark Wood (left) in a healthier state before his benefit cut, and (right) after, having lost weight. He was 44 when he died weighing just five-and-a-half stone. His GP said the benefit cut 'pushed him before he died' Today a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions confessed the decision was wrong, sparking an internal review. It comes just two days after it emerged Atos is to quit its £500million contract early following Government criticisms. Mr Wood's GP Nicolas Ward has blasted the Government-backed contrator for 'pushing him' before he died. Speaking at an inquest into his patient's death, he said: 'Something pushed him or affected him in the time before he died and the only thing I can put my finger on is the pressure he felt he was under when his benefits were removed.' He added that he was an extremely vulnerable and fragile individual who was struggling to cope with life. Mr Wood, from Bampton, Oxfordshire, had suffered for years from obsessive compulsive disorder, Asperger's syndrome, phobias of food, pollution, paint fumes, and social situations, and cognitive behavioural problems. However, in March last year Atos insisted he was fit to work. Scandal: The Government's call for an urgent review into Atos comes two days after the firm announced it will end its £500million contract early following a stream of criticism . Prime Minister David Cameron described the case in his constituency as 'tragic' before backing an urgent investigation into Atos. But Mr Wood's grieving family have blasted the Government's announcement as a 'hollow victory' as it will not bring him back. His sister, Cathie Wood, said the announcement was a hollow victory because it would not bring him back. 'We are pleased but sad,' said 48-year-old Cathie. Asperger's syndrome is a form of autism, often referred to as a 'hidden disability'. It affects how a person makes sense of the world, hampering their social communication, social interaction and social imagination. There is no treatment for the condition and very little research on medication that is used by sufferers. Most people with Asperger's are prescribed a programme of behavioural therapy. 'They have reversed the decision - that is huge but they obviously had the information at their disposal to make the right decision and if they had done that last March Mark would not be dead. 'It is good because it hopefully means we can now get some answers.' Ms Wood and her mother Jill Gant appealed against the benefit cut earlier this month, acting on advice from Oxfordshire Welfare Rights (OWR). Today, they received a letter from the DWP saying it had 'revised' its decision to cut Mr Wood's benefits. A spokesman said: 'The coroner attributed Mr Wood's eating disorder and food phobia as the likely cause of his death, rather than his benefits being stopped. 'However, after receiving new evidence from Mark Wood's GP which was not presented at the first assessment, we have revised our original decision. 'We have written to Mr Wood's family about this decision and are carrying out an internal review.' Atos made £111.76m pounds operating profit in 2013. Ms Wood added: 'I think it is good that Atos has withdrawn but it is only part of the story - the whole system needs to be looked at.' Suzy Drohan, joint manager of OWR, said: 'Mr Wood lived in Cameron's constituency and this happened. 'We . are very sorry this had had to come to light from his death. There . could be other cases in which people have died too. We know there are . hundreds of decisions which are not right.' 'Tragic': David Cameron has spoken out about the 'tragic' case in his constituency and backed a review . Between January 2012 and January this year OWR took 312 cases to appeals against DWP decisions and 281 were successful. Mr Cameron said: 'This is a tragic case and my thoughts are with Mr Wood's family at this difficult time.' The decision means the family doesn't have to take the appeal to court. Nicola Blackwood, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said: 'This has been a tragic case and while this decision will not bring Mark back at least it sets the record straight. 'I have been very clear with the DWP that, in my view, Mark's case was badly mishandled by Atos and that the family's appeal needed to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and I am pleased they agreed. 'I also welcome Thursday's announcement that the Government's contract with Atos to conduct these assessments has been terminated early.' Atos refused to comment opn the reversed decision.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- After playing college football, working as a financial aid adviser and earning a master's degree, 25-year-old Andrew Fuller is back in high school. Fuller is a new teacher at Tri-Cities High School in East Point, Georgia. He made the move from Oregon to Georgia to join Teach for America, a non-profit organization that recruits non-traditional teachers to improve education for children in low-income communities. Fuller's passion for education stems from his own experience growing up. He was in a special education program from kindergarten to his senior year, and he felt stigmatized and overlooked. \"I never knew why. I never knew my disability,\" Fuller says. \"I never had an IEP, which is an individualized education program. I never had any of those things.\" \"Just being in the classroom and just knowing that I'd been given up on sometimes, that I'm not receiving the work, it was heartbreaking,\" he says. A gifted athlete, Fuller was accepted to the University of Oregon on a football scholarship. He later transferred and finished his college career playing for the Portland State Vikings. \"At Portland State is where I began a foundation and vision, knowing football is not the only thing that I'm good at but I'm also good at being a student,\" Fuller says. \"That's why I began to put in the work as a student, taking that football mentality of working hard every day and lifting weights to the classroom and starting to train my mind.\" Having found success off the field, Fuller's goal shifted from playing in the pros to giving back to children who are like he was. He continued his education at Portland State, earning a master's degree in special education. Then he applied to Teach for America. \"I felt that I wanted to be involved in the most high-need school but also have the backing of an organization that stood for what I embodied, which was: close the educational achievement gap,\" he says. Teach for America began in 1990 after founder Wendy Kopp proposed the idea in her senior thesis at Princeton University as a way to address educational inequality in the United States. The basic concept is to recruit highly successful individuals, often recent college graduates, to commit at least two years to teaching in a low-income community. \"Across the country what we are seeing in our low-income communities, unfortunately, is poverty oftentimes predicts destiny and where kids can go,\" says Shyam Kumar, the executive director of Teach for America in Metro Atlanta. He adds that \"attracting the most promising leaders into these classrooms is difficult.\" Unlike Fuller, most participants, called corps members, did not study education. Many had never even considered education as a career before joining Teach for America. Rather, the movement looks for \"a substantial set of traits that make them do amazing things in the classrooms and take kids and put them on a path to a much higher life opportunity,\" Kumar says. \"Some of those things are achievement ... strong track records of leadership, organizational abilities, and just this relentless drive if you hit a problem you're going to be able to overcome it.\" Once accepted, corps members attend a summer training institute before the school year starts to get them ready for the classroom. Jared Gourrier was an American Studies major at Union College in Schenectady, New York. Now he is in his second year teaching third-graders at Deerwood Academy in Atlanta, and he coaches football at Coan Middle School with two other corps members. \"For me, seeing that reality that a life can pretty much be determined by the third grade, it really made me care and understand so much more,\" he says. \"I have this unwavering dedication to it now.\" As a first generation college graduate, Mini'imah Shaheed says she \"definitely thought that college meant that you did something else beyond teaching.\" \"I had planned to do research and was planning to continue straight on into grad school and earn a Ph.D.,\" she says. She applied to the program after a Teach for America alum visited her campus, and she was accepted into the 2001 Atlanta corps. After her stint in the program she moved into administration, and today is in her first year as founding principal at KIPP STRIVE Primary School in Atlanta. \"Ideally, none on my students ever have to experience the achievement gap, based on the work that we do every day,\" Shaheed says. \"I'm still taking with me the mission of ensuring educational equity, but now I get to do it from the earliest grade level possible.\" The Teach for America model is not without its critics. In a list attached to a letter to Congress, the National Educators Association wrote, \"Teach for America does not include a sufficiently rigorous teacher preparation program, nor does it yield retention rates that warrant a federal investment in the program,\" two points often cited by opponents of the program. Teach for America says that 66% of its corps members remain in the field of education after their initial commitment, but that does not always mean they stay on as teachers. \"There's the first half of the movement, which is really getting strong teachers,\" Kumar says. \"But there's a second half, which is continue to keep many of these folks in the classrooms but then also build this leadership force to be principals and superintendents and policymakers.\" As for Fuller, he does not intend to remain in the classroom long-term but says his Teach for America experience is still vital to the impact he wants to have in the future. His goal is to become a principal and then a U.S. senator, addressing educational issues through national policy. \"I never want to lead anybody or teach anybody anything I've never done before, and so I don't want to be in the classroom or be in a leadership position telling my teachers how to teach,\" he says. \"And so being in the classroom will show me what the teachers need.\"",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 15:02 EST, 6 October 2011 . Almost half of the U.S. population now lives in a household where at least one member receives government benefits, new Census data has revealed. Analysis during the first quarter of 2010 found that a worrying 48.5 per cent of people lived in households that were dependent on state handouts. The figure is considerably higher than in the third quarter of 2008, at the height of the recession, when it stood at 44.4 per cent. President Barack Obama seen here at his White House press conference on Thursday morning, again urged Congress to pass his jobs bill, which would extend benefits . The rise has been blamed on high . unemployment, poor recovery from the recession, and an increase in the . number of government programmes. Rise of the benefits: Nearly half of Americans receive some form of support - a record high . Part of Obama's jobs plan, which he again pushed on Thursday in an hour-long press conference, would further extend jobless benefits. Obama said Congress needs to pass his $447billion bill quickly to 'guard against another downturn' in the economy. 'There is no doubt the economy is weaker now than it was at the beginning of the year,' Obama said as he called his plan an 'insurance policy against a double-dip recession.' Meanwhile laid-off workers and aging baby . boomers are believed to be flooding Social Security's disability program with benefit . claims, pushing the financially strapped system toward the brink of . insolvency. The Census found that 14.5 per cent of people in the U.S. shared a home with a person on Medicare, and 16 per cent lived with someone on Social Security. But it was means-tested programmes that accounted for the most highly utilised, with 34.2 per cent of the population receiving support from food stamps, subsidised housing and healthcare support from Medicaid. A graph from the Census Bureau shows the recent, explosive growth of people living on government benefits . Compare that with 15.1 per cent of Americans who were below the federal poverty line - $22,000 a year for a family of four. Applications for means-tested programs are up . nearly 50 percent over a decade ago as people with disabilities lose . their jobs and can't find new ones in an economy that has shed nearly 7 . million jobs. Meanwhile, 71 per cent of people say the biggest problem with the welfare system is that too many people receive benefits, according to a poll released in August. The stampede for . benefits is adding to a growing backlog of applicants many wait two . years or more before their cases are resolved. But a trend that will further worry the government, is that as the number of people receiving benefits is rising, so is the number of people exempt from paying tax. Family affair: 46.4 per cent of American households will pay no federal income support this year . And almost half of all households - . 46.4 per cent - will pay no federal income tax this year, according to . the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In 2007, the year the recession began, that figure was 39.9 per cent. GOP presidential candidates have used this detail to canvass that too . many Americans are not paying their fair share. Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann made the point in July, while former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and Texas Governor Rick Perry have called for the number of people paying income tax to be higher as well. Reflection of the times? William H. Macy stars with Allison Janney and Emmy Rossum on the U.S. version of the British show Shameless. Macy plays an alcoholic family patriarch living on disability benefits . Most of the people not paying income tax will be affected by payroll tax, though. Just 18.1 per cent of households, predominantly the nationâ€™s elderly and poorest families, pay neither payroll nor federal income taxes. Earlier this year President Obama had considered changes to social security and Medicare in an attempt to raise the debt ceiling. Those ideas were tabled.",

The reality TV star – real name Deirdre Kelly – defiantly insisted, ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister or his government stops her. The 42-year-old star of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street has repeatedly claimed that she is too depressed to work. Scroll down for video . Earning power: Benefits Street star White Dee has revealed that she is earning money from her new found fame while continuing to claim Government handouts . Jaunt: White Dee during her recent trip to Magaluf. She said the shots she was seen downing were water . But this weekend the mother of two, . whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a . year, admitted cashing in on her growing celebrity status and enjoying . the high life through a string of appearances and promotional work. She . was pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner . at a top restaurant. Miss Kelly, who was diagnosed with depression, . gets £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – . formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child . Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit. Up front: The mother-of-two, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, said she is declaring all her earnings to the authorities . ‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said. Her . last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – . and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000. Last . night Conservative MP Philip Davies called on the Department for Work . and Pensions (DWP) to investigate her case. ‘I think she epitomises . everything that’s wrong with our benefits system,’ he said. Following . the popularity of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families . on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six . offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France. She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham. She . has dined out at the city’s upmarket Malmaison hotel brasserie and is . reported to have agreed a big-money deal to appear on the next Celebrity . Big Brother. Miss Kelly told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Yes, I am taking . casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as . much as people think.’ Speaking . of a promotional trip to Magaluf earlier this month, she said: ‘I met a . lot of nice people but it can be hard trying to smile all the time when . you’re not in the mood for it. I missed my kids.’ In . exchange for the break, she says, she agreed to be the special guest at . a pool party, judge a wet T-shirt contest and go on a bar crawl to . promote a travel firm. Earlier this year Ms Kelly was sent on a date by a third party to the four-star Malmaison Hotel in Birmingham . Despite being on benefits, Ms Kelly dined out at the brassiere restaurant where main courses cost up to £20 . But she said: ‘The pool party was not really my scene and I don’t drink, so the bar crawl was not my thing either.’ She said the shot glasses she was photographed downing were filled with water. ‘I . wouldn’t say I was miserable, but that doesn’t mean I am not depressed. I’m on sickness benefit and trying to get back into full-time work. Background: During Benefits Street, Dee said she had suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and bad days' with the condition . ‘Do I have to stop claiming benefits because I spent two days in Majorca? ‘Would people be less upset if I went to Skegness?’ Miss . Kelly’s agent Barry Tomes said yesterday that not all the work she has . done has been paid, and any payment she has received is declared to the . relevant authorities. The . DWP said it would not discuss individual claimants but added: ‘Where . there is evidence of benefit fraud, we would not hesitate to . investigate.’ People are entitled to claim  Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if their illness or disability affects their ability to work provided they are aged under 65 and not receiving Statutory Sick Pay,  Statutory Maternity Pay or Jobseeker’s Allowance. The handouts are designed to help people back into the world of work, and it is possible to apply for ESA if you’re employed, self-employed, unemployed or a student on Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment. To get ESA, claimants usually have to prove they cannot work by sending in medical certificates to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Receipt of ESA is usually not affected if the person claiming works less than 16 house a week and earns less than £101 a week for up to a year, but if this limit is reached then the money may be withdrawn or reduced. The DWP must be notified of any change of circumstances, including if volunteer work is being carried out, and failure to do so may result in a claimant being investigated by the DWP, or even prosecuted for fraud.

A schoolgirl who penned a guide to dealing with her mother's epilepsy is celebrating after becoming a published author - aged just seven. Talented Layla Reid wrote her 'Epilepsy Book for Kids' as a guide to help children cope with an epileptic parent's seizures, after witnessing her own mother's fits. Sarah Reid suffers from terrifying absence seizures, where she appears to be in a deep daydream. Literary star: Layla Reid, 7, with her Epilepsy Book for Kids, a guide to coping with a parent's epileptic seizures . When Layla showed her book to Bristol publisher John Adler, he was so impressed that he agreed to print it free of charge, and give her a share of the profits. The book is now on sale in major stores including Waterstones, priced at £6.50. The budding writer said of her work: 'I hope it helps some other children so that they know what to do if their mummy has a fit.' Mrs Reid, 31, has suffered from seizures since she was Layla's age, and couldn't be prouder of her daughter's initiative. She hopes the book will prove a valuable resource for children coping with a parent's epilepsy. She said: 'I'm so proud of her, I never thought in a million years it would be published. Couldn't be prouder! Mother Sarah Reid, 31, hopes her daughter's book will reassure and inform children . 'I always wanted to be a writer when I was younger, but it's just one of those things isn't it. 'I really hope she can help a lot of children and let them know they are not alone. 'It’s great to have her raising awareness and helping other kids. It could end up being a life-saver for someone. 'I think she has had to grow up quite quickly because of my epilepsy. She’s a clever girl. We’re so proud of her.' Educational: The book is written in Layla's handwriting, and in a simple, child-friendly style . Amazingly, the entire book was produced in just one evening. Written in Layla's handwriting, it includes straightforward tips that children can easily follow - such as moving dangerous objects out of the way if someone starts fitting. It also features her own illustrations. The guide came about after Mrs Reid tried and failed to find a child-friendly book which could explain epilepsy. Dreaming of the future: Layla says her next project will be a story about her baby sister, and the things they will do together when she's older . When she realised there was hardly any information for children, Layla came up with the idea of writing a guide for other kids - so they know what to do if they witness an epileptic fit. Self-confessed bookworm Layla plans to keep up her writing, and hopes this will be the first of many stories. The seven-year-old says her next venture will be a tale about her baby sister Lauren, who arrived five weeks ago. 'I’m very happy to have a new sister, and I’m very proud,' she said. 'I want to write a story about all the things we’ll do together for when she’s older.' Layla's teachers have noticed a . massive improvement in her writing and enthusiasm for schoolwork since . she wrote the Epilepsy Book for Kids. 'We hope she’ll encourage some other children in her class to start writing too,' her mother said. Young though she is, Layla has already set her heart on a career in education. 'I want to be a teacher,' she says, 'because it’s a job where you get to do reading and writing and that’s what I want to do.'",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A Michigan teenager . who wanted to raise awareness about cerebral palsy by walking 40 miles . with his younger brother strapped to his back battled heat, rain, . fatigue and more to finish the trek Sunday. Hunter . Gandee, 14, had been planning for weeks to pull off the walk, hoping to . put a face on the muscular disorder that prevents his 7-year-old . sibling, Braden, from being able to walk without help. But all his . organizing couldn't prepare him for the conditions he faced as he packed . the 50-pound boy over two days. He even thought about giving up along the way. Scroll down for video . Incredible: 14-year-old Hunter Gandee walked 40 miles with his 7-year-old brother Braden Gandees on his back . Swagger: The walk was called the 'Cerebral Palsy Swagger' to raise awareness about the disease that affects Braden . 'Honestly, . yes, there was a point that we did consider stopping,' Hunter said. 'Braden's legs - the chafing was getting pretty bad. We did have to . consider stopping. It was at about the 30-mile point.' A phone call changed all that. Hunter . reached out to a friend, who said a prayer for the brothers. That, . combined with some rest and a change in how Braden was positioned on his . brother's back, helped the boys make it the final 10 miles. It . may have taken a bit longer than they anticipated, but the Gandees and . more than a dozen of their family members and friends strolled up a . winding road Sunday toward the University of Michigan's wrestling . center. At the top of the hill, Hunter lifted . up Braden so he could touch a 'Go Blue' banner erected for them near the . walk's endpoint. The move was met with thunderous applause and cheers . from those who had gathered to see the boys finish the trek. Tough: The boy's almost had to stop because of chafing on Braden's legs caused by the way he was situated on his brother's back, but the tough 7-year-old powered through it . Asked how he felt, Braden replied simply: 'Tired.' Hunter said he was 'more tired than I think I've ever been. My legs are pretty sore. But we pushed through it. And we're here.' More . than 30 hours earlier, Hunter, with Braden securely strapped to his . back, left the parking lot of Bedford Junior High in Temperance near the . Ohio border. Just before their Saturday morning departure, well-wishers . packed the gym for a send-off and the school band performed. The boys' parents and two other siblings accompanied them on the walk. A caravan of cars and other walkers also joined in. The . goal of the walk, called the Cerebral Palsy Swagger, was to raise . awareness about cerebral palsy and hopefully inspire new ideas for . mobility aides and medical procedures. Braden typically uses a walker, braces or a power chair to get around.

        "document": "(CNN) -- A dinner out turned into an experience of a lifetime for a North Carolina family thanks to one stranger's heartfelt gesture. Ashley England and her family want to thank a customer who paid for their meal Friday night and left behind a touching note about their special needs son. A photo of the note has gone viral, shared with thousands of people on Facebook. England told CNN her family, including husband, Jason, 8-year-old son Riley, 4-year-old brother Logan, the boys' grandmother and their great-grandmother were together at the Stag & Doe restaurant in China Grove, North Carolina, for a family meal when their special needs son, Riley, started to get frustrated. He was hungry and couldn't get the Netflix on his mom's phone to work. The waitress, the autistic girl and the broken hamburger . Since Riley suffers from epilepsy and is non-verbal, England said, it's hard for him to communicate and he screams and acts out when he's frustrated. England said he started to make screaming noises, beat on their table and threw her phone, catching the attention of some nearby customers. Although a few customers were looking, it wasn't the worst experience her family has had out in public since Riley's condition was diagnosed when he was a toddler, England said. But she was frustrated, she said, and in the past few weeks it has been really tough controlling Riley's behavior. So what happened next was just what the family needed. Autism, dining out and a side of kindness . As their waitress was delivering food to the family's table, England noticed another waitress, Tonya Griffin, walk up with a few tears in her eyes. She passed along a message from another customer that the England family says they will never forget. Griffin told the family, \"your meal's been paid for and he wanted me to give you this note.\" The note written on a customer's order slip read, \"God only gives special children to special people.\" England told CNN the gesture was really needed and it made her cry. \"I just broke down, the past month has just been so hard.\" She added, \"He just doesn't know what we've been going through and how much it was needed at the moment.\" When England updated her Facebook page about the family's experience Friday night, she ended it with this message: \"Dear stranger, thank you for giving me a blessing tonight in a way you will never know.\" England says she will be back at the restaurant when it reopens Wednesday -- its hours are 4 to 10 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday -- in hopes she can find the man to thank him personally. Canadians paying the coffee forward -- by the hundreds .",

        "document": "Vaccine: An American couple have been awarded more than £600,000 by a U.S court after claiming their son developed autism as a result of the MMR jab (file picture) Parents who claim their 10-year-old boy developed autism as a result of being injected with an MMR vaccine when he was a baby have been awarded more than £600,000 in a landmark court decision in America. Saeid and Parivash Mojabi claimed that son Ryan suffered a ‘severe and debilitating injury to his brain’ after being administered with two measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations in December, 2003 and in May the following year. They said in court papers that Ryan was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The ruling comes months after a judge in Italy awarded £140,000 to an Italian couple who said their son had autism after his routine childhood MMR inoculation. The American decision - although it doesn’t lay fault for the child’s disability with the drug - fuels anti-MMR campaigners challenging the view of the majority of the medical profession that holds the vaccinations are safe. The claim was against the US government which set up a Vaccine Programme. Although a judgement rules whether or not each case is eligible for compensation and the amount - in this case against the US Health Department - it does not apportion blame. The San Jose, California, based family took their case to the US Court of Federal Claims in 2006. Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programme, parents can petition the US government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines. A judgement in Ryan’s case, which was first filed in 2006, was made on December 13 last year by the Office of Special Masters set up by US Congress to decide on compensation claims. The defendant in the case was the US Secretary of Health and Human Services. The damages payment takes into account the boy’s future loss of earnings because it’s unlikely he will be able to work. In statements to the court, Ryan’s grandmother Paravaneh Shah-Mohammadi and his aunt Pooran Vahabi told how the boy appeared ‘lethargic’, ‘hardly responsive to noises and people around him,’and ‘unable to hold himself upright’ after having the first MMR vaccination. Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programme, parents can petition the US government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines (file picture) The number of autism cases in the UK has soared over the past four decades. At the last count researchers found one in 64 British children have some kind of autistic condition. In the Eighties, only four in every 10,000 children showed any signs of autism. The Department of Health and NHS doctors insist that better diagnosis of autism and environmental factors are responsible for the dramatic rise in the number of cases and dismissed MMR vaccinations as a cause. No link between the jabs and autism has been found in the British courts. In America, nearly 5,000 families blame the MMR injection for causing their children’s autism. Boost: The case is likely to fuel the arguments of anti-MMR campaigners (file picture) In 2008, a girl called Hannah Poling was awarded £1 million damages by the US government when a court ruled that receiving nine vaccines in one day, including the MMR, had caused her autistic condition. But the court said that Hannah had an underlying cell disorder, mitochondria, which had been aggravated by the vaccinations and manifested itself as autism. In Ryan’s case, Chief Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith decided his family was eligible for damages under the US government’s Vaccine Programme.",

        "document": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's been a year since the parents of a severely disabled child made public their decision to submit their daughter to a hysterectomy, breast surgery and drugs to keep the girl forever small. Today, the couple tell CNN, they believe they made the right decision -- one that could have a profound impact on the care of disabled children worldwide. The profoundly disabled girl known as Ashley, now 10, has achieved her full height,  4 feet 5 inches. \"The 'Ashley treatment' has been successful in every expected way,\" Ashley's parents told CNN exclusively in a lengthy e-mail interview. \"It has potential to help many others like it helped our precious daughter.\" While unwavering in their belief in the treatment, Ashley's parents continue to insist on anonymity. In the year since Ashley's parents went public, not only did the hospital that sterilized Ashley admit it broke Washington state law, but also the doctor who treated Ashley committed suicide. As scrutiny of the case deepens, so too does the chasm in the medical community: Is it mutilation, with doctors \"playing God\" -- or, is stunting growth a liberating option for caregivers and the disabled children who will need constant care for the rest of their lives? Ashley is now 10 years old and, at 4 feet 5 inches tall, has achieved her full height and weight, 63 pounds. The treatment permanently closed her growth plates and took more than a foot off her anticipated height. \"Ashley did not grow in height or weight in the last year, she will always be flat-chested, and she will never suffer any menstrual pain, cramps or bleeding,\" say her parents, who felt it important to publicly address their decision after repeated interview requests, in the hopes of sharing their experience with other families. They responded by e-mail only, to protect the family's identity. (Read the complete interview) Ashley's current state -- to them -- is the definition of success. She was born brain-damaged, with a condition described as static encephalopathy, or cerebral palsy. One of her doctors described her mental capacity as that of a 6-month-old, dependent upon her parents to meet every need. She does not walk or talk; she's fed through a tube and wears diapers. When Ashley was 6, her parents approached Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, for the operations. They believed this would make it easier to cuddle and carry a child who can do little more than lie propped on a pillow. Weight and height are the \"worst enemy,\" they write, for children such as Ashley, for whom they've coined the term \"pillow angels.\" In 2004, Children's Hospital performed a hysterectomy, removed Ashley's breast buds and gave her high-dose estrogen to retard growth and sexual maturation -- a procedure that has risks, but to date has not harmed her, her parents say. While the \"Ashley treatment\" was first published in the October 2006 issue of the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, it wasn't until the family posted its blog last year that a firestorm erupted in the blogosphere, with responses from \"inhumane\" and \"perverse\" -- to \"walk in our shoes.\" \"If parents of children like Ashley believe this treatment will improve their children's quality of life, then they should be diligent and tenacious in providing it for them,\" her parents write. \"We have a sacred duty to do what we believe is right for our children.\" But in Ashley's case, what her parents thought was right wasn't legal. In May 2007, Children's Hospital admitted it broke state law by giving Ashley a hysterectomy without a proper court review. To perform any such treatment today would require a court order, as well as review by a panel of experts in medicine and ethics and people with disabilities, says Dr. Douglas Diekema of Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics, the consulting ethicist on Ashley's case. So, will doctors stop the growth of more children like Ashley? Right now, no growth-attenuation therapy is being administered by other doctors anywhere in the nation, according to pediatric experts. Supporters wonder whether another factor, the suicide in September of Ashley's endocrinologist, Dr. Daniel Gunther, may have slowed wider adoption of the treatment. \"We know from reliable sources his treatment of our daughter was a source of energy and motivation for him,\" Ashley's parents write. \"He was frustrated about being blocked from providing this treatment to other children in need. He strongly believed this treatment should be available to them.\" The family appears to be the lone voice with that opinion; CNN shared the family's comment with Children's Hospital, but did not get a response. In media reports, colleagues and family members were said to believe Gunther's suicide was not related to the treatment of the girl. Another complicating factor -- some doctors remain adamant the treatment shouldn't be available. \"Adults can consent. But for a child, we're making decisions for them and hoping in our heart of hearts we are making the right decisions,\" says Dr. Nancy Murphy, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Children with Disabilities. Murphy will push for consensus among doctors at a pediatrics conference later this year, but acknowledges strong discord as critics continue to insist that keeping children small reduces them to a permanent infant-like condition, denying the basic human right to experience an adult body, adult feelings and adult relationships. But for Ashley, that may be moot. \"[This disability] shatters the reason we become parents: to watch kids grow, to be part of their lives and to launch into their own lives,\" says Murphy. \"When you have a child with lifelong dependency, you don't get to launch your kid, and your caregiver options are limited.\" But like many other people with disabilities, 43-year-old Anne Rader, who also has cerebral palsy but in a much less severe form than Ashley's, sees the treatment as dehumanizing -- and perhaps most significantly -- irrevocable. \"The parents are not seeing the potential of the child; they are seeing a baby,\" says Rader. \"People with disabilities have to look at the potential of our lives: of available new technology, new equipment, medical advances. Things can change so quickly now.\" Some ethicists, too, remain staunch in their assessment that the \"Ashley treatment\" is a violation of not only human dignity, but also of a physician's oath to do no harm. \"I think mutilating surgery involving removal of breast buds is indefensible under any circumstances,\" says Arthur Caplan, the chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Growth retardation is not a substitute for adequate home aides and home assistance.\" Ashley's parents remain convinced what they did for Ashley is the most loving choice they could have made for their daughter and want that for other disabled children. \"We feel that if our time and effort ended up helping a single pillow angel... then it is worthwhile.\" E-mail to a friend .",

The schoolgirl suffered from a rare form of autism and Sotos Syndrome and died in hospital on January 27 - the day after the incident - leaving her parents, Anthony and Jane Pearce, devastated. Mr Pearce, 56, from Ide Hill, in Sevenoaks, Kent, said her death was incomprehensible. 'It is unbelievable that it could happen. You send your child off to school - to somewhere you imagine is safe,' he said. 'She was in a good place. She was not at all compromised in any way - to any degree - that could have caused this to happen. 'Her condition did not affect how she was able to swallow. It could not have been further from the truth.' Mrs Pearce, 56, added: 'I still expect to her to come in - I suppose it is something in my brain. 'On the day it happened she was not ill, she just went to school and never came home. I hugged her. I don't normally do that. I put her in the taxi that morning. 'Her hair had been washed and she did look really beautiful.' Kent Police confirmed it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the teenagers sudden death. A spokesman from the force said: 'Kent Police is currently reviewing the death of a 13-year-old girl and is liaising with the coroner's officer as part of the coronial process.' Isabel Pearce died after choking on a meatball at lunchtime at Ridge View School in Tonbridge, Kent, above . Head teacher, Jacqui Tovey, head teacher, said: 'Isabel's death has been a tremendous shock to us all and our thoughts are with Isabel's family. 'The whole school community has been devastated by her death and she will be greatly missed. 'We understand it is normal procedure for the police to be involved in a review of an unexpected death and the school is co-operating fully with the police over this.'",

        "document": "By . Lizzie Parry . and Emma Innes . She has survived three brain haemorrhages, each of which could have killed her. Despite stunning doctors by cheating death, Ellie Calder continues to live with a ticking timebomb in her head, which threatens to claim her life at any moment. The 20-year-old suffers from an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a rare mass of abnormal blood vessels, that can haemorrhage at random. Ellie Calder, 20, has already had three brain haemorrhages and could have another one at any moment . Miss Calder, from Nantwich in Cheshire, was seven years old when she suffered her first brain bleed. Four years later the second struck, followed by the third haemorrhage when she was 16. But despite living at risk of suffering a fatal brain bleed at any moment, Miss Calder refuses to let her condition affect her life. She said: 'Sometimes I can’t quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable. 'A lot of people would have a permanent disability, but I’m fortunate to have no lasting damage. 'The hope is that through the treatment I’m receiving from the incredible people at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, the AVM will shrink and disappear completely. Miss Calder (pictured with her boyfriend in hospital) has an abnormal mass of blood vessels in her brain which can haemorrhage dangerously without warning . Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, William) had her first haemorrhage when she was seven. She had her second one four years later and her third one when she was 16 . 'It’s amazing to think that one day I might not have to live with this. 'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I’m living with as I’d just scare myself - there’s no point living in fear. 'Thanks to the Walton I live just like any other girl my age - I go to uni, I have friends and an amazing boyfriend - I owe everything to them really. 'I just try not to focus on my condition, and get on with my life.' An arteriovenous malformation in the brain is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels. Normally, arteries carry high pressure blood and veins carry lower pressure blood but in an AVM blood is diverted directly from the arteries to the veins. They can cause brain haemorrhages, seizures, headaches and difficulty with movement, speech and vision. Brain AVMs occur in less than one per cent of people - they are more common in men than women. It is not known why they occur but patients are usually born with them. Treatment options include surgery and radiosurgery. Source: American Stroke Association . Miss Calder was just seven years old when she collapsed on Boxing Day, having had her first subarachnoid haemorrhage. She said: 'I don’t remember much of it as I was so young, but all of a sudden I was totally unable to move my arms and legs. 'I was rushed to hospital, but after a few tests and investigations I was discharged. 'My parents were really worried as they were sure that something more was wrong.' Four years later, while at school, Ms Calder was struck down with another bleed. She said: 'I wasn’t really able to comprehend what had happened or the seriousness of the situation. 'But again I remember waking up and not being able to use my legs. 'I was at the Walton Centre for two weeks - at first I was treated with suspected meningitis but then a consultant sent me for a CT scan. 'It was that that they discovered I had an AVM about 5cm by 5cm just millimetres away from my brain stem. It was a shock to everyone - we just had no idea.' Miss Calder was told that she would be monitored twice a year, and would undergo gamma knife radiosurgery to reduce the size of the AVM. But the condition struck again the day before Miss Calder's high school prom. She said: 'I’d had my nails and tan done and was in the shower when I experienced a sudden sharp pain. Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, Karl) has, amazingly, not suffered any long term brain damage following the brain haemorrhages that she had suffered so far . Miss Calder (pictured with her stepmother and baby sister) is now hoping doctors will be able to shrink the growth to prevent her having another bleed . 'It felt as though someone had hit me on the back of the head with a shovel. 'The next thing I can remember is looking down at my hands and seeing my nails had grown out and my tan was patchy where the tubes and drips were. 'I cried and cried when I realised I’d missed my prom. 'This time I underwent a surgery called endovascular surgery, but I lost the ability to walk or see properly - I couldn’t even do basic things. 'It was like my brain just didn’t want to work properly anymore, and I was warned that in 50 per cent of cases it could be permanent. 'It was pretty terrifying but the Walton Centre staff helped me to walk and see again. Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, William, and sister, Florence) says the abnormal blood vessels are too close to her brain stem to enable surgeons to operate . Miss Calder said: 'Sometimes I can't quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable' 'Thanks to them I was out of hospital within a few months and starting college - I really owe my life to them.' Ms Calder's AVM is still present, but so close to her brain stem that it makes open brain surgery impossible. She continues to be monitored at the Walton Centre, and hopes the radiosurgery will continue to shrink the AVM until it disappears altogether. She said: 'I try not to let my AVM and what it could do affect me - I’ve known about it from such a young age so I’m used to the idea now and I feel normal. 'The only symptom I get is migraines but it could be a lot worse. 'I can’t go too crazy on the rides at Alton Towers, and I have to be a bit careful if I go on nights out - but apart from that I’m a normal university student. Miss Calder (pictured with her grandfather) said: 'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I'm living with as I'd just scare myself - there's no point living in fear' 'I just have to stay positive, and one day hope that I can put all this behind. 'I’m fortunate to have an incredible family, boyfriend, and group of friends that keep me positive.' Consultant neuroradiologist Dr Hans Nahser of The Walton Centre said: 'A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of abnormal connections between arteries and veins. 'They appear in the brain as tangles of blood vessels and are usually diagnosed following a scan after someone feels ill with symptoms such as headaches or a seizure. 'In serious cases the blood vessels can rupture and be the cause of a disastrous bleed in the brain, known as a brain haemorrhage. Miss Calder is pictured with her family. L to R: brother Karl, stepmother Christine, brother Charlie, sister Florence, brother Matthew, brother William and father, Arthur . 'Brain AVMs are still considered to be maldevelopments of cerebral arteries you are born with. 'At The Walton Centre brain AVMs are treated in a range of ways including open neurosurgical operations, endovascular embolisation, stereotactic radiosurgery or a combination of these treatments. 'Endovascular embolisation is a minimally invasive treatment using microcatheters through the arterial system to block of the arteriovenous shunts with special glue.'

        "document": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Isaac Lidsky arrives in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, stops suddenly and, upon hearing a voice, extends his hand in greeting almost instinctively. Isaac Lidsky graduated from Harvard University at 19. Retinitis pigmentosa has seriously impaired his vision. Seemingly simple gestures such as a hello don't always come easily for a man who is legally blind. But this hasn't deterred the ex-Justice Department prosecutor from pursuing a promising legal career, one that will take him inside the nation's highest court in a few weeks. The Florida native will join 36 of the nation's top young attorneys as law clerks to Supreme Court justices for the 2008-'09 term. He will be the first legally blind law clerk in the court's history. Lidsky, 28, will work with the retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and will be assured of long days writing and researching cases. \"I certainly am nervous to the extent I am eager to be helpful to the justice and productive,\" he said. \"I just want to do good work.\"  Watch as the lawyer will break new ground at the court » . Lidsky, a one-time actor, may be vaguely familiar to adults of a certain age. He played the lovable geek Barton \"Weasel\" Wyzell on the NBC series \"Saved by the Bell: The New Class\" in the 1990s. \"There's a little bit of a cringe factor because my character was not necessarily the coolest kid in school, but certainly, [there's] fond memories,\" he recalled. \"It was an incredible experience for a kid to have.\" Around that time, the 13-year-old was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease that already had struck two of his older sisters. The symptoms were slow to develop, so Lidsky came to terms early with the idea of losing his vision. Now his sight is seriously impaired. Lidsky said his parents, Betti and Carlos Lidsky, did not allow self-pity and encouraged him to help others like himself. \"Right away my parents really led the charge on saying, 'How can we take this challenge and turn it into something positive?' \" he said. \"So for 15 years we have been doing just that.\" Acting was never going to be a career for Lidsky. It was the law that always attracted him. As a child he went to court with his father, a prominent Miami lawyer. Becoming a Supreme Court law clerk, he said, was a lifelong dream. After graduating at 19 from Harvard University, he earned a degree from its law school, with a brief stop in between as an Internet business entrepreneur. In 2004, he began a clerkship with Judge Thomas Ambro of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ambro became a mentor to the bright young lawyer and witnessed a sudden decline in his vision. \"You could tell things were getting worse,\" Ambro said. By the end of the one-year assignment, \"he now needed a cane and was using a guide dog. Once he had no idea I was in the same room with him until I spoke.\" But that did not dull Lidsky's drive to succeed. \"He had a real good sense of what he was facing,\" Ambro said. \"He's determined to make it in the same way as other people who succeed. For him it was simply a matter of getting the tools to do it.\" Those tools include optical character recognition software, which scans printed words electronically and reads them back to him, and a Blackberry-type communication device that sends and receives e-mail audibly. Friends said he was a little reluctant over the years to embrace much of the technology, as he sought to preserve his independence as long as possible. After his clerkship came a stint in the Justice Department's Civil Division, where he argued about a dozen cases in federal courts. He said his acting skills came in handy when pleading before often skeptical judges. With the recommendations of Ambro and others, Lidsky applied four times to be a Supreme Court law clerk but was rejected. A meeting with longtime federal Judge David Tatel, who also is blind, convinced Lidsky he should not give up his dream. Then came the call from O'Connor. \"Sitting in her chambers, here I was worrying about having to recall the minutiae of legal doctrine\" for the personal interview, he recalled. \"But we fell into talking about our families and philosophies, and she made me feel very warm and welcome.\" O'Connor was not available for an interview, but former clerks said they remember her as a nurturing type who nevertheless demands much from them. \"I have no doubt Justice O'Connor will keep me very busy,\" Lidsky said. In addition, Lidsky likely will be assigned to an active justice to sort through the 9,000-some appeals that reach the high court every year. In that capacity, he would recommend which cases should be accepted for review and help write early drafts of opinions. O'Connor also will continue her practice of sitting in on several appeals court cases a year, so Lidsky will assist her on those, along with the 78-year-old's busy schedule of teaching, speeches and public advocacy. Lidsky will have to scale back involvement in his foundation, Hope for Vision, which he created with his wife, Dorothy, and some friends to raise awareness of blinding diseases. His group is launching a campaign this week to find a cure for blindness by 2020. \"We have communities of Hope across the country that do events to raise awareness and funding for research,\" he said. \"It's purely volunteer-driven, very grass-roots. Over 98 percent of the money we raise goes directly to scientific grants.\" As for the future, Lidsky plans to go to London, England, after his clerkship ends, so his wife can finish her master's degree. He would be set to rejoin his law firm, where he has taken a leave of absence, but has no specific career goals. \"In 10 or 15 years, I would bet he will be a man still on your radar screen,\" Ambro predicts. Lidsky appears more modest. \"I'm not out there to set any kinds of records or prove anything to anybody,\" he said. \"As odd as it may sound, losing my vision has in a lot of ways been a very rewarding experience for me.\" CNN's Kelli Arena contributed to this report.",

        "document": "By . Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 14:00 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:49 EST, 16 January 2014 . Prince Edward’s daughter has had an operation to correct a severe squint. Since she was born, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor has suffered from esotropia - a condition which means both eyes do not look in the same direction. If left untreated it can cause serious vision problems. Successful: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor's transformation was first evident when the Earl and Countess of Wessex, attended a racing event at Royal Ascot in December . But the Queen’s ten-year-old . grand-daughter is understood to have had corrective surgery on the . advice of doctors – and her transformation during a recent visit to . Ascot suggested it had been a success. It could also be seen as she accompanied her parents, Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie, to church at Sandringham on Christmas Day. Although Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on her health, it is understood Louise, who in 2011 was a bridesmaid for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was first operated on when she was just a toddler. Condition: Lady Louise has suffered from esotropia since birth - a condition which turns one eye outwards . As is often the case, however, it soon became clear that she would require further treatment when older. Details of the surgery or whether it was carried out on the NHS or privately, have not been released. But in most cases a paediatric ophthalmologist would carefully move the position of the muscles on the eye in order to make it easier to control. Louise, who is tenth in line to the throne, was a much longed-for child for Edward and Sophie, who suffered the heartbreak of an ectopic pregnancy two years before she was conceived. She was born four weeks prematurely in an emergency caesarean operation during which Sophie's life was in peril. She lost nine pints of blood through internal bleeding and was said to be just minutes from death. Condition: The Queen's youngest granddaughter, pictured at the the Royal Wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is believed to have been first operated on when she was just a toddler . To Sophie's distress her daughter who weighed just 4lb 9oz, had to be transferred almost immediately for specialist care at St George's Hospital, in Tooting, South London, while she had to remain 35 miles away in Frimley Hospital, Surrey, for another 16 days. However she has since grown up to be a happy, healthy child who attends a local day school and bears an uncanny resemblance to her grandmother, the Queen, at the same age. The two enjoy a particularly close relationship and often go riding together along the with Wessex’s son, James, Viscount Severn, who is six. Royal family: Louise, who is tenth in line to the throne, was a much longed-for child for Edward and Sophie . The monarch is also frequent visitor to the family home, Bagshot Park, which is a short drive from Windsor Castle. Although she has pointedly refused to talk about her daughter’s vision problems in public, it is believed that they inspired the Countess to become patron of the charity Vision 2020 and Global Ambassador of The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). Last year the Countess undertook a visit to India to publicise their work, visiting the ORBIS Flying Eye Hospital, where she witnessed patients undergoing sight-saving surgery. Lady Louise Windsor attending a Sunday Church Service at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham . There are six muscles that control eye movement, four that move the eye up and down and two that move it from side to side. All these muscles must be working in coordination in order for the brain to see a single image. When one or more of these muscles do not operate properly, the eyes may not be aligned, causing the condition. Esotropia is mostly seen in children, who develop the condition from a young age, but can also be affect adults. Squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is a common side-effect. As the disorder progresses, the eyes will start to turn out when looking . at close objects as well as those in the distance. If left untreated, . the eye may turn out continually, having a significant impact on vision. Around 35% of sufferers require at least one surgery to have the condition sucessfully treated, so many people try vision therapy first. The surgical procedure to correction extropia is usually performed under general anesthesia and involves making a . small incision in the tissue covering the eye in order to reach the muscles. The muscles are then repositioned in order to . allow the eye to move properly. Following surgery, glasses may be needed and, in many cases, further surgery . is required later to keep the eyes straight.",

        "document": "An inspirational Chinese woman who refused prosthetic limbs after losing her feet in a childhood accident now walks miles to work everyday- on her knees. Every morning, Hu Fenglian, wraps her stumps with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires. She then shuffles for miles on her knees to get from her home deep in the mountains of southern China's Guangxi Province, to her job in the local village's lumberyard- earning her the local nickname of 'Sister Strong-Will'. Hu Fenglian, pictured walking along the street in Guangxi Province, China, has learnt to walk on her knees after a childhood accident left her with no feet and shortened legs . Hu was just six months old when she was severely injured after falling into a home heating stove leaving her with no feet and only partial lower legs. She was offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but said she found them too uncomfortable. 'After wearing them, my legs would swell, painful and inflammable. I had to quit them,' she explained. Then tragedy struck again in 1982, when her husband abandoned her and the family, leaving her to support their four-month-old baby. When Hu was only 6 months old, she had accidentally fallen into a home heating stove and severely injured her lower legs . But the 50-year-old refuses to let her disability stop her and is even able to work in a lumber factory (pictured) Hu Fenglian's home is deep in the hills and the bus can only deliver her to the entrance of the mountain so she had to walk on her knees the rest of the way (pictured) Despite losing so much, Hu said she wasn't angry or bitter, only grateful she survived the accident. 'I never feel the life is unfair to me,' she said. Refusing to let it hold her back, she added she had never dreamed of begging. Instead the incredible mother took every job she could- from plowing the fields to even working down a mine between 2006 and 2010- all while walking on her knees. 'I have no feet, but I have hands and I have strength. I can support myself,' said the 50-year-old. Her incredible spirit and determination has seen her nicknamed 'Sister Strong-Will' in her hometown of Jiangdi, in southern China's Guangxi Province . She said she would never dream of begging but was proud to be able to support herself and buy her own food (pictured) Incredibly, for around four years, between 2006-2010, Hu had even worked in a mine before her current job in a lumber yard (pictured) 'I did every job to support the family and my little daughter. I crawled in the field in plowing it. 'I worked in the quarry, and I learnt to make embroideries. I felt guilty as I can't give her a better life. 'My principles are simple, sharing, friendly, and working hard. I don't care much about the amount of salaries, as long as I work with a happy team and company.' From last October, with the help of local disabled people association, she has now found a job in a local lumber factory. A local disabled people association had got involved and found her the position in the lumber factory (pictured) last October . Working in the lumber yard: Hu has done a wide variety of jobs to support the family and her little daughter . She says she has also crawled in the field to plow it, worked in a quarry and learnt to make embroideries . Before going out, Hu wraps her knees with cloth before adding a pair of rubber 'shoes' made out of old bus tires . She married in 1980, and two years later her daughter was born but when her baby was only four months old, her husband abandoned them . Hu was left to support the whole family on her own despite her disability- her daughter has since married and moved away . The inspiring figure was once offered the chance of a pair of prosthetic legs but found them too uncomfortable . She said that after wearing prosthetics, her legs would swell and become very painful to walk on . Out shopping: Hu refuses to let her disability hold her back and will walk on her knees down to the shops or to work . 'Sister Strong-Will' says she doesn't feel angry about the accident that robbed her of her feet, but she said she was simply grateful that she survived .",

        "document": "By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 14:33 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:39 EST, 11 January 2013 . Dressed in their best and posing for the camera they look for all the world like any other wealthy Edwardian family enjoying an English seaside holiday. These smiling pictures - forgotten for more than a century - offer an unusually relaxed insight into how a wealthy family once holidayed. Doing away with the somewhat stilted, awkward pose usually adopted in family pictures at the time, George . and Theodora Hewitt and their three children, Doris, Cecil and Graily, . are shown enjoying a family holiday like a great deal many others . would have done, in the town of Sheringham, Norfolk. Yet these images are particularly poignant, because they were taken by the sports-loving family's disabled son Cecil. A set of touching family photographs taken in the early 1900s and showcasing the talent of a disabled photographer have been unearthed in a small museum . Cecil Hewitt took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57 . They catalogue the holidays of the wealthy Hewitt family from London. It is believed many were taken by Cecil Hewitt, one of the family's sons . While his family enjoyed the fashionable leisure pursuits of the era, Cecil, who suffered with an unrecorded condition, documented their life with his camera capturing the Hewitts . relaxing on the beach, posing in front of a First World War pillbox and . taking part in fashionable leisure pursuits and games. Amateur photographer Ron Wiebe found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at The Mo museum in Sheringham. Mr Wiebe said he believed the family . gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking . part in so many other things. He said: 'It was one of his few outlets. 'There . are a lot of photos of family parties and people standing on the . croquet lawn and in front of the grass steps, which they seemed very . proud of,' he said. 'They always seemed to have a sporting implement in their hands and there are lots of photos of them having afternoon tea.' Cecil Hewitt suffered from an unrecorded condition which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair. It is believed the sports mad family gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things . Cecil Hewitt with his mother by a World War One pillbox, an armoured trench used to defend the country from attack in the Great War . A car belonging to the family. Amateur photographer Ron Wiebe found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at The Mo museum in Sheringham . Smart: The family and their friends are all impeccably dressed even as they relax on holiday . Fascinated by the images he discovered, Mr Wiebe has been scanning and cataloguing the collection and researching the Hewitt family pictured in the photographs. Mr Wiebe said: 'There were nearly 1,200 images in the collection sitting in old shoe boxes.'Nothing had been done with them. 'I looked at them and saw it was quite a treasure of photographs. 'As I started to photograph these things, I started to become interested in the people in them and started to do a bit of family history research.' The family, lived a comfortable life in London. Wealthy George Hewitt made his money selling horse medicine as a partner in a company which still exists today under the name Day, Son & Hewitt. Close: Mr Wiebe said he believed the family gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things . Relaxed: Cecil looks happy as he stands in this picture with a family member . The pictures, taken between 1906 and 1926, show the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham where they had a holiday home . The seaside resort was an eighteenth-century invention. Many doctors at the time prescribed 'sea air' for the sickly and disabled as an alternative to 'taking the cure' at a spa. As a result, generations of holidaymakers, from the early Victorian age until the Thirties, saw England's seaside resorts flourish. Here was a place where holidaymakers and visitors could enjoy the beauty, the power and the much-touted healing properties of the sea, all from the safety of the sturdy pier. During the great Victorian building boom, all seaside towns wanted a pier, and soon they had sprung up around the coastline. Such was their popularity that by the turn of the century there were 90 piers around the country. The family built a holiday home they named East Court on the corner of Holt Road and Abbey Road in Sheringham in 1903, which has now been converted in to flats. Cecil, who was born in 1890, suffered from an unknown disability which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair. He took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57. The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham. Through his research, Mr Wiebe has discovered Graily survived his time as a soldier in the Great War, only to die in mysterious circumstances in a hotel room in France several years later aged only 30. He has also learned that although Graily and Doris both married neither of them had children. Mr Wiebe, who has now become one of The Mo's trustees, now plans to continue his research in to the Hewitt family. Sheringham's Mo museum, which is run mainly by volunteers, lacked the manpower and resources to formally catalogue the negatives and slides when they were donated in 1991. They were left in a cupboard for more than two decades as a result. A £6,000 Big Society Fund grant has enabled the museum to begin tackling the backlog, properly preserve the Hewitt collection and buy touch screen computers to enable visitors to view all of its photographs easily. Looking back: Members of the Hewitt family are captured enjoying their seaside break by Cecil . High life: The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham . Having fun: The pictures show the Hewitts and their friends looking content and happy while they enjoy their holiday . Museum manager Philip Miles said the collection was one of the most exciting things the museum had ever found. Mr Miles said: 'The work Ron has done for us would have cost thousands of pounds.'The museum couldn't exist without the volunteers. 'We . are very appreciative of his work and pleased that we have been able to . preserve the collection for future generations to enjoy. The Mo will reopen on March 1. Amateur photographer Ron Wiebe - who found the slides stashed in shoeboxes - immediately set about researching the family . Mr Wiebe, who has now become one of The Mo's trustees, now plans to continue his research in to the Hewitt family .",

        "document": "By . William Turvill . PUBLISHED: . 14:19 EST, 23 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:23 EST, 23 December 2013 . Police investigating a crash in which a disabled pensioner was run over and left to die have released details of a car at the scene. Christopher Colegate, 69, who walked with the aid of two sticks, died after being knocked down on the way to his local Conservative club in Poole, Dorset. Officers have said the driver of a silver BMW 3 series at the scene is believed to be a ‘witness, not a suspect’ and may have seen part of the incident. Knocked down: Christopher Colegate, 69, pictured holding his granddaughter in 2007 was killed in a hit and run collision as he walked to his local Conservative club . After suffering significant injuries from the incident, which took place at 7.25pm on Friday December 13, . the frail pensioner was taken to Poole Hospital but later died. Police Sergeant Stuart Pitman, of Dorset Police’s Traffic Unit appealed for the driver of the BMW to come forward. ‘I . believe this vehicle is a silver BMW 3 Series manufactured between . March 1998 and February 2006,’ Police Sergeant Pitman said. ‘This BMW . was in the immediate area of the collision scene at the time and I am . convinced the driver would have witnessed some of the incident. ‘I wish to make it clear that I believe this to be a witness not a suspect. ‘The . BMW drove along Wimborne Road away from the town centre, turning right . into Dorchester Road in Oakdale then left into Darby’s Lane.’ The popular Poole pensioner walked with the aid of two sticks . After the incident, Mr Colegate’s daughter, Tash Motton, told a press conference: 'We were really looking forward to Christmas. It should have been a happy end to what has already been a difficult year for the family. 'Now without dad, there will be an empty chair around the table on Christmas day and unopened presents under the tree. 'We now live with the knowledge that . every Christmas is going to be a reminder of this tragic incident. The . ache in our heart will never go away.' The . popular Poole pensioner’s two daughters made the impassioned plea as . they sat with their mother, Freda, at Oakdale Conservative Club in . Darby’s Lane, Poole, Dorset. Despite suffering from a chronic disability which caused him to stoop, Mr Colegate played an active role in his community. Rachel Hayward, Mr Colegate’s other daughter, said: 'An innocent husband, dad and grandad - Chris Colegate - was taken from us in such a horrific way. 'The collision itself may well have been a genuine accident but we are all struggling to come to terms with the fact that the driver of that car did not stop following the collision. 'The driver could have come to his aid; could have called for help but instead, thought only of themselves and selfishly fled the scene.' Police . Sergeant Pitman added: ‘I am still keen to speak to the drivers of two . other vehicles that were in the area at the time of the collision. ‘A . Honda Civic-type vehicle travelling from Darby’s Lane into Popes Road . and a medium sized light-coloured family car which travelled along Heath . Avenue toward Wimborne Road at speed. ‘I urge these drivers to come forward so we can eliminate you from the investigation. ‘I . would also like to trace a male pedestrian walking along Darby’s Lane . toward Johnston Road who passed Mr Colegate shortly before the . collision. This pedestrian was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood . up.’ Grief: Mr Colegate's family (L-R) wife Freda Colegate , daughter Tash Motton and daughter Rachel Hayward, appealed for the killer to give themselves up to the police . Mr Colegate’s family paid tribute to the ‘popular husband, dad and grandpa’ following the witness appeal. In . a statement, Mr Colegate’s wife Freda and daughters Tash Motton and . Rachel Hayward said: ‘Our Dad was a popular character and the nature of . his illness meant he was distinctive when out and about and his frailty . obvious. ‘Despite his chronic disabilities he remained independent . and as active as possible. He was well-known in the community for his . generous nature and happy disposition. He would do anything for his . family and friends. ‘He loved his grandchildren to bits and would do . anything for them. Every year on her birthday, he made his granddaughter . a number for her playhouse to reflect her age. It is her birthday on . Christmas Day. She knows there will be no number eight this year. ‘So . many lovely things have been said about Dad since the collision and the . family would like to thank those people for all their kind words. We . would now ask that we are left alone for a period and given some time to . deal with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.’ The charity Crimestoppers has offered has offered a reward of up . to £1,000 for information that leads to the arrest and charge of an . offender. Anyone with information is asked to contact Dorset Police or Crimestoppers.",

        "document": "By . Emma Lowe . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 8 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 9 December 2013 . As Susan Boyle was catapulted into the public eye on Britain’s Got Talent, fans watched as she struggled to cope with the rigours of a rapid rise to fame. Yesterday the multi-millionaire singer opened up for the first time about her difficulties – revealing she has been diagnosed with Asperger’s. The talent show runner-up said that  she feels ‘relieved’ to finally understand her condition, which until now has gone undetected. Asperger's: Singing star Susan Boyle opened up about her difficulties in an interview with Hello! magazine . Susan Boyle was blackmailed by her older brother Gerry, who threatened to kill himself if she did not part with £50,000, it has been reported . The 52-year-old had always thought the ‘learning difficulties’ and ‘slowness’ she experienced had been caused by complications at birth. But a year ago Miss Boyle visited a Scottish specialist who later diagnosed her with Asperger’s – a form of autism that mainly affects social interaction and communication skills. After claiming she was misdiagnosed with brain damage as a child – and cruelly dubbed ‘Susan Simple’ at school – Miss Boyle said she now feels more relaxed in her own skin. She told Observer Magazine: ‘I always knew it was an unfair label. Now I have a clearer understanding of what’s wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself.’ 'Relief': Susan, who has previously admitted she struggled with 'learning difficulties' and 'slowness', said it was good to finally be diagnosed . For Miss Boyle the symptoms have been subtle but she admitted the diagnosis finally explained why she has suffered from anxiety around strangers and delayed eye contact . Miss Boyle has always struggled with her health. Suffering from depression as a young . woman in Blackburn, Glasgow, the isolation it caused made her more . determined ‘to be where I want to be’. But knowing she has Asperger’s has now helped explain why she also suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact – making her feel ‘different’ and ‘an outsider’ throughout her childhood. She added: ‘It’s a condition that I have to live with and work through, but I feel more relaxed about myself. People will have a greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do. Interview: Susan Boyle spoke about the condition in the latest issue of Hello! magazine . ‘I have communicative difficulties, which leads to a lot of frustration. If people were a bit more patient it would help.’ Miss Boyle shot to fame in 2009 when her audition on the ITV1 talent show became a global sensation on YouTube. But the sudden fame made the singer’s Asperger’s more difficult to manage and she went into rehab after coming second in the final. The I Dreamed A Dream singer, who has previously spoken about her struggles with depression, says she is now in a healthy and positive place. She said: ‘Mental illness carries less stigma now. It’s not indulgence, it’s a negative process, but if you can turn it into a positive it makes you stronger. Believe me.’ Miss Boyle employs a team of people to help her combat her anxiety difficulties, adding: ‘I’m not strong on my own.’ People with Asperger’s often struggle to understand conversation and have difficulty comprehending gestures, facial expressions or tone of voice. Initiating and sustaining social relationships can be tricky, and it can sometimes lead to an intense, sometimes obsessive, interest in a hobby or collecting. Mark Lever, of The National Autistic Society, said public understanding of Asperger’s can make a ‘huge difference’. He added: ‘By revealing her diagnosis, Susan has played an important role in bringing the issue of autism to the nation’s attention.’ Miss Boyle is this month releasing a duet with Elvis Presley – with technology used to combine her vocals with those of the American icon, who died in 1977. The single, O Come All Ye Faithful, is raising money for Save The Children. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, which is a lifelong disability that affects how a person makes sense of the world, processes information and relates to other people. It is often described as a 'spectrum disorder' because the condition affects people in many different ways and to varying degrees. The main problematic triggers are social communication, social interaction and social imagination. Asperger’s sufferers struggle with understanding conversation, with extreme cases finding  every day conversation as difficult as a foreign language. Sufferers can often find it difficult to pick up social cues and find it hard to know what to do when they get things wrong. The characteristics of Asperger syndrome vary from one person to another but as well as the three main areas of difficulty, people with the condition may have a love of routinesspecial interests and sensory difficulties. People with Asperger syndrome may develop an intense, sometimes obsessive, interest in a hobby or collecting. It is not caused by a person's upbringing, their social circumstances and is not the fault of the individual with the condition. Star: Susan Boyle finished as runner up on Britain's Got Talent in 2009 and has launched a successful career on the back of it .",

A British teenager who lost his leg after contracting meningitis as a boy became a Paralympic hero tonight as he won gold at London 2012. Jonnie Peacock, 19, won his eagerly-awaited sprint final against fellow blade runner Oscar Pistorius to become the 100m champion in a Paralympic record time of 10.90secs. The success for Peacock, from Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, which was eagerly watched by a record 6.3 million viewers, was all the sweeter given his remarkable recovery from a condition which almost killed him 14 years ago. Scroll down for video . He's got it! Jonnie Peacock celebrates with his well-deserved gold medal after winning the Men's 100m - T44 Final . Winner: Jonnie Peacock poses with the Union flag after defeating South African athlete Oscar Pistorius to claim the title of the world's 'fastest amputee' First to the finish line: Johnnie Peacock smashed the competition as he raced over the finishing line . On fire! The Briton raced to glory last night in the men's final - a huge achievement for the athlete who almost died of meningitis when he was a youngster . Peacock was only five when he contracted meningitis in October 1998. He was taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, where he lay in a coma for four days with doctors warning his parents that he may not survive. Blood poisoning meant that surgeons had to amputate his right leg just below the knee to rid his body of the deadly infection. But he was determined not to be beaten by his disability and fought to enjoy his childhood as much as possible, even cycling with his sisters. Out in front: Britain's Jonnie Peacock (L) crosses the line first to win ahead of South Africa's Arnu Fourie (green and gold vest) and US athlete Richard Brown (right) Here's Johnnie! The determination is plain to see as realises he has just won gold . Record-breaker: Jonnie Peacock celebrates winning the 100m sprint final for Britain in a Paralympic best time of 10.90secs . Respect: Peacock is embraced by South Africa's Oscar Pistorius after winning gold . His improvement was so dramatic that his family had their benefits cut only 18 months after he was taken ill. When . medics assessed Peacock in 2000, they were so impressed by his . athleticism that they decided he could move like any other . seven-year-old. It meant the weekly payment to his mother of £92.25 in disability benefit was halted for six months from February 2000. The family appealed against the decision and the Benefits Agency agreed to make payments of £51.30 a week in mobility allowance. The agency also agreed to backdate . the missed payments and guaranteed that the family would receive . financial support until Peacock was 16. They all want a piece of him! Draped in the Union Jack, the super athlete rushes to embrace his family and supporters who are overjoyed at his achievement . Emotional: The atmosphere in the Olympic Stadium reached fever pitch as Peacock took gold . All of them were going for gold! How the super athletes matched up . Peacock was inspired to remain . athletic after he met England football stars Michael Owen and David . Beckham on a visit to watch the national team in 2000. That . year he was also able to take up ballet and, fitted with an artificial . limb, he attended weekly dance classes at his local village hall from . the age of eight. His proud mother Linda Roberts, now 46, said Peacock had been a fighter ever since he lost his leg. Ms . Roberts, of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, added: 'A doctor told me my . little boy had 48 hours to live and that now was the time to say . goodbyes. But I couldn’t. 'People . say he’s wonderful because he’s achieving all these great things but . for me he doesn’t have to win a race for me to be proud of him. Terrific trio: Jonnie Peacock (centre) of Great Britain, Richard Browne (left) of USA and Arnu Fourie (right) of South Africa celebrate their wins with their medals after trouncing the other competitors . Soaking up the attention: Fans flock to get the Paralympian's autograph - and he looks happy to sign for adoring well-wishers . Golden child: 19-year-old Peacock celebrates with his gold - which he hopes will be the first of many . 'When . you remember the little boy who stared down at his leg and wondered . what had happened to his world, you remember how far he’s come. 'He’s beaten greater battles than Oscar Pistorius. 'Just competing is such a fantastic achievement for him.' The 19-year-old poster boy, who had . promised to ‘shock the world’ at London 2012, lived up to his boast by . claiming the title of the world’s ‘fastest amputee’. Roared . on by 80,000 packed inside the Olympic Stadium, Peacock blazed up the . track to win the most eagerly anticipated clash of the Paralympics. Pistorius finished fourth. It . came on a magnificent night for Paralympic GB that saw wheelchair . racers David Weir and Hannah Cockcroft power to victories as Britain . smashed its medal target in London 2012 with three days of competition . still to go. For Weir, 33, his win in the T54 800m completed a brilliant hat-trick of golds before his home crowd, while 20-year-old Cockcroft’s win in the T34 women’s 200m was her second gold of the Paralympic Games in the stadium. Their successes helped to propel Team GB past their Beijing medal haul of 102 and London 2012 target total of 103 with realistic prospects of at least another 20 medals. The distinction of winning GB’s 103rd medal fell to swimmer Heather Frederiksen, claiming silver in the S8 100m freestyle. More . than one million people have paid so far to watch Paralympic athletes . give their inspirational performances in London’s Olympic Stadium – . meaning it has been the most commercially successful of any Paralympics . so far. The clash between . Peacock and Pistorius was considered the Blue Riband event and had been . among the most talked about of London 2012. The win could now be worth a fortune to Peacock, with companies and backers lining up for him to endorse their products. The . defeat means that Pistorius, the world’s most famous Paralympian, has . now been beaten in his first two individual events at London 2012 . although he did take South Africa to a relay gold medal on Wednesday. And breathe: The athlete looks a little overwhelmed as he steps up to the podium to be presented with his medals and flowers . Star of the future: A photograph of Jonnie Peacock, taken before he lost a leg after contracting meningitis at the age of five . For . Britain, a new star emerged last night when 15-year-old swimmer Josef . Craig won his first Paralympic gold medal in spectacular style. The . teenager won the S7 400m freestyle in a world record time of four . minutes 42.81 seconds. It trumped the world record he had set hours . earlier in the heats by three seconds – to the amazement of his rivals. Craig, who has cerebral palsy, punched the air and blew kisses to the crowd after his win. The schoolboy, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, said: ‘It means more than anything in the world. It’s the happiest day of my life.’ National heroes: Peacock was seven years old when he met England footballer Michael Owen. The meeting inspired him to become a sporting hero himself . Incredible recovery: Jonnie Peacock's mother . Linda Roberts (left) has revealed how the teenager, pictured trying out a . prosthetic running leg at 16 (right), surprised medics with his . athleticism . A record audience of more than six million tuned in to watch Jonnie Peacock’s lightning 100m gold - the biggest of the Paralympics so far. The nation has continued to take the Games to its heart, as athletes perform in sell-out crowds and millions watch at home. 'Thriller Thursday' was capped in stunning fashion in the Olympic Stadium last night as David Weir, Hurricane Hannah Cockroft and Peacock all won gold. Ratings for the coverage show the 100m showdown - which also featured Oscar Pistorius - pulled in a huge 6.3 million viewers. Including the Paralympic Extra live streams, the peak was 6.7 million. The figure smashed the previous highest for a live event, which was 4.4million for Sunday’s 200m race in which Pistorius lost to Brazilian Alan Oliveira. David 'The Weirwolf' Weir drew 5.5 million for his stunning 800m victory and 4.1 million watched Halifax flier Cockroft storm to 200m gold last night. The combined audience made the broadcaster the most watched television channel in the UK. Viewing figures have been steadily growing for the Paralympics, which started with 11.4 million people watching the opening ceremony last Wednesday night. An audience of 2.9 million watched swimmer Ellie Simmonds take gold in Saturday’s S6 400m freestyle event. The channel later said the viewing figures were its highest for any show in the past 10 years, and the ceremony is one of its most watched broadcasts of all time. The popularity of the Paralympics led Channel 4 to alter its schedules early in the Games, with all non-related content being taken off the air. Previously, coverage had reverted to More4 in the late afternoon with a selection of shows including Deal Or No Deal and The Simpsons being screened - but these have now been dropped in favour of non-stop coverage of the Games, broken only by Channel 4 News at 7pm. Channel 4’s chief creative officer Jay Hunt said: 'The coverage of the Paralympics has completely captured the public’s imagination.'

        "document": "By . Sadie Whitelocks . A heartfelt open letter from a mother thanking a 'kind stranger' for entertaining her autistic daughter during a two-and-half-hour flight has been read more than 51,000 times with many deeming it a 'touching' and 'beautiful' story. Shanell Mouland, 36, from New Brunswick, Canada, uploaded a note to her blog Go Team Kate last Thursday detailing how the mystery passenger engaged her three-year-old Kate in conversation instead of ignoring her. 'Thank you for not making me repeat those awful apologetic sentences that I so often say in public,' she wrote. 'Thank you for entertaining Kate so much that she had her most successful plane ride, yet. And, thank you for putting your papers away and playing turtles with our girl.' Scroll down for video . Grateful: Shanell Mouland, 36, from New Brunswick, Canada, penned an open letter thanking a stranger for being kind to her autistic daughter Kate during a two-and-half-hour plane journey - she has since been reunited with the man . Not only did Mrs Mouland's letter attract thousands of hits but it also saw her reunited with the 'hero' in question. One of Eric Kunkel's relatives forwarded him the post and he was amazed when he realized he was the one being praised. 'I read it and then went to [the Mouland's] Facebook page and the rest is history,' the married businessman from New Jersey said. The Moulands and Kunkels have now become good friends. Mrs Mouland revealed in her letter how Mr Kunkel had allowed Kate to call him 'daddy' without issuing a correction. The mother-of-two continued: 'The moment you sat down, Kate started to rub your arm. Hero: Eric Kiunkel said he was shocked when he realized he was the 'stranger' being praised . 'Your jacket was soft and she liked the feel of it.  You smiled at her and she said:  \"Hi, Daddy, that's my mom.\"  Then she had you.' 'You could have shifted uncomfortably in your seat. You could have ignored her.  You could have given me that 'smile' that I despise because it means; 'manage your child please.' 'You did none of that. You engaged Kate in conversation and you asked her questions about her turtles.' Mrs Mouland detailed in her letter, titled 'Dear 'Daddy' in Seat 16C Flight 1850 From Philly', how traveling with her autistic toddler can often be difficult. She was especially nervous this time around because she had been split up from her husband, who was sitting in another area of the plane with their other daughter. But thanks to Mr Kunkel's kindness, Kate stayed well-behaved for the duration of the flight from Philadelphia to Maine and only started getting agitated towards touch down. At the end of her letter, Mrs Mouland reassured her unknown companion: ‘[Kate] was fine the moment we stepped off the plane. Thank you for letting us go ahead of you. She was feeling overwhelmed and escaping the plane and a big, long hug was all she needed. 'So, thank you. Thank you for not making me repeat those awful apologetic sentences that I so often say in public. 'Thank you for entertaining Kate so much that she had her most successful plane ride, yet.' After reading the message, one commentator wrote: 'This is such a great story, it brought tears to my eyes. I have a daughter and know exactly what it is like to have to do the apologizing.' And another added: 'This was a very touching story and I am so glad that things turned out well. Sometimes we forget that there are still good people out there and are understanding.' From the heart: Mrs Mouland's open letter has since attracted more than 51,000 hits since it was posted on January 9 . Mrs Mouland said the experience taught her to never judge someone based on their appearance - which she did do with Mr Kunkel when she saw him on the plane. 'I assumed that a man in a business suit wouldn't be patient with Kate,' she told Yahoo, 'and I'm so fortunate to have been proved wrong.' Mrs Mouland and her family were returning home from a vacation at Disney World in Orlando and taking a connecting flight. 'I assumed that a man in a business suit . wouldn't be patient with Kate and I'm so fortunate to . have been proved wrong.' She decided to write an open thank you letter to the man she has now identified as Mr Kunkel after getting home and realizing what a gift she had received. Her daughter Kate was born eleven days late in May of 2010 and was a few weeks old when doctors diagnosed her with hypothyroidism - a condition affecting the thyroid gland. Mrs Mouland said she first started to realize something else was wrong with Kate when her speech and motor skills were slow to develop. In July 2012 she met with a pediatrician and speech pathologist who asked questions and made various observations. Recalling the meeting she writes on her blog: 'The assessment took about two hours. They asked if she pointed at things and looked for our reactions; she did not. Kate was diagnosed with autism in July 2012 after her mother noticed her speech and motor skills were not developing as they should have been . 'They asked if she had an interactive attention span and again she did not. They asked many more questions and I tried to craft my answers so that they could not nail down a diagnosis. '[My husband, Alex and I] still had hope, until the very last minute when the doctor walked into the room, sat down and said: \"Kate has autism spectrum disorder.\"   have no idea what she said after that. 'I held it together a little bit until I walked in and saw my mom and my brother. Then I cried for a little while.' She says that she finds comfort in  blogging about her experience of bringing up an autistic child. 'The emails and comments we are receiving through this blog have been priceless to us. 'The sweet comments and the suggestions are helping us make connections that are going to change things for kids like Kate and their families.' However, she says her main aim with the blog is to encourage a better understanding of autism so there will be more Mr Kunkels in the world.",

        "document": "By . Australian Associated Press . A doctor has been ordered to apologise to the family of a New Zealand woman who died after he 'completely forgot' to tell her she had breast cancer. The woman died earlier this year after a five-year battle with breast cancer which her GP failed to diagnose quickly, despite being told by a specialist that she probably had the disease. In a scathing report released by New Zealand's Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill on Monday, the GP was told to review his practice and audit his clinical files to ensure he didn't miss more cancer cases involving other patients. A New Zealand woman died earlier this year after a five year battle with breast cancer after her doctor failed to diagnose it quickly enough, despite being warned by a specialist radiologist . The woman, who had breast cancer treatment in 2003, went to the unidentified medical centre in November 2009 complaining of pain in her left shoulder. The doctor, who was aware she was a cancer survivor, referred her for an x-ray which a specialist radiologist said revealed a tendon tear that appeared 'highly suggestive of metastasis', or the spread of cancerous lesions. New Zealand's Health and Disability Commissioner Anthony Hill told the GP to review his practice and audit his clinical files to ensure he didn't miss more cancer cases in a recent report of the incident . The GP saw the woman again several days later but failed to tell her about the cancer link, instead only informing her of the tendon tear and giving her a steroid injection which the woman said was 'excruciating'. She was told to return in a month if the pain persisted, which she did once in December and again in January before the doctor finally referred her to an orthopaedic surgeon. The woman was diagnosed in February 2010, after which she changed doctors. Despite several years of active treatment, the woman died. The doctor told the inquiry he 'either overlooked or completely forgot about the radiologist's comment in relation to a suspicious lesion', the report states. Mr Hill criticised the GP for failing to read his own notes, ask the right questions, or reflect on his patient's medical history when assessing her. 'Doctors owe patients a duty of care in handling patient test results, including advising patients of, and following up on, results,' he said. The GP has been referred to the Director of Proceedings for possible legal action.",

Rondell Reed, 52, escaped with his cellmate, Leviticus Taylor, Monday from the Indian County Jail, officials said. Taylor, 25, who was quickly captured, was convicted of murder last month, according to CNN West Palm Beach affiliate WPBF. According to Indian County Sheriff Deryl Loar, Reed was arrested after the chase ended in a crash in Warren County, north of Cincinnati. An officer had tried to initiate a traffic stop when Reed allegedly drove away. Subject of a nationwide manhunt, Reed had been on the lam for nearly a week. \"Rondell Reed is very smart. He is not a stupid crook,\" said Indian County Det. Steven Stoll. \"He is very good at auto theft. It's what he did growing up. He knows how. \" Authorities believe Reed was headed for Indiana, where he has family. Loar told reporters earlier this week that the suspect stole a vehicle, likely in the Sebastian area. The vehicle that crashed Saturday may have been a different one, officials said. Reed had been arrested in the death of an Indian County business owner, WPBF said . In Ohio, Reed faces charges of receiving stolen property, failure to comply with a police officer, carrying a concealed weapon and having a weapon under disability, according to Cincinnati affiliate WLWT and Warren County's website. Loar said corrections deputies performed hourly checks of Reed and Taylor in their cells, but items they used to create dummies gave the appearance that they were tucked in their sheets when in fact they were making their getaway, WPBF reported. \"The River County Jail has been hardened again, not only after the immediate escape, (but) continuing through this week,\" Loar told reporters Saturday. \"This incident will not happen again under my command.\"",

        "document": "Think of five children you know. One of them may suffer from a serious debilitating mental illness. If this child is your own, finding answers to the question \"How can I help my child?\" can be daunting and overwhelming. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 20% of Americans under the age of 18 live with or have experienced a seriously debilitating mental disorder. And unfortunately many of those suffering from mental illness ultimately choose suicide as the  way out. According to the Centers for Disease Control, suicide is ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in Americans over the age of 10. Gesine Sauter, a licensed mental health counselor at the Karen Horney Clinic in Manhattan, says suicide is the third-leading cause of death among people ages 15-24. But there are ways to help and resources available if you feel a loved one might be suicidal. \"If you detect any of the risk factors and you are concerned about someone, always directly ask if he or she feels suicidal. You do not plant any suicidal thoughts or bring the other [person] closer to taking action. Just the opposite: being asked can be the first step or chance for the suicidal individual to experience a sense of relief just by being able to share some of his or her anguish and feeling less alone,\" Sauter says. While a diagnosis of mental illness or disorder of any level of severity can seem overwhelming to a parent, there are resources available to support families on their journey through diagnosis and treatment. Here are just a few: . The Balanced Mind Foundation offers support and for parents and guardians of children with mood disorders. The nonprofit provides online support groups, a professional resource directory, and a family helpline where families can submit questions to trained parent volunteers. They have twenty-eight support groups listed on their website that address the needs of all ages from toddler to what they call \"transition age\" or in their twenties suffering from depression or bipolar disorder as well as their family members. The goal of the Balanced Mind Foundation is to see these children thrive in spite of their disorders because they are receiving the proper care and support they deserve. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides a Peer-to-Peer Recovery Educational program geared toward healthy living strategies and skill-building resources for adults. The course is free, confidential and led by trained individuals in recovery from mental illness. They also facilitate a discussion group called Teen Consumers, which provides a healthy environment for teens to discuss their diagnoses and treatments. NAMI has a support group for parents of teens with mental illness, as well. The nonprofit's website also provides a state-by-state directory of local support groups. NAMI offers an information hotline for general information, referrals and support: 1-800-950-6264. Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on weekdays. The Autism Society's  approach is to focus on each individual child's needs. They preach a message that no method is the right method for all children diagnosed with autism. Their goal is to provide parents with many options and different avenues of advice and support. The Autism Society created  Autism Source, a comprehensive database of local professional services. Visitors to the website can explore a wide range of resources, including housing needs, medical professionals and educational services. The Treatment Advocacy Center is a nonprofit that works to promote policies that support people with severe mental illness. The website features a link that connects these families and individuals to treatment options, legal resources and crisis response strategies. The Arc is a national community-based organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. In their mission statement, the team from the Arc promotes a people-first approach and \"believes that all people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are defined by their own strengths, abilities and inherent value, not by their disability.\" The strive to make those affected and their families' lives better through policy, support systems and education.",

Caught on camera: Julie Peters was filmed carrying shopping bags (pictured) and making deliveries despite claiming £11,000 of disability benefits . A grandmother, who claimed she could not walk, has been caught on camera delivering sandwiches despite receiving £11,000 in disability benefits. Julie Peters, 56, who runs Victoria Sandwich in Horwich, Bolton, Greater Manchester, was filmed making deliveries and carrying shopping bags, after telling the Department of Work and Pensions she could not walk and claiming benefits for seven years. The woman from Breightmet, Bolton, was convicted of dishonestly claiming disability living allowance at Manchester City Magistrates' Court, and will be sentenced later after she was caught following a tip-off. Peters told The Bolton News six years ago that she beat depression following breast cancer surgery by launching the sandwich business with her daughter, Vicki. Despite bouncing back from breast cancer she became depressed but she said her new business venture had helped her beat the illness. Victoria Sandwich's website prides itself as being staffed by ‘some of the nicest people you will meet’. The firm specialises in eat-ins takeaways and buffets. After she opened the business, Peters said: ‘Vicki and I decided to get a place of our own together, and this gave me a real purpose in life. Claimed for seven years: Peters (pictured with daughter in front of her business Victoria Sandwich) was convicted of dishonestly claiming disability living allowance because she said she could not walk . ‘When I was at my lowest, I just needed to keep strong and positive and find a way forward - I never dreamed that I'd cook up the answer myself.’ Lord Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform said: ‘Benefit thieves are costing the taxpayer £1.2 billion per year. ‘This money is intended to help those most in need not line the pockets of criminals.

Her sentencing comes as Patrick Wildman, 47, was convicted after he was caught working as a delivery driver while  claiming he could not walk, pocketing £27,000 in benefits. The former bus driver, who uses a wheelchair was secretly filmed walking around Plymouth, has now been convicted of benefit fraud after pocketing benefits money for over seven years.",

It might not be many people's idea of a place to call home. But the pub where Adolf Hitler was born in the Austrian town of Branau-am-Inn could now be turned into flats after developers submitted plans to the local council. The mayor of Braunau, Hannes Waidbacher, who opposes  alternative proposals for a Holocaust museum at the site, believes turning the Gasthaus zum Pommer into family homes would be one way of 'destigmatising' the town. Plans: Developers want to turn the former Gasthaus zum Pommer where Hitler was born (pictured) into apartments . As it was: Pictured in 1966, the building had been, variously, a girl's school and a public library, after World War II. Most recently it has been used as a centre for disabled people . Nationality: Hitler's birthplace is just a short distance from the German border. The Nazi leader returned to annex and occupy his homeland during the 'Anschluss' in 1938 . If the plan- approved by the mayor and proposed by a local building consortium - was accepted it would mean the room where Hitler was born would become a bedroom in self-contained apartments with state-of-the-art kitchens and bathrooms. The apartments would go on the market for an estimated 400,000 pounds each. Such a plan, say experts, would require vigorous vetting of prospective buyers to ensure that a single flat - or indeed the entire property - did not fall into the hands of neo-Nazis masking their real identities. The little Austrian town separated from Germany by a short bridge over the River Inn, is still visited by hordes of far-right fanatics each year who come to pay homage at the site where the future Fuhrer was born on April 20 1889. It was until recently used as a workshop for the mentally and physically disabled; the sort of people Hitler deemed as 'useless eaters' and the first to die in the Third Reich's secret euthanasia campaign before WWII. But it has been empty for a year now with the state picking up the bill for the lease and a debate raging about what to do with the two-storey listed building. Mayor Waidbacher said: 'Braunau has done much to process its history over the years. 'It is not necessary to build a Holocaust museum in the house as some have suggested. 'Braunau as a town is already stigmatised enough. 'Hitler spent only three years of his life here, and they were certainly not the most formative years of his life. 'Why should I or others take responsibility for him? I was born 21 years after the end of the war.' The mayor said he was open to all suggestions, saying Braunau wants an 'affordable solution for all.' 'I can imagine all possibilities for the house,' he said. Marker: A memorial stone (pictured) was placed outside the building in 1989 as a reminder of its history. In English the inscription reads 'For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Remind [us]' Past: Mayor Hannes Waidbacher supports the plan for apartments - saying it would help 'de-stigmatise' the town . However, Mayor Waidbacjer is against turning the building into a 'House of Peace' or a 'House of Responsibility' as Green Party members have advocated - believing the town has done enough atoning over the years for its most infamous son. Already the newspapers in Austria and Germany are having a field day at the prospect of flats in Hitler's house. 'In the future you can live like Adolf Hitler,' said the Austrian newspaper Heute while the salzburger Nachrichten said; 'Hitler's home to become apartment block.' The house at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 is estimated to be worth about £2.5 million to £3 million. It was in a room on the first floor of the three-storey, 2,000 square foot premises that Hitler’s mother Klara gave birth to the future Nazi leader. She and her husband Alois, a stern local customs official, rented a suite of rooms above the pub and continued to live in it until 1892 when they moved to Linz. Alois, a drunkard, often availed himself of the beer on sale in the saloon downstairs before returning to the family home to abuse his timid wife who was 24 years his junior. The house is still owned by the family after which the pub took its name. Braunau LOCATOR.jpg . Owner Gelinde Pommer says she wants to sell because she no longer wants to have responsibility for it. Nothing remains inside the building to indicate its link with Hitler, not even the bedroom where he was born. The only Nazi-era relic is on an iron gate outside, the initials MB for Hitler’s party secretary Martin Bormann, who had them placed there when he declared the house a national monument after Hitler took over Austria in 1938. During the 12 year lifespan of the Third Reich it was a must-see place of pilgrimage for loyal Nazis. Bormann bought the house with Nazi funds and made it a cultural centre which displayed Nazi-approved art. It was given back to the Pommer family in 1952 and served as the town’s public library until 1965 before becoming, in turns, a school, a bank, a technical institute and finally the home and workshop for disabled people. Those who want it turned into a site of remembrance for Hitler's crimes are pressing central government in Vienna to compulsorily purchase the property.",

        "document": "Pregnant women at risk of mental health problems will receive extra support after the tragic deaths of a new mother Charlotte Bevan (pictured) and her four-day-old daughter . Pregnant women at risk of mental health problems will receive extra support after the tragic deaths of a new mother and her four-day-old daughter. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says women who experience or are at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at every stage of their pregnancy, and after their baby is born. Nice’s 'wide-ranging' updated guideline comes two weeks after Charlotte Bevan, 30, went missing from a maternity hospital in Bristol with her four-day-old daughter at 9pm on December 2. Search teams found the body of Ms Bevan, who is believed to have suffered from depression and schizophrenia, on the Avon Gorge on December 3, and her daughter Zaani Tiana the following day. Around 12 per cent of women experience depression and 13 per cent suffer anxiety at some point during and after pregnancy, with many experiencing both. One in five women is affected by depression and anxiety in the first year after childbirth. There is an increased risk of psychosis in the weeks after childbirth. Women may also experience disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, tokophobia - an extreme fear of childbirth - and eating disorders. The update will help doctors, nurses, health visitors and midwives identify mental health problems in mothers and mothers-to-be. It also offers guidance on the most appropriate drugs or other treatments to safely offer mother and child. Women who have had mental health problems will be advised what help should be available to them if they are planning to have a baby. The guidance states women and their partners who have experienced a traumatic event such as a very difficult birth should be offered extra support. There are also clear recommendations about what should be offered to mothers who have suffered a miscarriage or whose baby is still-born. Search teams found the body of Ms Bevan, who is believed to have suffered from depression and schizophrenia, on the Avon Gorge (pictured) on December 3, and her daughter Zaani Tiana the following day . 'Mental health problems during and after pregnancy are common,' said Nice Centre for Clinical Practice director Professor Mark Baker. 'More than one in 10 women will experience depression at some point during their pregnancy. This increases to one in five women during the first year after giving birth. 'During pregnancy and the postnatal period, women may also experience other mental health problems. Giving women the right treatment at the right time can have a profound effect - not just for the mother, but her family too. The effect of getting this right can last for years. 'The guidance makes a number of new and updated recommendations, covering not only treatments, but also in providing women who are newly diagnosed or with a history of mental health problems with the information and support they need before they become pregnant.' Ms Bevan, pictured on hospital CCTV, went missing from a maternity hospital in Bristol with her four-day-old daughter Zaani Tiana at 9pm on December 2 . Nice says the guidelines have been updated thanks to more information becoming available on using drugs to treat mental health problems during pregnancy, and on stopping medication. More is also known about detecting mental health problems in mothers and pregnant women. Professor Stephen Pilling, Professor of Clinical Psychology and Clinical Effectiveness at UCL and facilitator of the group that developed the guideline, said: 'Having a baby is a time of huge change and any woman can find herself needing help. This updated guideline is about spotting what is not normal for each woman and making sure she gets the right treatment. 'Women with a history of mental health problems are at risk of relapse when they become pregnant, especially if they stop taking their medication. 'Drugs often have an important role in treating antenatal and postnatal mental health problems, but they are not always suitable and so we have again emphasised the need for rapid access to effective psychological interventions. 'It is critically important that a woman is able to make an informed decision about treatment and she is helped to weigh up the risks and benefits of stopping, starting or changing any treatment she is offered or currently receiving.' Mother-of-two Maria Bavette, co-founder of Maternal OCD, experienced postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder and helped to develop the new Nice recommendations. 'Being pregnant and/or a new mum can often be challenging, with a perinatal mental health problem it can be incredibly difficult,' she said. 'I believe this guideline will help to de-stigmatise mental health problems during the perinatal period and encourage all healthcare professionals at every point of contact with a mum to talk about their mental health as well as their physical health. 'Mothers especially need looking after so they can in turn care for themselves and their baby - this guideline sets out which treatments are recommended for mild, moderate to severe maternal mental health problems and needs to be utilised by all healthcare professionals.' The updated guideline makes recommendations for the recognition, care and treatment of mental health problems in women during pregnancy and the postnatal period. It also includes the care of women with an existing mental health problem who are planning a pregnancy, and the organisation of mental health services. Rachael Dobson, co-founder and chief executive of Pandas (Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support), said the guideline highlighted the importance of individualised care for women. 'I welcome these new guidelines as an aid to assisting doctors, midwives, health visitors and nurses identify mental health illnesses in pregnant women and mothers, which will allow the illnesses to be treated and supported earlier thus helping to lower the impact both on women and the wider family unit,' she added. The guideline are available on the Nice website from today. Dr Patrick O’Brien, spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: 'We welcome these revised guidelines on antenatal and postnatal mental health. They come at a time when perinatal health services are in the spotlight. 'Many women experience low mood following childbirth; however, this is normal and should pass. However, women who have pre-existing mental health conditions, or who develop a more serious mental health condition antenatally or postnatally need specialist attention and care. Mental illness makes a significant contribution to maternal deaths and therefore it is vital these women receive the right support at the right time by the right professional. 'We cannot over-emphasise the importance of early identification and reaching women pre-conceptually, especially because women with pre-existing mental health disorders are at a greater risk. Healthcare professionals need to ensure that these women receive the best possible care. 'There is also a need to consider the training and support needs of professionals in order to develop better services for women. They need to be aware that this group of vulnerable women may not want to tell anyone about their condition and, if this is the case, they need to know the correct care pathways to follow. 'An integrated care plan should be developed for a woman with a mental health problem in pregnancy and the postnatal periods that sets out the treatment options and the roles of all healthcare professionals.' Recommendations in the updated guidelines on support for antenatal and postnatal women who experience or are at risk of mental health problems are wide-ranging. They include: . Considerations for women of childbearing potential: Discuss with all women of childbearing potential who have a new, existing or past mental health problem: . The use of contraception and any plans for a pregnancy . Treatment decisions, advice and monitoring for women who are planning a pregnancy, pregnant or in the postnatal period: Mental health professionals providing detailed advice about the possible risks of mental health problems or the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnancy and the postnatal period should include discussion of the following, depending on individual circumstances: . Starting, using and stopping treatment: Before starting any treatment in pregnancy and the postnatal period, discuss with the woman the higher threshold for pharmacological interventions arising from the changing risk-benefit ratio for psychotropic medication at this time and the likely benefits of a psychological intervention. Pharmaceutical interventions: When choosing a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or (serotonin-) noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor [(S)NRI] , take into account the reproductive safety and the uncertainty about whether any increased risk to the foetus and other problems for the woman or baby. Traumatic birth, stillbirth and miscarriage: Discuss with a woman whose baby is stillborn or dies soon after birth, and her partner and family, the option of one or more of the following: . This should be facilitated by an experienced practitioner and the woman and her partner and family should be offered a follow-up appointment in primary or secondary care. If it is known that the baby has died in utero, this discussion should take place before the delivery, and continue after delivery if needed.",

        "document": "By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 20 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 21 July 2013 . When a loved one needs help, perhaps during illness or long-term incapacity, stepping in to help is an instinct. Six million Britons are carers to an adult, and every day a further 6,000 take on that huge responsibility. But where do carers find the help and advice they need when the often complex network of health and welfare services can be daunting? To support them, the British Medical Association has released a Carer’s Manual. Here, in the first of three extracts from it, we explore the initial steps to becoming a carer... Providing a helping hand: Six million Britons are carers to an adult, often a family member who suffers from a long-term health problem . MAKE CARING A CHOICE . If your partner or parent  needs care, your role as carer may develop gradually and unconsciously – but taking on the commitment ought to be an  active decision. Talk it over with family members and the person’s doctor. Consider how it will affect you and others in your household. It  is important to discuss the situation with your family and make a decision together. You must consult the person needing care, too; their approval will make your role in looking after them easier. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS . It can be difficult to care for someone while also holding down a job, but most employees have statutory rights, including the right to request flexible working hours and unpaid leave in emergencies. Your employer may offer you a sabbatical or part-time hours. Anyone being cared for is entitled to a needs assessment (also called a community care assessment) to analyse their abilities and make sure they are safe. To arrange this, contact social services or the person’s GP. Helping hand: As thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative, a manual has been released to help them get of the ground . MAKE HOME SAFE . Most people needing care prefer to stay in their own home and familiar surroundings. An occupational therapist can advise how to make the environment safe and adapt the home. Caring for someone from a distance is difficult but can be done – try to create an organised pattern of care that can be shared with other people. A telecare alarm system, which uses sensors around the home that will alert a call centre if the person has a fall, can reduce worry if someone lives alone. Only move somebody in with you when you have fully thought through how well you get on, how your privacy will change and how much it will alter your lives. CHANGED RELATIONSHIPS . The role reversal of caring for a frail parent can be distressing for both parties. Similarly, becoming your partner’s carer will change your relationship. It is normal to feel not just sad but angry and resentful because your future may not be the one you planned.Caring for a friend or neighbour to whom you are less close can also feel awkward, especially if personal care is necessary. The most important thing in all scenarios is to find others to help, such as family members or social services. Being uncomfortable can lead to resentment and harm the relationship. There are support groups you can join.  Try Carer’s UK (carersuk.org, 0808 808 7777), Crossroads Care (crossroadscaring.com, 0151 343 1960), and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers (carers.org,  0844 800 4361). Local councils also run support groups. You are not alone: Finding a care assistant can relieve some of the burden from a family member and can give day-to-day practical help and advice . LOOK AFTER NO 1, TOO . With the focus on someone else’s health, it is easy to forget your own. But carers are much more likely to suffer ill health than other people, statistics show. However short of time you feel,  it is important you attend all your own medical appointments and keep track of your health. Make sure you eat properly and that you get enough sleep. Exercise can be combined with caring – find out about mobility scooters or wheelchairs if the person you’re caring for can’t walk far. Yoga and chair or floor exercises could suit you both and be done together at home. Make sure you don’t become socially isolated. Set up a rota of people to visit you regularly and talk about your day and situation so friends understand better. If you’re tired, tearful, easily irritated and find it hard to concentrate, it may be time to speak to your GP about referral to a counsellor. PLAN EACH DAY . Planning your day can make you feel more in control. Prioritise tasks and delegate those you can. Being overtired is a major contributor to stress, so build in rest time for yourself. Give yourself a treat each week and do small enjoyable things daily, such as taking a long bath, listening to a favourite radio programme or seeing a friend. None of this is selfish; by tending to your own needs you will feel more positive and energetic and be able to offer better care. FIND A HELPING HAND . A care assistant can give day-to-day practical help, such as washing and dressing, making meals and helping the person to the toilet. They can visit twice a day, all day or overnight, or even move in full-time. Find a care assistant through your local social services department, which will recommend agencies. You may be able to get funding for a care assistant from your local authority, based on the community care assessment. You may also be entitled to financial help with your own costs, such as travel or housing, if you spend more than 35 hours a week caring for another adult who receives disability benefits. Even if you have help, you will occasionally need a complete break from caring. That means either getting someone to take over full-time care or arranging a residential home. There is also day centre care, enabling you to have days away, and respite holidays with specialist organisations. Contact Age UK (ageuk.org.uk, 0800 169 6565) or advice line Carers Direct (0808 808 0202) to find a local service. The British Medical Association Carer’s Manual is published by DK, priced £14.99.

        "document": "Created: . 06:45 EST, 6 May 2014 . A Harley Street nutritionist has been fined after claiming his fitness regime could combat cancer. Former bodybuilder Dr Stephen Ferguson, 45, provided a range of protein shakes and multivitamin drinks, which had 'cured' two of his clients. The health food range could also heal epilepsy, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis, according to his website. With 300 video testimonials from satisfied clients on the website, The Natural Health Clinic enjoyed a turnover of £70,000 in its first year of business. The Harley Street nutritionist told the court he did not know how the word 'cured' came to appear on his website . But today, Dr Ferguson was fined £1,750 for violating the Cancer Act. The act was designed to protect vulnerable people from unprofessional advice. Sentencing, District Judge Adrian Turner told . Hammersmith Magistrate's Court: 'The written material refers to cancer, . with a link to the clinic. 'It is plainly implied this is someone who . treats cancer. 'Any member of the public would believe this is someone who has treated and in two cases cured cancer. 'I’m . satisfied Dr Ferguson was fully involved with everything that’s on his . site and anyone reading this would have no doubt this was an offer of . services for those seeking treatment for cancer. 'I’m . in no doubt those YouTube testimonials are a major part of the . company’s business in treating cancer and Dr Ferguson’s approach to the . Cancer Act has been a head in the sand one.' District Judge Adrian Turner at Hammersmith Magistrate's Court ruled that Dr Ferguson was 'fully involved' Vitamin C capsules sold on Dr . Ferguson's website were captioned with the testimonial: 'Many have said . it helps them get rid of cancer.' Other . products included Multivitamin PH Balancer, Blood Cleanser & Energy . Booster and a Tropical Fruit Whey Protein Powder, which were advertised . as cures for the life-threatening disease, as well as for asthma, . arthritis, and diabetes. It was also implied the clinic was involved in the successful treatment of a patient with prostate cancer. The business flourished between June 17 and October 2 last year, until the council received a complaint. In . a bid to distance himself from the website's content, and video adverts . uploaded to YouTube, Dr Ferguson told the court a female employee was . responsible. 'She was meant to stick to specific guidelines and not put on anything about treating cancer or anything like that,' he said. 'She was asked not to include her own personal views on there. 'I . know it should not say anything that says we are treating cancer. It’s . purely for diet and fitness and exercise and nothing else.' Acknowledging a video strap line that included the word 'cured' for a Merkel cell tumour treatment, Dr Ferguson told the court: 'I don’t know how it got there.' He denied uploading the YouTube content to a page owned by username ‘SFSTEVE100’, and claimed not to know who did. 'I don’t write on my website, I have other people update it for me. I was checking the website, but obviously not everything that went on there, there’s three thousand pages,' he added. The judge also ordered Dr Ferguson to pay £2,500 costs and a £120 victim surcharge, telling him: 'You are not accused of quackery, no one is saying you are not a qualified nutritionist. 'These are reckless offences, not a deliberate attempt by you to exploit the vulnerable.'",

        "document": "Heather Kern's heart had raced ever since she was 11. It would randomly speed up at times and then drop back to normal. But those quirks didn't stop her from lacing up her boots for a hike every weekend or jumping in the pool for a long swim -- at least until she gave birth to her little girl in August 2008. That's when her heart changed. Two weeks after delivering her daughter Cindy, Kern realized something was very wrong. The 32-year-old began experiencing numbness in her limbs and had severe chest pain. \"My heart felt like a Ping-Pong ball -- it was going crazy speeding up and slowing down,\" she remembers. Kern went to see a cardiologist in their new home state of Texas. She didn't know what to expect; for years doctors had shrugged off her symptoms. She was stunned to learn that her problems were caused by heart disease. The new mother had a left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, a congenital disorder that affects a small percentage of people. With LVNC, muscle fibers in the lower left chamber of the heart do not turn into solid muscle as they should during normal development. Instead the fibers remain and interfere with the heart's function. Kern's cardiologist suspected that she also had Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, an abnormal heart rhythm disorder that could potentially cause sudden cardiac arrest. The diagnosis sent her into a spiral of depression. \"I thought I was going to die,\" she says. She had already put on 40 pounds during pregnancy and was now being told she couldn't do anything active that would strain her heart. Life became a series of tests and checkups, shuffling in and out of the hospital. She had to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implanted, and was put on heart medication to regulate her life-threatening arrhythmias.  Eventually, Kern started seeing a counselor to deal with the emotional pain. \"That first year with my daughter, I couldn't enjoy her because I was having problems, and I was sick,\" she says. As she tried to cope with her new reality, she turned to food. Over the next four years, her weight ballooned. Food, inactivity and even her heart medicine caused her to put on weight. And her growing waistline was not helping her self esteem. She became so heavy she couldn't bear to step on the scale and refused to pose in photographs with friends. At the start of 2012, she came across a weight-loss challenge on a couponing website. The challenge was between a group of strangers online who counted calories to lose weight. It didn't seem like something that would strain her heart, so Kern decided to join the group's challenge. \"I thought I'd try losing weight with people online. I figured if I fail it's not as bad because I don't really know them,\" she says. So she cut her food intake by 500 calories a day, eating only 1,200 calories and religiously documented everything she put in her mouth. A chocolate lover, she got rid of all candy from her house. And she stopped eating after her daughter. \"Oh the French fries -- my kid with her Happy Meals would drive me crazy,\" she says. \"I would eat half her meal because she couldn't finish it.\" But with calorie counting, there was no room for extra food. She weighed in at 260 pounds at the start of the challenge. In six weeks she had dropped 20 pounds, winning the weight-loss competition. It was a boost of confidence that motivated her to take control of her life. She was determined to get to a healthy weight not only for herself, but also for her daughter. \"My mom and grandfather both died in their forties because of this, and they didn't know they had heart disease,\" she said. \"A lot of people have the same kind of thing I have. It's like a totally different ball game when you're trying to lose weight.\" She made counting calories a routine, logging her intake on sites like caloriecount.com or on her mobile phone. But she wanted to do more. She wanted to be active but didn't know how. She asked her cardiologist about light exercise; he thought it would be a good idea to try. So Kern strapped on her tennis shoes and put Cindy in a stroller and walked down the street. That was as far as she would go. The fear that her heart would act up made her turn around. But those first few steps were just the beginning. She slowly built the courage to walk a little further each day around her neighborhood, paying close attention to her body. Soon, she was able to jump on the elliptical for five minutes at a time, building up her endurance. \"You got to go slowly,\" she says. Losing weight was gradual for Kern, who is 5'8\". It took her two years to reach her goal weight of 135 pounds on October 2013. Kern, who started a new job at a patient advocacy company, now focuses on maintaining her weight. She joined a gym to build muscle and goes every day. She still lives with her heart condition, but losing the weight has helped keep her heath in check. \"Some days I go to the gym and my heart isn't cooperating. It feels like it is rattling around,\" she says. \"You never push yourself with this disease. They tell you to push yourself at the gym, but you have to listen to your body.\" Kern currently takes only half her heart medication. Her cardiologist attributes her improved health to her weight loss. She says the entire process changed the way she views life. \"When I was diagnosed with heart disease, I literally thought that my life was over,\" she said. \"But the huge weight-loss proved to me I could still do what I set my mind to. Life wasn't over; it could be wonderful.\"",

        "document": "By . Lizzie Edmonds . Angela Wegg, pictured, pocketed £43,000 in disability allowance by claiming she struggled to dress and cook for herself. However, she was actually working two jobs . A mother who claimed £43,000 in benefits by saying she needed help washing and dressing was working two jobs in a bakery and a nursing home, a court heard. Angela Wegg, 34, from Ipswich, Suffolk, told authorities her disability meant she needed help washing, dressing and cooking meals. In a claim form for Disability Living Allowance, the mother-of-two said she struggled with mobility - and could only walk one to three metres. But Department of Work and Pensions investigators launched an urgent probe after receiving a tip-off she had two jobs. Investigators discovered that Wegg . had been working in the bakery at a Tesco store in Ipswich as well as . at the town’s Monmouth Court care home. They also saw Wegg walking over two miles with her two German Shepherd dogs as well as walking her children to school without using an aid. The court heard how Wegg, who suffers from a syndrome which affects connective tissues in her body, pocketed £43,000 over a period of seven years by failing to notify the authorities her health had improved. Wegg admitted dishonestly failing to notify a change in her circumstances between November 2005 and June 2013. Sentencing her, Judge David Goodin said Wegg had the 'dreadful misfortune' to suffer from a hereditary illness. But . he said although her original Disability Living Allowance was . genuine, she had failed to notify the authorities when she became able to . work and walk more than three metres or about 10 feet. Wegg was given a four-month prison sentence suspended for 12 months . and ordered to attend a Women’s Emotional Well Being course. Wegg had no previous convictions - and was ordered to repay the . amount she had been overpaid in £20-a-month installments. Ipswich Crown Court heard how Wegg's secret employment proved she did not need the benefits she was being handed. Marcus Croskell, prosecuting, said both her jobs were physically demanding. He added: 'Part of these duties involved bending, stretching, walking and carrying items.' The court was told how Wegg was prescribed oral morphine by her GP to control her pain last November. Despite claiming she could only walk one to three metres, the mother-of-one was holding down two jobs - one at a Tesco bakery and another at Monmouth Court Care Home, pictured . However, Declan Gallagher, defending, accepted that Wegg’s capabilities became greater than she had declared. He added she hadn’t been living an 'extravagant lifestyle' and her jobs had only paid the minimum wage. A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later in the year. A DWP spokesman said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime and, if convicted, you will be handed a criminal record and be ordered to pay back the money. 'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.' Wegg, who suffers from a condition that affects connective tissue in her body, failed to notify authorities when her condition improved, the court was told. She fraudulently claimed £43,000 over seven years - and was handed a four month suspended sentence .",

        "document": "Furious: Susan Tanner, 37, was kicked off a Stagecoach bus with her two children because her 15-month-old toddler, Tommy (above), was crying . A mother and her two children were heartlessly thrown off a Stagecoach bus because her 15-month-old toddler would not stop crying. Susan Tanner, 37, caught the bus with her youngest son, Tommy, and his six-year-old brother, Frankie, from their home in New Romney, Kent. She was planning to take the 35-minute journey to Folkestone so that she could buy clothes for her eldest son ahead of his first day at school next week. But when her youngest, Tommy, began to bawl two miles from the family's intended destination, the driver decided he had heard enough and kicked them off the bus and on to the street. Miss Tanner is furious about the incident and claimed: 'The driver said \"Do you need some time out?\" I asked what he meant. 'He then said \"Do you need to get off the bus because the baby is crying?\" 'I said no, and I asked the other passengers if the baby was disturbing them. None of them said so. 'The driver then said \"It's disturbing me and I would like you to get off the bus\". 'Frankie was so upset because he didn't understand why his mum was thrown off the bus. 'I am still in shock. I couldn't believe it.' After being ditched in Sandgate village, just five minutes drive from Folkestone, Miss Tanner was forced to call her partner for a lift - despite the fact that she had already paid £6.40 in bus fares. After eventually being dropped off in Folkestone, the mother-of-two marched straight to the bus station to complain - only to be told she would have to sit and fill out a complaint form if she wanted to get a refund. A Stagecoach spokesman said the driver's action was strongly against company policy. He said: 'We were very concerned to hear about this incident. Stranded: After being thrown from the Stagecoach bus (like the one pictured), Miss Tanner had to call her partner for a lift . 'We have carried out an investigation to find out what happened and can confirm that one of our drivers suggested Ms Tanner alight the bus. 'This is definitely not part of any company procedure or policy and we would like to offer Miss Tanner our sincere apologies for our driver's actions. 'We will take appropriate action to prevent this from ever happening again. 'We have not yet received Ms Tanner's formal complaint, but when we do we will reiterate this apology to her directly.' It is not the first time Stagecoach has received complaints over its treatment of passengers. In August, a mother from Cardiff claimed that one of their drivers refused to help her find a seat for her toddler, who has cerebral palsy - despite her explaining his condition. Alisha Frost, 24, was forced to sit on the floor while holding her brain damaged son, Jack, in her arms.",

        "document": "New York (CNN) -- Five-year-old Anthony Smith didn't think superheroes wore hearing aids, until he became one. His mother, Christina D'Allesandro, says the epic journey began in May, when her superhero-fanatic son, who is deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other, refused to wear his blue hearing aid because \"superheroes don't wear hearing aids\" either. Desperate, she decided to consult the experts. She found a general e-mail address on the Marvel Comics website and sent a message \"into the ethers,\" asking if there were any hearing-impaired superheroes. A few weeks later, the mother of two was shocked to get an overwhelming response from Marvel, including comic book art that honored her son. \"When he first saw the comic book cover, he said, 'Oh my God, it's me,' \" she told CNN. \"He was very excited.\" \"We decided to make him an honorary Avenger,\" a member of the Marvel Comics superhero crime-fighting team, said Bill Rosemann, a Marvel editor. Two artists, Manny Mederos and Nelson Ribeiro, sent the D'Allesandro family comic book covers featuring their very own versions of honorary Avenger Blue Ear, inspired by Anthony, whose blue earpiece gives him the power to hear a pin drop from the other side of a state. One cover features a younger Anthony and his buddy Hawkeye ready to fight crime. The other shows an older version of Blue Ear perched on a rooftop, tapping into his superpower and listening to a faraway call for help. On Tuesday, the young New Hampshire boy is being welcomed as a special guest at an event at the Center for Hearing and Communication clinic in New York City, where he will get to meet a fellow crime-fighting partner in the Marvel universe, Iron Man. \"The reason why it was so easy for us to respond to this is because our characters, which were invented around the '60s, all have real challenges.\" Rosemann said. He talked about how all the characters \"became superheroes despite of -- or because of -- the challenges they face.\" Under his elastic Spidey skin is a skinny Peter Parker, who constantly gets picked on at school, Rosemann said. As a boy, superhero Daredevil was blinded in an accident that also gave him a radar sense. And Iron Man first created armor to fix his heart, and he then developed the armor into his famous suit. \"We link challenges with their superpowers,\" Rosemann said. \"Our mantra is what (Marvel Comics chief) Stan Lee said: With great power there must come great responsibility. Our guys thought, 'If I have the ability to draw, I am going to use it to help someone like Anthony feel comfortable about his hearing aid.' \" Rosemann and his team collaborated with Phonak, the maker of Anthony's hearing aid, and came up with a poster to be distributed in doctors' offices across the country in an effort to destigmatize kids with hearing aids. The poster, to be unveiled at Tuesday's special event, features none other than fearless Iron Man, whose message is that kids who use hearing aids are just like him because \"they are using technology to be their best self.\" \"It will be an Iron Man and Blue Ear team-up,\" Rosemann said about the event. Closer to home, all the attention has brought excitement and meaning for Anthony and his mother. \"In this house, we are looking forward to meeting Iron Man,\" D'Allesandro said. \"He is a big Avengers fan.\" The experience has given Anthony the confidence and the ability to talk about his disability, she said. \"He goes up to kids and says, 'Hey, I have a little ear and a blue ear. Do you want to play?' \" People have reached out to her, and she says her family is grateful that this experience has connected her and her son to a wonderful network of families with special needs children. When asked if there is a comic book series on the horizon featuring Blue Ear, Rosemann said, \"There is nothing planned right now, but with so many people responding to Blue Ear, you never know what's next ...\" \"People should just stay tuned.\"",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the \"People's Princess.\" Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. \"There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,\" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. Despite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an \"ordinary\" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals. \"She was quite a lovable child,\" Crane said. \"She was very, very cuddly.\"  Watch Crane share her memories of the young Diana » . Inside Park House, however, the marriage of Diana's parents was falling apart. The divorce was finalized in 1969. Clarke said the failed marriage had a resounding effect on Diana. \"When Diana walked towards me at school, she had these downcast eyes,\" Clarke said of their first meeting, when Diana was just 9. Diana's broken home made her feel different from her classmates, Clarke said. Divorce was uncommon at that time in England. Even more unusual -- Diana's father got custody of their four children. Nearly 40 years later, Clarke still remembers their first conversation. \"She said, 'I will never marry unless I'm really in love because if you're not in love, you're going to get divorced -- and I never intend to be divorced,' \" Clarke said. \"This was quite a profound statement for a little girl to come out with.\" \"Diana's dreams all through her childhood really were just to be happily married and to have a large family,\" Clarke said. Her dream, specifically, was to marry Prince Charles, 12 years her elder. While other 13-year-olds loved pop stars, Diana's boarding school room was decorated with pictures of Charles.  See family photos as CNN's Soledad O'Brien recounts friends' stories of Diana » . The young child's dreams seemingly came true when she married him just seven years later, but, like her parents' relationship, her marriage unraveled. From that first candid conversation about her aspirations, Clarke and the future princess of Wales connected. \"We always clicked from the word go,\" Clarke said. \"We worked together as a team.\" Clarke had heard rumors about a mischievous Diana -- how a flurry of nannies had come and gone, including the one she locked in a bathroom. But, Clarke said, the Diana she knew never gave her \"any headaches whatsoever.\" Clarke, who was 21 and had no previous experience, was given \"sole charge\" of Diana and her younger brother Charles. Diana often helped around the house and was especially nurturing toward Charles. Charles would describe his sister as the \"very essence of compassion\" at her funeral. Diana's motherly instincts were evident as she matured. As a teenager, she would become a nanny, then an assistant kindergarten teacher, and then a mother of two sons, William and Harry. Clarke remembers observing Diana's impartial love at a young age. She played with children from royalty as well as children from the village. \"They were all treated completely as equals, which is why I feel that in Diana's adult life, she ... found it so easy to interact and to mix with everyone, because to her, each person was an individual,\" Clarke said. Diana would become famous for that openness. She was photographed holding hands with a patient who was HIV positive in 1987 -- when many still believed the virus could be spread by touch. Diana devoted herself to her volunteer work, visiting the sick and campaigning for an international ban on landmines. Even as a teenager visiting patients at a mental hospital, she bonded with people -- ordinary people, disabled people -- in a way no other student could. In his funeral oration, Charles said his sister told him \"it was her innermost feelings of suffering that made it possible for her to connect with her constituency of the rejected.\" She remained, he said, a \"very insecure person at heart.\" As the Princess of Wales, Diana captivated the world with the same qualities that stood out to her nannies -- her affection, her vulnerability and her private misery. These qualities changed the face of the monarchy, and they keep the shy girl from a broken home just as much in the public eye, a decade after her death. E-mail to a friend .

        "document": "(CNN) -- Alyssa O'Neill sent a text to her mother earlier this month asking her whether she would take her to get a pumpkin spice latte the next day. Although her mother agreed, Alyssa was never able to try the drink. On September 4, the morning she was supposed to get the treat, the 18-year-old died of an epileptic seizure. \"We were just shocked at the sudden loss and didn't know what to do,\" her father, Jason O'Neill, said. \"So we tried to fulfill the one thing that she asked us. If Alyssa couldn't get a pumpkin spice latte, we would get them for other people and try to pass the kindness forward.\" O'Neill had no clue how many people this random act of kindness would affect. Two days after Alyssa's funeral, the O'Neills went to a Starbucks in Erie, Pennsylvania, where they live, and purchased lattes for 40 strangers. O'Neill asked the manager to write the hashtag #AJO with a purple marker on each cup. According to O'Neill, the manager and employees, overwhelmed with the gesture, donated 50 drinks on top of the 40. \"It just kind of exploded at that point. We had somewhat of a following, but nothing like this,\" he said. Now the movement to raise awareness about epilepsy has gone beyond lattes. \"It was just random acts of kindness. People have been paying others' Christmas layaways and buying meals,\" O'Neill said. The Facebook memorial page AJO Forever in our Hearts has more than 28,000 likes. O'Neill said his daughter's initials have nearly turned into a verb. \"People are saying, 'I got AJOed this morning,' 'Have you AJOed today?'\" From Erie to Sri Lanka, the O'Neills have been receiving photos showing #AJO. The family knew of Alyssa's seizure disorder before the fatal episode. Alyssa was a high school cheerleader who hoped to become a nurse and help others with epilepsy. She was a first-semester student at Penn State Behrend. The O'Neills started the AJO Forever Fund to assist families of children with epilepsy and to bolster a scholarship fund for local cheerleaders looking to go into nursing.",

Allan Baldwin, of Lockerbie in Scotland said that from 2008 until 2013 he had extreme difficulty in walking and claimed the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance. Today at Preston Crown Court he was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and order to perform 200 hours of unpaid work.

Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

        "document": "Father-of-five: Brian Falcus, 38, received £19,000 in disability handouts while working as an instructor sergeant for army cadets . A benefits cheat avoided jail despite being given £19,000 in disability handouts while working as an instructor sergeant for army cadets. Father-of-five Brian Falcus, 38, of North Shields, Tyne and Wear, was given government help after claiming he had restricted mobility and needed help with personal care. But he was involved in parades two nights per week, educational weekends and annual camps and courses with young recruits at the army cadet corps. Prosecutor Graeme O’Sullivan told Newcastle Crown Court that Falcus was paid disability living allowance from 2004 and employment support allowance from 2009. He added: ‘Evidence came to light that in August 2010 Mr Falcus had joined the army cadet corps as an instructor sergeant. He had been passed fit to do so on August 8, 2010.’ Mr O’Sullivan said the basis for Falcus’s award for benefits was ‘restricted mobility and help with personal care’. He added: ‘The prosecution case is, from 2010, his physical capability must have improved for him to be sufficiently fit.’ Mr O’Sullivan said the benefits would normally be given to wheelchair users, people with disabilities making it difficult for them to get around and those with illnesses that restrict their mobility. Falcus pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances. Mr O’Sullivan added: ‘He accepts during the period he ought to have notified the department of an improvement in his circumstances.’ The court heard the army fitness test which allowed Falcus to be sergeant, a voluntary post with just expenses paid, would not have been as rigorous as those taken by soldiers who would be deployed on the front line. Mr O’Sullivan said: ‘His work involved parading two nights per week, educational weekends, annual camp and various courses.’ Judge John Milford sentenced Falcus to 14 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with a three-month curfew from 8pm to 7am. The judge told him: ‘You have pleaded guilty to benefit fraud which has cost the British taxpayer £19,000. Sentencing: Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard Falcus, of North Shields, Tyne and Wear, was paid disability living allowance from 2004 and employment support allowance from 2009 . ‘You were receiving two allowances, the most significant of which was disability living allowance and the other employment support allowance on the basis you were suffering from a significant disability, namely restricted mobility. ‘The fact of the matter is, for three years over the period of this fraudulent claim, you were fit enough to be a sergeant instructor in the cadets and had you informed the department, as you should have done of that, no doubt the allowances would not have been paid.’ Nicholas Lane, defending, said Falcus is the father of five children, two of whom have extra needs. Mr Lane said Falcus got involved with the cadets when his doctor advised him to be more active. He added: ‘We are not talking about a man assessed as fit to take up a role on the front line. This is a gentleman who, on the army cadet force health guidelines, is assessed as being able to take part in supervision and other activities for boys and girls.’",

        "document": "New York (CNN) -- From the loudspeakers of New York police patrol cars and search vehicles, Avonte Oquendo's mother calls for him. She urges the 14-year-old autistic boy to walk toward the flashing blue and white lights of the emergency vehicles that have been combing the streets for him. The recording is part of the New York Police Department's stepped up search efforts to find Avonte, who was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4, Keith Brooks, director of operations for CityWide Disaster Services, said Thursday. \"Avonte, this is your mother. You are safe. Walk toward the lights,\" the message repeats. The hope is the teen, who is unable to communicate verbally, will hear the sound of his mother's voice and approach the emergency vehicles. The reward for the safe return of Avonte grew this week to $77,500, as divers joined an ever growing number of police and rescue officers from several states who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week. What is autism? Avonte's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, told CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live\" that she believes her son is still alive and that someone is probably holding him. \"My message to my son is that I love him and we're going to find him. You'll come home to your family. And for anyone who has him, please be kind and to let him go,\" she said Thursday night. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said he is not holding the school safety officer who was on duty when the teen ran out of the Queens high school responsible for the boy's disappearance. When Avonte approached the front door of his school the day he disappeared, the safety agent told him to go back upstairs, Kelly said at a news conference on Wednesday. Surveillance video then showed Avonte turning and going down another hallway, and exiting the building from a side door, he said. Surveillance video provided by the police department shows that no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. \"Even though he's 14, it shouldn't matter. No one should be, you know, allowed to run around the hallways in school. And that security guard should have questioned him,\" Fontaine said. Growing up autistic . Police said Avonte was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Missing-persons posters are being handed out, and the search has expanded to areas outside New York City, Kelly said. The teenager is fascinated by trains, his family has said. Searches of train stations, tracks and tunnels are being conducted at the start of every shift by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, Kelly said, adding that 50 NYPD officers and a task force of detectives are working the case. Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system this past weekend as workers combed the underground network. All 468 New York City subway stations have been searched, and aviation, harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically, the NYPD said. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, said it took school officials at least 45 minutes to call police after Avonte left. \"I don't understand how this happens to a special needs child unless there is something in there that failed the family,\" he told \"Piers Morgan Live\" on Thursday. Last week, Perecman said he was looking into how the child was able to leave school grounds unsupervised. \"Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred,\" he said. The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with police. The school is not commenting. The Oquendo family filed a \"notice of claim\" on Wednesday, said Perecman, marking the first step of a lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information about the claim.

        "document": "By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 13:35 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:32 EST, 23 October 2013 . The number of children diagnosed with special education needs has plummeted by 70,000 after the government announced a crackdown. In 2011-12, 1.62 million pupils were labelled as having some form of learning difficulty, behavioural problem or speech impediment. This fell last year to 1.55 million - a difference of almost five per cent in just 12 months. In 2011-12, 1.62 million pupils were labelled as having some form of learning difficulty (file picture) SEN diagnoses have been viewed with some suspicion as they can be used to claim extra funds and are taken into account when assessing exam results - potentially improving a school's place in league tables. Three years ago a damning Ofsted report estimated 450,000 children had been classed as SEN to hide poor teaching. The Coalition subsequently announced it was tackling the problem by introducing tougher screening measures. Figures from the Department for Education show a quarter of boys (943,430) officially have a problem that affects academic performance - almost double the 511,570 girls. Girls were more likely to have hearing impairments and moderate learning difficulties, while boys had a greater chance of autism or behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. The rate among children receiving free school meals - a key indicator of poverty - was 30.1 per cent compared to 14.1 per cent among those from more affluent homes. Black children were the most likely to be diagnosed with special needs. The lowest rates were among Chinese and Indian families. Pupils with SEN are 11 times more likely to be permanently excluded and five times more likely to be suspended on one or more occasions. Those with a statement of special educational needs - which can release extra money, staff time and equipment - are eight times more likely to be expelled and six times more likely to be suspended at least once. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said schools were still 'miles away from a real figure for SEN'. He added: 'Schools have a vested interest in identifying children as having SEN as it attracts extra funding and tends to disguise failures in teaching. 'The tragedy for children with genuine need is that resources are being spread very thinly as a result.'",

        "document": "Lauren Graham (pictured) was left with a view of a metal gate for the entirety of the Ed Sheeran concert . A wheelchair-bound Ed Sheeran fan was left in tears during his concert after her view was obstructed by a metal gate and she was told to stand up when she complained about it to staff. Lauren Graham splashed out £77 on two tickets to watch her favourite singer perform at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena (NIA) on October 18. The disabled 24-year-old was left devastated after the vantage point she was given completely obstructed her view of the stage and she was stunned when told she should stand up when she complained to security staff. Instead of receiving help, she was forced to stare at large blue metal railings in tears for the duration of the one-and-a-half-hour gig. Yesterday Ms Graham, from Solihull, West Midlands, accused NIA of discrimination and said she was disgusted by the way they treated her. She fumed: 'Ed Sheeran's other two shows were sold out so we were very lucky to get tickets. I couldn't wait for it as he is one of my favourite singers. 'But when I got there I realised I couldn't see the stage. The gate obstructed the entire view and I do not understand how that is acceptable for the disabled bay. 'The door supervisor told my sister Ellie to just move me back and for me to stand up. I couldn't believe my ears. 'I found this incredibly rude and disrespectful considering that I can't stand up. He said the only other option was to move to the back of the arena. 'They just wanted to shove me out of the way where you barely see anyway. 'When my sister disagreed he dismissed her and stressed it was the only solution and could not offer any further help. 'I paid the same as able-bodied people but my view was compromised due to the poor layout and I received no help to rectify the situation. 'I felt discriminated against and I was left in tears for most of the evening. It completely ruined my night.' Ms Graham has Friedreich's Ataxia, a progressive neurological illness which effects her balance and prevents her from standing for long periods. When she complained about the view (pictured), the wheelchair-bound fan was told to move and stand up . She was diagnosed with the condition when she was nine-years-old but has been in a wheelchair since February. She emailed to complain about her treatment at the concert which she attended with her sister and carer Ellie, 21, and her friend Lizzie Mcinnerney, 21. But was outraged with the response she received last Tuesday  from the NIA - which is one of the biggest entertainment venues in Europe. Ms Graham, who works at Birmingham Airport on the check-in desk, said: 'They basically told me it was all our own fault. 'The door supervisor we named had a very different recollection of how he had helped us that evening. 'He said my sister shook his hand and said 'thank you' for being helpful, but that never happened. I know my sister, and she definitely didn't do that. 'They said the railings had been there for my own safety, what did they think I was going to do, roll off down the stairs in my wheelchair? 'They then emailed back a couple of weeks after saying maybe the staff member was having an \"off-day\", which I thought was a bit of a understatement but unprofessional to say anyway. Ms Graham had paid £77 for two tickets to the Ed Sheeran concert to cover entry for herself and a carer, and a friend. Pictured is Sheeran performing at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Glasgow three nights ago . The Ed Sheeran concert was held at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham (pictured) on October 18 . 'I've been to lots of concerts at other venues and have never had any problems like at the NIA. 'I won't be going back there, they have treated me appallingly.' Guy Dunstan, general manager of NEC Group which runs the NIA, said: 'Our customers' enjoyment is of the utmost importance and it is always disappointing to hear a visitor isn't satisfied with their experience. 'The barriers are essential for the safety of our visitors. 'Full consultations were held with the relevant groups and an independent assessor who represented disabled people whereby the use of these barriers was agreed as they are fully compliant in the disabled seating area. 'We pride ourselves on our customer service and our staff did their utmost to offer a solution as due to the popularity of the event alternative seating was not possible on this occasion. 'We are continually looking to improve our facilities to ensure complete customer satisfaction and take on board all feedback so this is something we are looking into.'",

        "document": "(CNN) -- These days, some of the best running trails can be found in the world's busiest places. Which is great news for time-crunched business travelers who want to keep up with their fitness routines while seeing a bit of the city they're visiting. Here are some of the world's best urban running trails that allow you to experience both nature and architecture. The High Line (New York) This much-hyped 2.3-kilometer-long linear park sits on a disused section of the New York Central Railroad and connects Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District with 34th Street. \"I love running the High Line for many reasons,\" says Katie Shea, a member of the New York Road Runners. \"It's an amazing green space high above street level, so you're not only getting the chance to be out in nature, but you're taking in views of the Hudson River and the Empire State Building, along with other skyscrapers. \"There are several art installations, so it's like running through an outdoor museum.\" Starting point: Gansevoort Street . Riverside (Shanghai) The seven-kilometer Xuhui Riverside is a shiny strip of tarmac alongside the Huangpu River that has a designated lane for runners. The route starts from the Xuhui Riverside Public Open Space, near the Chuanchang Lu metro station, and finishes near Expo Zone C. Highlights include the luxurious turreted apartment blocks near Huangpu and, on the final stretch, views of the arched Lupu Bridge. Starting point: Xuhui Riverside Public Open Space, Longteng Avenue . Mont-Royal (Montreal) Montreal's 200-hectare Mont-Royal park is crisscrossed with a network of running trails. The Golden Square Mile area is the greenest section. More advanced runners head to Avenue des Pins and follow the signs for Belvedere and Chalet. This trail leads up the mountain, but the views from the top -- Montreal's highest point -- make the effort worthwhile. \"Mont-Royal is centrally located, making it easily accessible,\" says Paul Gantous, president of the Boreal Runners Club. \"The unpaved roads are easy on the joints, although the slope at times can be challenging when you're making your way up to the top of Mont-Royal.\" Starting point: 1260 Remembrance Road . Hong Kong Trail (Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Trail has a total length of 50 kilometers but can be easily broken down into shorter stretches. \"Starting from the Peak, the first half is a gradual descent through dense tropical woodland, crossing occasional streams and offering brief glimpses of the city below,\" explains Peter Hopper, a member of Hong Kong's Italia Running Club. \"The second half includes steep exposed climbs over some of the island's highest peaks, with 360-degree views. The finish in Big Wave Bay is the perfect place to relax.\" Those looking for something light can start with the easygoing Section #1 -- a seven-kilometer stretch that begins at the Peak and finishes at the Pokfulam Reservoir. Starting point: Victoria Peak . Trinity Skyline Trail (Dallas) With stunning views over downtown Dallas, the 7.4-kilometer Trinity Skyline Trail starts at the Joppa Preserve's Lemmon Lake in the city's outskirts and finishes at the Trinity River Audubon Center downtown. \"What makes this such a great trail is that it's so conveniently located near the hustle of the downtown area, yet it still gives you that nature feel,\" says Alex Delacruz from the Dallas Running Club. \"The beauty of the trail makes you forget that you're in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the United States, until you pause at the end of your run and see the sunset reflecting off the classic Dallas skyline.\" Starting point: Great Trinity Forest Way, Joppa Preserve . Tennessee Riverwalk (Chattanooga, Tennessee) The 20-kilometer Tennessee Riverwalk is a linear park that starts at Ross's Landing in Chattanooga and finishes in the city center. \"I like that I can run 10 kilometers in one direction, then turn around and run 10 back, and the scenery changes constantly,\" says Courtney Bird, founder of Run Chattanooga. \"Not just when I change locations along the Riverwalk, but throughout the day as the sun comes out and it warms up. \"There's really nothing like watching the sunrise over the Hunter Museum or watching the city wake up from the Walnut Street Bridge viewpoint.\" Starting point: Riverfront Parkway . New Orleans jogging tour (New Orleans) Running can be a great way to discover a city but if you don't want to go it alone, New Orleans offers organized running tours. Runs depart from the Old U.S. Mint building in the French Quarter and finish near the Garden District along the St. Charles Avenue streetcar tracks. The 90-minute tours start at 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., Monday through Saturday, and the route is 10 kilometers. There are several rest stops at some of the city's more famous buildings, such as the Old Ursuline Convent and the National WWII Museum. Neworleansjoggingtours.com has more information. Starting point: 400 Esplanade Ave. The Bay Run (Sydney) \"Sydney is a place with hundreds of running trails, from runs along the city's harbor to longer challenging bush trails in the chains of bush land that dots Sydney suburbs and outskirts,\" says Joe Degabriele, president of the Sydney Striders Running Club. Among these is the Bay Run, a trail in Sydney's western suburbs that loops around the lovely Iron Cove. In the past year it's been widened to allow more room for both cyclists and runners. \"It's a beautiful setting with flat separated footpaths over a seven-kilometer circuit,\" says Degabriele. Starting point: King George Park . Thames Path (London) The 289-kilometer Thames Path stretches from the Thames Flood Barrier at Woolwich in South East London to Kemble in Gloucestershire, but unless you're a superhuman, running the entire length in one go isn't really an option. We recommend tackling the 13-kilometer section winding from Richmond, on the outskirts of London, to Hammersmith in the city center. You can expect stunning views of the city, lots of wildlife and plenty of opportunities for an energy-boosting ice cream cone. Starting point: Richmond Riverside, Richmond . Yoyogi Park (Tokyo) Though temporarily closed, this 133-acre park, one of Tokyo's biggest, is usually open 24 hours a day in the heart of the city, making it a popular destination for post-work runs. Running paths inside the park are conveniently covered with distance markers so you can gauge your progress. The park is also popular with blind runners, thanks to volunteers who lead visually impaired runners. The trail provides a pleasant, compact circuit and the only off-limits area is the park's Meiji Shrine. If you can't wait til you get back to the hotel there are showers at the nearby Wired Cafe Fit outside the park's stadium. Starting point: 2-1 Yoyogi Kamizonocho, Shibuya. Meijijingumae and Harajuku are the nearest stations to the park. Check here for details about its reopening. Tamara Hinson is a freelance travel writer based in the UK.",

        "document": "By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 08:58 EST, 7 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:04 EST, 7 January 2014 . The policeman blinded by Raoul Moat threatened to hang himself during a video call while his wife was watching, an inquest heard today. But the police family liaison officer who was told about his 'bizarre' threat said she did not believe PC David Rathband would go through with it. DC Alison Brown, who wept as she gave evidence, told the coroner's court how she had been concerned about the wounded policeman in the weeks before he was found dead. The 44-year-old had been left blind and fighting for his life after gunman Raoul Moat shot him twice while he was on the run in July 2010. Threat: PC David Rathband said he would kill himself on FaceTime in front of his wife Kath an inquest heard . He went on to win national praise for . the way he tackled his new disability, creating the Blue Lamp Foundation . to help emergency workers injured at work. But . in February 2012 he was found hanged at the three-storey townhouse in . Blyth, Northumberland, which he had moved into following a domestic . incident with his wife. Giving evidence DC Brown, who worked with the Rathband family after he was shot, said he made the threat to kill himself to his estranged wife Kath. The liaison officer, who said her professional relationship with the family eventually developed into a personal one, said she never thought he would actually kill himself. Mr Rathband threatened to kill himself while on FaceTime - which is Apple's video calling facility, the inquest in Moot Hall, Newcastle, heard. Testimony: DC Alison Brown told the court about PC Rathband's 'bizarre' threat to take his own life . 'She (Kath) said he was thinking of hanging himself and would put his phone onto FaceTime so she could see him doing it,' she said. 'I thought it was such a bizarre thing to say. Saying you're going to hang yourself and do it on FaceTime is bizarre. 'David had never said to me personally . that he had any suicidal thoughts. I knew there was these Twitter posts . and what he said to Kath but he never said anything to me. 'For someone to say that, I just thought it was an awful thing to say. 'I was concerned for his well-being and his mental state but I did not think he would kill himself.' DC Brown contacted PC Rathband while he was in Australia staying with his brother because she was concerned about him. She became worried about some 'random' Tweets the officer sent. DC . Brown said: 'I sent an email to Inspector John Heckles saying I was . concerned about David and he rang me. He planned to pick David up from . the airport when he returned. 'The random tweets were contradictory to the happy family photos that were being posted on Facebook by David’s brother.' While . David was in Australia DC Brown spoke to a friend of David’s, Tony . Horn, and told him something needed to be done to help David but . 'whether he would accept it would be another matter'. Couple: David Rathband with wife Kath Rathband at a charity event in October 2010, before they broke up. The inquest heard he had an affair . Relationship: PC Rathband and 7/7 bombing survivor Lisa French met on Twitter and had an affair, which led to the break-up of his 20-year marriage, the inquest has heard . On the day of David’s death DC Brown was on duty at the Etal Lane police station in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle. At . around 6.25pm she received a personal message on Facebook from Debbie . Essery, David’s sister, expressing concern after Kath Rathband told her . about David’s state. In the message Mrs Essery told DC Brown that David was 'slowly killing himself.' DC Brown rang Kath Rathband who told her she had found David in his pajamas, looking 'awful'. DC . Brown said: 'At this point I was not concerned for his immediate . safety but I was concerned about his well being and mental state. I . didn’t think that David would hang himself. 'The . fact David did not answer his telephone did not concern me as this had . been typical of his behaviour since moving back to Blyth.' Estranged: Kath Rathband, left, the estranged wife of David Rathband and Lisa French, right, who the officer apparently had an affair with . DCI Nicola Musgrove was informed about the situation in a phone call from CD Brown at 8.04pm, but did not dispatch an officer to David's address until 8.24pm. DCI Musgrove told the court she was 'extremely concerned' for David's welfare despite waiting nearly half an hour to send a police officer to his address. She said she discussed with Superintendent James Napier who would be best to send to David's address to check on his welfare. She said: 'There was a need to check the information first rather than have that information third hand.  Action wasn't put on hold, there was gathering of information. Police activity was going on. 'He had to check that he was ok. We couldn't ignore it but we had to balance it against other information about threats he made in the past. We couldn't guess what the outcome was going to be at that time.' Superintendent James Napier said: 'It was reported by an off duty police officer and friend of the family - that negated the immediacy. Gunman: Raoul Moat shot PC David Rathband while on the run in July 2010 . 'For me there was no immediacy around this situation. This is because Mrs Rathband did not know if these threats were real and the information was incomplete. 'I wanted a swift response, not an immediate response. I wasn't prepared to wait an hour as I knew there would be travelling time and difficulties getting to his house but I wasn't prepared to send an immediate response. 'I wanted more information about what was getting reported and it was getting reported to me that the police were not to be involved. As it was we were involved.' Inspector David Guthrie was sent to David Rathband's house and met with Sgt Patterson and David's welfare officer John Heckles. They gained access at 9.25pm. As he entered the property he heard music playing before seeing 'material hanging down with a dark shape'. Inspector Guthrie said: 'There was a slight delay as I had to call for the enforcer team. I can confirm we forced entry at 9.25pm. 'When we gained entry the three of us identified ourselves and then went upstairs to the first floor. 'I heard music but I was not sure where it was coming from. Then I saw material hanging down with a dark shape. Inspector Heckles ran forward to support his body and I cut the ligature. 'The two paramedics joined us to carry out CPR. Inspector Heckles received a call on his mobile telephone, it was Mrs Rathband that was calling and he left the address. I saw no sign if breathing from David. He appeared lifeless.' For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org .",

        "document": "Mr Punter wanted to claim disability benefits based on the injury to his left leg - but the DWP thought he wanted to claim for an earlier injury to his right foot . A man who had his leg amputated was falsely accused of fiddling disability benefit after officials read a file about the other, healthy limb. Robert Punter was hauled before a court by benefits officials who told him he was not disabled enough to claim the allowance even though his leg was due to be amputated. The mix up occurred because the 63-year-old former trucker, whose left leg was shattered in a boyhood shotgun accident, also suffered a serious toe injury in his right foot. He was prosecuted when officials found a letter in his medical file showing he had made a full recovery from that operation and accused him of lying about his condition. He is angry that he has been treated as a criminal, despite battling to overcome his disability and work for 47 years, often in excruciating pain. Robert, of Newton Abbot, Devon, spent months waiting for his case to be heard at Exeter Crown Court before it was thrown out in less than five minutes. He denied falsely claiming disability living allowance and Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, recorded not guilty verdicts after Miss Emily Pitts offered no evidence on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions. The case was dropped after defence solicitor Miss Ann Bellchambers obtained a statement from Torbay Hospital consultant Patrick Loxdale, confirming that Mr Punter had always suffered from a disability which entitled him to benefit. After the case Mr Punter explained that the case arose from a simple misunderstanding. His claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg, which had eventually led to the amputation. The Department of Work and Pensions . prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to . the injury to his right foot, which had been treated successfully and . healed. He said: . 'This whole business has been a nightmare. I have been taken to court . and accused of swinging the lead when the truth was the opposite. The DWP prosecuted him on the basis that he had claimed benefits in relation to the injury to his right foot, which had been treated successfully and healed . 'I suffered a very serious injury to my left leg in a shotgun accident when I was 12. At one stage it was touch and go whether I would survive. 'I never used it as an excuse not to work. I started in the old Leathercraft factory in Newton Abbot when I was 15 and then drove dumpers and tippers on building sites until I passed my HGV and became a lorry driver. 'I did that for 40 years until I suffered arthritis in my right foot which led eventually to me having an operation to fuse my toe. 'It was while I was in hospital I met someone from the Citizen’s Advice Bureau who told me I was entitled to disability allowance even though I was planning to go back to work. 'After I was called in for interview and told I would be prosecuted my wife took photos of my left leg and sent them to the DWP but it made no difference. 'At the same time as this case was going through the system I was in a lot of pain from the left leg and went back to hospital where Mr Loxdale told me I had degenerative bone disease and would need an amputation. 'It took months to persuade them that I . am disabled but in the end they only restored my benefit after my left . leg was amputated above the knee.' The . consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital who wrote to Exeter . Crown Court about Robert Punter said the prosecution was 'barking mad'. Mr Punter's claim for disability benefits was based on the long standing injury to his left leg, which had eventually led to the amputation . The consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Torbay Hospital who amputated Mr Punter's leg said the prosecution was 'barking mad' Patrick Loxdale, who amputated the Mr Punter's lower left leg earlier this year, wrote a letter about his medical history to his solicitor. In it he said: 'Robert Punter suffered a devastating injury to his left leg at the age of 12 and was lucky not to lose his leg. 'When I first me I was amazed to hear that he'd held a job down as a tipper driver for many years up until the age of 63, with plans to continue working until retirement age of 65. 'It was quite clear to me that he was a highly stoical individual who had minimised very significant orthopaedic problems in his left leg. '...Clearly I don't have details of the prosecution case against Robert Punter but I can say without any shadow of doubt that this man coped with a very severe left leg injury from the age of 12 to 63, holding down a physicaly demanding job and , in my view, tolerating a great deal of pain and incapacity in the process. 'However, as someone who generally takes a relatively robust attitude to some patients' desires to claim benefits, I find the fact that Robert Punter is being pursued completely bizarre to the point of being barking mad. 'This, in my opinion, is a highly genuine man with an extremely significant orthopaedic problem who is actually an example of somebody who's got on with their life and held down a job under extremely difficult circumstances.' A Department of Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases.'In this case the defendant's health deteriorated as the case was being progressed. 'In light of his deteriorating health it was not in the public interest for this case to continue.' She said she could not comment on the consultant's remarks and said it was a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision to review the case in court and offer no evidence. She added: 'Our fraud investigators present the best evidence possible, however, ultimately it's for the CPS to decide whether a prosecution goes ahead for benefit fraud. 'If an overpayment is suspected then we will seek to recover that as a civil matter.'",

        "document": "By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 03:41 EST, 21 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:47 EST, 21 June 2012 . A mother has told how she believed her child was the Anti-Christ as she endured traumatic hallucinations after giving birth to her son. Tracy Vicker seemed like the perfect mother - breastfeeding her baby son, keeping the house clean and baking cakes, but she was going through a secret trauma. She told Cheltenham Science Festival she had become convinced her baby had the face of the Devil. A mother's trauma: Tracey Vicker said she started suffering terrible hallucinations as soon as she had given birth (file picture) 'I had my son in 2007. Immediately after his traumatic birth, I knew something was wrong,' she said. 'I had it in my head that he had died during childbirth. By the time I got home, I was completely loopy. I was convinced I'd given birth to the Anti-Christ and that was my role. 'Every time I looked at him, I saw the face of the devil. I saw dancing little devils in the room. When I breastfed, I was afraid he would eat off my chest. 'On the outside I seemed to be Super Mum but on the inside everything was crumbling apart. 'I told my husband I was going to open a goat farm in a warehouse in the middle of Glasgow and feed milk to asylum seekers. I couldn't understand why he didn't think it was a good idea. 'My husband thought I was losing it and the midwives thought I was doing really well until they started asking all the questions and realised things weren't right.' Tracy, who now lives near Bridgend, South Wales, said she was diagnosed with post-natal depression - but she was actually suffering from post-partum psychosis, which is experienced by an estimated 1 in 1,000 new mothers in the UK every year. She added: 'I had to go and be part of a depressed people group but I was on a complete high and they were all sitting around crying. It was the wrong treatment for me.' Tracy didn't get any medication at all and it took nine months for the psychosis to tail off. She said she was frightened about having another child but when she was pregnant and had a daughter in 2009 she had support from a psychiatric nurse. 'For the first couple of hours after the birth I felt great but it was when I got home things started to go wonky again,' she said. Trauma: Tracy was suffering from post-partum psychosis but was incorrectly diagnosed (picture posed by models) 'This time I had dripping dead torsos living at the bottom of the garden. Part of their bodies would come whizzing at the windows of the house. I told my husband and psychiatric nurse.' Tracy declined medication because she preferred to breastfeed her daughter, and because the mother and baby unit was full, her husband had to give up his job to help with round-the-clock care for her at home. She said she was not having any more children because she doesn't want to go through the hallucinations again. Tracy, a member of Action on Post-Partum Psychosis, which has a website providing information and support, believes that post-partum psychosis, should be discussed with expectant mothers along with post-natal depression, so that they are informed and can seek help if it happens to them. 'I had no idea about it. I'd never heard of it before. It should definitely be discussed to raise awareness among women - not to frighten them. 'If my husband had known about it, he might have picked up on my illness quicker. At the time, he just thought he was losing his wife.' Clare Dolman, chair of Bi-Polar UK, who has also suffered post-partum psychosis, said: 'It's such a tragedy. Loads of midwives actually don't even know what post-partum psychosis is. 'It was illustrated very well for me by a woman who had a very bad episode out of the blue. 'In one of her ante-natal classes she had seen one leaflet which talked about post-natal depression and three lines about post-partum psychosis. 'When she was manic, she thought she might have what was in the leaflet and they got the doctors in to see her. 'When you are feeling really great in pregnancy, you are not going to think you're going to get it, but if you just hear about it - what it is - it might trigger something if you notice a relative or friend behaving bizarrely after birth.' Dr Ian Jones, a perinatal psychologist at Cardiff MRC Centre for Neurosciences and Genomics, said the 'airbrushed image of perfection' of new mothers was not the experience for many women. There was a long history of a link between psychiatric illness and childbirth. 'Baby blues' affect half or more of new mothers, while post-natal depression affects affects up to fifteen percent and puerperal or post-partum psychosis is suffered by 1 in 1,000 which means that thousands of mothers are affected every year. 'It's a severe psychosis with mixed mood symptoms. It's a psychiatric emergency. Ideally, the mother and baby need to be taken to a specialist mother and baby unit,' Dr Jones said. Research in Cardiff had shown that the big shifts in hormone levels during the first three or four days after birth, plus the effect of sleep disruption, could trigger psychiatric illness - particularly in bi-polar women. There was evidence that genetic factors could be involved - meaning that the risk could run in families.",

        "document": "A blind fashion designer who lost his sight in a horrific attack as a teenager has told how he overcame his nightmarish childhood to gain critical acclaim on the Parish fashion scene. Mason Ewing has been blind for half his life following savage abuse from relatives, but was determined to realise his dream of working at the height of the fashion world. Now, despite only being able to see vague shapes and colours, the 30-year-old has become an accomplished designer in Paris - and has even revealed plans to conquer Hollywood. Impressive: Mason Ewing has become a fashion designer despite being blind . Cameroon-born Mason creates elaborate dresses by describing his detailed designs to a team of artists, while his heightened sense of touch allows him to feel his creations and differentiate between materials. According to the Los Angeles Times, he has found that his blindness enhances his ability to distinguish between the textures of silks, lace, linen and cotton. And since overcoming his horrific childhood, Mason has launched his own t-shirt line and even completed his first fashion show in the French capital in 2006. Mason became inspired by fashion aged just four, after watching Naomi Campbell and other supermodels on the catwalk as a young boy. However, after his mother was murdered when he was a child, Mason was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Paris aged six, and he was subjected to vicious beatings. The budding fashion designer was abused throughout his childhood, culminating in an attack where he was punched and kicked, causing a seizure which left him in hospital. Dream: Mason's next aspiration is to make it in the world of Hollywood . When he woke up, Mason found he had lost his sight, and he was placed in a series of foster homes by French authorities. Undetered though, Mason went on to study physical therapy at college, before deciding in 2001 he wanted to pursue his dream of fashion design. Other budding designers had been skeptical of his ability to succeed in the highly-competitive fashion world, but Mason was backed by a French organization for the handicapped, Agefiph, who financed his first show in 2006, according to reports. Mason has since created a line of t-shirts featuring a multi-ethnic cartoon character, Baby Madison. His t-shirts feature raised braille so that he can tell what colour the garment is and what image is printed on it. And after launching his own t-shirt range, Mason plans to now create his own televised teen drama. Mary E. Fry, a producer and casting director for independent films who is helping Mason realise his dream of creating a television series, told the LA Times: 'I grew up in an era of Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder and I know what they've accomplished. 'He'll have people at his side that are his eyes and ears. His biggest challenge is getting investors in line.'",

Ellie Simmonds missed out on an historic golden hat-trick, coming second in the 100m freestyle . As the poster girl for the Paralympics, the hopes of Britain were once again heaped on her small shoulders. But yesterday – on the final full day of competition – swimmer Ellie Simmonds just missed out on an historic golden hat-trick after she was beaten into second place by long-time rival Victoria Arlen in the 100m freestyle. It was a fitting climax for the most successful Paralympics ever – the struggle for supremacy between the 17-year-olds has ignited the public's interest in disabled sport. Arlen took an early lead in . yesterday's race before storming down the final length to win in a . world-record time. Afterwards the great rivals embraced over the lane . ropes. Simmonds said: 'I . gave it everything on the last 50m but I just didn't have anything left. I am really happy – I would have loved to get the gold, but you can't . have everything.' Arlen . said: 'I don't even know how to react, I was in shock. When you look up . at the results, there is no feeling to describe it.' The drama of their rivalry has spanned the 11-day duration of the Paralympics. Two days before the Opening Ceremony, . Arlen was left distraught after being kicked out of the Games for not . being impaired enough by her disability. However, she was reinstated on . appeal just in time to allow her to do battle with Simmonds for the . first time in the 400m freestyle last Saturday. Then, the British heroine seized the lead in the final few metres to win the 'race of the Games', leaving the feisty American 'growling with anger'. But Arlen yesterday extracted sweet revenge by defeating Simmonds to take gold in the 100m freestyle. Ever since Simmonds's first golden performance, television figures for the Paralympics have gone through the roof. Her victory last Saturday was watched by 2.9 million viewers. Five days later 5.5 million saw track star David Weir take home his 800m title, and 6.7 million tuned in to see Jonnie Peacock defeat 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius in the 100m. There have also been sellout crowds. A record 2.7million people attended the Games, surpassing attendances at the Beijing Paralympics by 900,000. The Games have raised £45 million as corporate sponsors have rushed to take advantage of the enormous exposure the Paralympics has provided. Scroll down for video . Ellie Simmonds holds her silver medal as she stands on the podium next to long-term rival Victoria Arlen of the U.S. British success has also helped. As of yesterday, ParalympicGB was ranked third in the medals table with 115 in total, including 32 golds, surpassing the team's haul from Beijing four years ago. Yesterday's medallists included  cyclist David Stone, who successfully defended his title in the road race at Brands Hatch.

The 31-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, took part in the 2000 Paralympics before giving up the sport for several years to travel to India. He resumed his career in time to win two gold medals in 2008. David Smith won silver in the boccia and there was a bronze for Harriet Lee in the 100m breaststroke. Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the British Paralympic Association, said the Paralympics must 'build on the momentum' the London Games has created. He added: 'I defy anyone to say that some of the remarkable victories we have seen at these Games have not been among some of the greatest moments in British sport.' David Smith, pictured, won silver in the boccia and there was a bronze for Harriet Lee in the 100m breaststroke . Nobody has quite captured the public's affection as much as the 4ft 1in Simmonds, from Walsall, who also won the 200m individual medley. Ellie, who has a form of short-limbed dwarfism, was already the subject of adulation after winning two golds in Beijing as an irrepressible 13-year-old but the courage of her performances at these Games took it to a different level. Her father Steve Simmonds said last night: 'She delivers on the right stage and there's no bigger stage than this. She's done herself, us and her country proud. 'Just because she didn't win tonight doesn't mean she hasn't given every ounce of what she's got.' He added his daughter sent him a text message about her experience at the Games. He said: 'The last thing she said was, “I don't want it to end.” She loves it, she loves the whole atmosphere, she loves being in there, she loves being with the team, she loves being in the village.' Simmonds has helped changed attitudes towards disability, he added. 'People like Oscar Pistorius, David Weir and Ellie have created a culture with the Paralympics,' he said. 'People come to watch high performance, honed, trained athletes perform to the best of their ability. Years ago they came to the freak show. It's what Ellie's been hammering away at for four years. It's all about getting sport out there, getting disability sport more known, accepted and understood. 'She's aware that people look at her and they see a star athlete. She thinks it's important that people understand that she's just her. She just happens to be good at something that people look up to and have respect for.' Crying wolf: Weir fan dresses up as a weirwolf in tribute to the wheelchair athlete . All eyes will be on David Weir today as he aims to clinch his fourth gold medal of the Games. 'The Weirwolf' has already set the Olympic Stadium alight with three outstanding performances in the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m wheelchair track events. Now the streets of London are expected to ring out with his trademark battle-cry 'howl' as he takes part in the marathon. Weir's team-mates developed the 'Weirwolf' call after adapting it from the 1978 rock song Werewolves Of London, by Warren Zevon. 'It's pretty good,' said Weir, 33, who  was born with a severed spinal cord which left him unable to use his legs. And Weir's exploits have certainly endeared him to fans. Sonny Carter, 12, from Hemel Hempstead, said: 'He makes me proud to be British.' A paralympian who was forced to compete on one leg will return home with two, thanks to the Games' support team. Haitian Josue Cajuste was born without half his left leg and could not afford a £5,000 prosthesis. The 2010 Haiti earthquake also meant he had to train for the shot put and javelin among rubble. Haiti's Josue Cajuste competes in the men's javelin F42 final during the London 2012 Paralympic Games . The 29-year-old came last in the shot because he was unable to compete with other athletes who had prosthetics. Afterwards, Josue's coach pleaded for help from German prosthetic company Ottobock, which offers free services to Paralympians. Technicians were so moved by his story they built him his first ever replacement leg. With his new limb allowing him to take a run-up, Josue threw a Haitian record of 32m in Friday's javelin heats and finished 11th. 'The cheer of the crowd when I was on the runway was incredible,' he said. 'I shall never forget it.' VIDEO: Ellie Simmonds looks back on London 2012 .",

        "document": "By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The story of Edward De Lacy Evans read like every other man's in the 19th century - he was a labourer, husband and father. But underneath the suit and tie was a body of a woman named Ellen Tremayne - also known as Ellen Tremaye - who could have been Australia's first transgender person. Mr De Lacy Evans arrived on Australian shores from Ireland in June 1856 as an assisted immigrant on-board the Ocean Monarch. It is speculated he was born between 1829 to 1841 due to a discrepancy in shipping lists, and birth, marriage and death certificates. Edward De Lacy Evans who could be Australia's first transgender person as a woman (left) and as a man (right) during his stint in Kew Asylum . A portrait of Edward De Lacy Evans in male and female attire. The image is probably a fake cut-and-paste produced by a photographer after it was discovered De Lacy Evans was a man . According to ship records, he was a 26-year-old Roman Catholic from Kilkenny who could read and write, and was listed as a housemaid. When she arrived in Victoria, Mr De Lacy Evans was still known as Ellen Tremayne and caused quite a stir on the trip over. According to the State Library of Victoria's The La Trobe Journal, he wore a man's shirt and trousers underneath his dress and had formed sexual attachments to some of the other female passengers on the Ocean Monarch, including his soon-to-be first wife, Mary Delahunty - a 34-year-old governess who was also from Ireland. He travelled with a trunk labelled with the name 'Edward De Lacy Evans' on it who, according to De Lacy Evans' third wife, was his uncle. There was also speculation her husband or lover was named 'Edward De Lacy Evans' and he had somehow tricked the transsexual by placing his trunk on the Ocean Monarch and deserted the 26-year-old. Mr De Lacy Evans', who was still identified as a woman, first job in Australia was as a maidservant at a Melton public house but some time after he left his position and started dressing like a man, and ditched the name of Ellen Tremayne. Mr De Lacy Evans continued living as a man for 25 years after he left Kew Asylum in 1879 (left) and the right picture is of him and his third wife, Julia Marquand . Now as Edmund De Lacy, he went and sought out Ms Delahunty, marrying her at St Francis' Roman Catholic Church in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. But their marriage was not a happy one, with evidence suggesting they 'did not live comfortably together'. After Ms Delahunty opened a school in Blackwood, she left Mr De Lacy Evans and married an American mining surveyor Lyman Oatman Hart who lived in Daylesford - north-west of Melbourne. In the next 20 years, Mr De Lacy Evans married twice - his second wife was Sarah Moore who died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1867 and a Julia Marquand of Bendigo - north of Melbourne. Mr De Lacy Evans worked as a carter, miner, blacksmith and ploughman in the areas of Blackwood, Bendigo and Stawell. The breakdown of his third marriage came after March 1878 when Ms Marquand gave birth to a child fathered by her brother-in-law, Jean Baptiste Loridan. Despite Mr De Lacy Evans knowing it was not his child, he registered himself as the child's father but his resentment over the pregnancy started taking its toll on the marriage. In July 1879, he started violently acting out against Ms Marquand and his 15-month-old daughter, fell into a deep depression and then was admitted to Bendigo Hospital's lunacy ward for amentia - a mental disability. Another portrait done of Mr De Lacy Evans done by Aaron Flegeltaub who was active between 1882-1891 . For the first six weeks of his stint in the hospital, Mr De Lacy Evans refused to bathe until he was transferred to the Kew Asylum and forcibly stripped that his secret was discovered. He was handed over to female nurses and forced to dress as a woman . In an interview, Mr De Lacy Evans' recalled the moment he was outed as a female at Kew Asylum. 'I was sittin’ the carriage at the railway station, an’ the wife was cryin’ and the kid was squealin’, an’ I was laughin’ at ‘em,' he said during an interview. 'Well, when we got to Kew, the fellers there took hold o’ me to give me a bath, an’ they stripped me to put me in the water, an’ then they saw the mistake. 'One feller ran off as if he was frightened; the others looked thunderstruck an’ couldn't speak. 'I was handed over to the women, and they dressed me up in frocks and petticoats.' Mr De Lacy Evans' outing as a female caused a worldwide stir, with one photographer named Nicholas White sneaking into the hospital and taking photos of the transsexual dressed as a man and a woman as well as possibly a straitjacket. As a transgender person, Mr De Lacy Evans' faced brutal treatment inside the asylum including a report done up by The Australian Medical Journal that said he cried and screamed as he was probed during a gynaecological examination - which verified he was a physiologically a woman. A drawing done of Mr De Lacy Evans entitled The Sandhurst impersonator working as a man at the Victorian goldfields . With the news in circulation, Mr De Lacy Evans received offers to be 'publicly exhibited' and after his release from Kew Asylum he took up the opportunities. He was once offered three to five pounds per week for a tour. He appeared as 'The Wonderful Male Impersonator' at St Georges Hall on Bourke Street in Melbourne in January 1880 and another time alongside a trapeze artist and 'The Electric Boy' at Sydney's Egyptian Hall on George Street in September 1880. When the truth came out his wife, Ms Marquand denied knowing her husband was in fact a woman and accounted for her daughter's existence by telling reporters: 'Some strange man entered the house one night about the time her husband should have returned home'. Ms Marquand also stated her husband would never let her see him stripped or washing himself. Additionally, Mr De Lacy Evans could have fooled his wife into thinking he was a man by fashioning a homemade strap-on dildo. There was also evidence Mr De Lacy Evans' second wife, Sarah Moore, found out about her husband's cross-dressing about a year into their marriage . A witness reported seeing Ms Moore punching Mr De Lacy Evans in the breast - her 'weak place'. Mr De Lacy Evans lived as a man for another 25 years and found no success in show business. In February 1881, he was applying for relief at the Melbourne Police Court and wanted to be admission to the Benevolent Asylum. Mr De Lacy Evans died in August 1901 in the Melbourne Immigrants’ Home at St Kilda Road, where he had been since February 1881.",

Cash: Politicians are angry that Tony Halsall, former head of the University Hospital of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, was given a package worth £250,000 when he stepped down . The head of a health trust which had the highest mortality rate in England received almost a quarter of a million pounds in severance pay, it was revealed last night. Tony Halsall was paid the sum after leaving his post at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in disgrace last year. The trust in Cumbria is currently the subject of a police probe into up to 16 needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers. And in a scandal which has been compared to that of Mid Staffordshire, recent data shows a total of 500 people may have needlessly died in the last four years. Yesterday, politicians reacted with fury at the payout, saying it was cheating taxpayers and ‘rewarding failure’. Mr Halsall stepped down in February 2012 but still receives his salary of £150,000 a year, which will only be cut off in October this year. It is understood the payments, which equate to £225,000 overall, were viewed as a severance package. Local Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: ‘The level of this package will shock people – £225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over.’ After Mr Halsall stepped down, he agreed to go on ‘secondment’ for 12 months. As part of the deal, he is also entitled to his existing benefits, his lease car and the costs of career management advice up to the value of £5,000. He will also be paid during a six-month notice period. He was gagged from talking about  it and the trust has until now refused requests to reveal the scale of the payout. MPs suggested they chose to release the information on Budget day in an attempt to ‘bury’ the news. During Mr Halsall’s tenure at the trust, it was criticised on several occasions by watchdogs including the Care Quality Commission and the Commons health select committee. Police are investigating deaths at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow, one of its two main maternity units. A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: 'The level of this package will shock people £225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over' Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status. Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients’ lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England. A new report into the CQC’s regulation of the trust, due to be published this month, is expected to find that it had failed to take adequate action to protect patients. John Cowdall, chairman of the trust, said the arrangement with Mr Halsall ‘avoided the potential for a long drawn out dispute that would have been expensive and time consuming’. The deal involved going on secondment to NHS Confederation as an associate director. The national body represents all those organisations which provide health services and speaks on their behalf. It is understood he took the role on condition that he would be paid his salary of £150,000 a year by the trust up to October 5, 2013.",

Facing prison: Handcuffed Lianne Smith leaving the court after being found guilty . Killer mother Lianne Smith today vowed to appeal after being found guilty of murdering her two children in Spain. Her lawyer said she was in 'a bad way' after the verdicts but would fight her conviction for smothering Rebecca, five, and baby Daniel, 11 months. Jenifer Lahoz Abos said: 'Lianne suffers from psychosis and cannot be held criminally accountable for her actions. No mother in her right mind would chose to end the lives of her children. 'She needs help. I spoke to her immediately after the conviction and she is in a very bad way. She has found the trial extremely difficult as it has brought back awful memories for her.' Smith suffocated the children with a plastic bag in the Hotel Miramar in the seaside resort of Lloret de Mar in May 2010. Last night at Girona Provincial Court, north-east Spain, a jury of seven men and two women unanimously found her guilty of double murder. Today she is on suicide watch in a Spanish prison. Smith, 45, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, is under constant supervision in a secure psychiatric hospital inside a jail called Brians 1 Penitentiary Centre near Barcelona. She is facing up to 34 years behind bars. Smith, a former county council children's services manager, is being watched 24 hours a day and will be assessed regularly by a prison psychiatrist. The hospital unit can house up to 60 male and female prisoners suffering from psychiatric illnesses. The jury rejected defence claims Smith was criminally insane, after hearing testimony from three psychiatrists during a four-day trial at Girona Provincial Court. Scroll down for video . Unanimous verdict: The jury rejected Smith's defence claim that she was mentally ill . Appalling case: Smith is led into the court in Girona, Spain, for the final day of her trial . The jury ruled Smith was 'fully conscious of what she did and that it was wrong'. Smith feared social services would take the children from her after her fugitive partner Martin Smith, a TV psychic, was arrested on child sex charges at their home in Barcelona. Girona Provincial Court heard the couple, who shared a surname but were not married, made a pact that they would kill themselves if they were ever separated. Blank stare: Lianne Smith looked impassive as the unanimous verdict was read out. Her TV psychic partner, Martin Smith (right) was found dead in his cell in January . Martin Smith, 46, from North Shields, was later jailed for 16 years for repeatedly raping his stepdaughter Sarah Richardson, now 24, but hanged himself in HMP Manchester in January, believing his partner had killed his young son and daughter. However the court heard DNA tests proved he was not in fact the father of either child. After killing them, Smith spent the night in the hotel room alongside their lifeless bodies writing a series of notes, including one to her children which read:\" ' love you very much. I wanted to give you a lovely life together. I'm very sorry.' She failed in several suicide attempts before asking a hotel receptionist to call police to the room. Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and . Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room . Smith, pictured with her son Daniel, was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner's hanging in prison . Smith had become obsessed with the idea social services would take her children from her and put them into care - which she considered a fate 'worse than death'. Prison psychiatrist Harry Barker told the court Smith viewed the children's deaths as an 'unavoidable catastrophe'. She suffers from an unspecified psychosis and was 'pathologically obsessed' with Martin Smith. But prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas told the jury her crimes were 'the most abominable, despicable, vile and horrific' imaginable. He called on the judge to jail her for 17 years for each count of murder. Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales will sentence her at a later date.",

Injuries: Jodie O'Donohoe, now aged 10, with permanent scars after face burns which her mother says were contributed to by head lice shampoo . The mother of a little girl who suffered appalling burns to her face believes a lice shampoo she was using contributed to the fire that caused the injuries. Nichola O’Donohoe has set up a Facebook page called Justice For Jodie in tribute to her now 10-year-old daughter’s bravery. And despite the fact that the accident occurred more than six years ago, Jodie is still receiving treatment for the burns. Her mother, Nichola, 44, said she had used the lice shampoo Prioderm and believes this may have contributed to the fire. Jodie’s father, Phil, 45, had put the treatment on both Jodie and her sister Jasmine, 12, after they caught head lice off their friends. But the manufacturers of the shampoo, Reckitt Benckiser, claim that there are no safety issues with the product if the instructions are followed. Mrs O’Donohoe said she had lit a candle with Jodie earlier on that day and said the flame was ‘nearly out’ and not powerful enough to cause damage. She was out at the time of the accident, and said: ‘Phil wouldn’t tell me what happened but I could hear Jodie screaming – I never expected what I was about to walk into. ‘I rushed home and there was a horrible stench of smoke and Jodie’s hair was all over the floor and then I knew. It was horrific. ‘Her face was burnt all over – her eyebrows, eyelashes, nose, ears, lips and the top of her head. It was terrible. She was shivering and had gone into shock. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.’ The County Tipperary, Ireland, schoolgirl has suffered tremendously since the accident, according to her family. Seriously injured: Jodie O'Donohoe was treated in hospital for six weeks following the incident which saw her suffer horrific burns . Her father, a carer for an Autism charity, tried to put the fire out but when he was unable to he put Jodie’s head under running water. Mrs O’Donohoe said: ‘I was in hell, absolute hell. I felt like I had been picked up and thrown head first into a blender. 'Jodie was only seconds away from burning everything on her face. Any longer and she would have lost her eyes, her whole face would have been gone.’ Jodie was treated in hospital for six weeks and was heavily sedated while she received treatment. Then and now: Jodie pictured aged five (left), just days before she suffered her burns, and pictured now as a ten year old (right) The family say they were told by doctors the burns would not heal and skin grafts were the only option. ‘They took the skin from her head so they had to shave her hair off. It was horrible. This was my little baby girl. 'She was such a beautiful girl people would swoon over her. She was absolutely perfect.’ Treatment: Mother Nichola claims that Prioderm head lice shampoo may have contributed to the fire which injured her daughter . Mrs O’Donohoe, who says she has suffered with post-traumatic stress since the accident, added: ‘Originally her face looked like red candle wax. We couldn’t go into a shop without people staring, pointing and even shrieking. 'Every time we went out I felt like I was being stabbed in the heart. ‘Luckily her features have recovered, her eyebrows and eyelashes have grown back. The fact Jodie is alive is only by the grace of God. Recovering: Jodie, pictured at the age of eight, three years after she suffered her horrific injuries . ‘Only now has she been able to talk about what happened. She couldn’t look at any pictures of her face. It is so difficult for her to talk about it.’ It is still not known exactly what caused the fire to break out. The manufacturers of Prioderm, Reckitt Benckiser, told the Irish Daily Mail yesterday: ‘At the time of the incident, which we understand was in 2007, Prioderm was part of the Seton/SSL portfolio which was later acquired by Reckitt Benckiser in November 2010. 'There are no safety issues with the product when used in accordance with the instructions.’ Campaign: Nichola O'Donohoe, right, believes a lice shampoo contributed to a fire which caused horrific injuries to daughter Jodie's (left) face .

        "document": "Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton jumped into the political story of the day late on Monday night with a tweet that compared people who deny the power of vaccines to those who question whether the earth is round or the sky is blue. Clinton is the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and the tweet was seemingly aimed Republican presidential hopefuls who have questioned whether vaccinations should be required and whether they are tied to mental disorders. Clinton ends the tweet with a nod to her granddaughter, Charlotte, who was born late last year. Clinton regularly used her grandmother status as a rhetorical tool while campaigning for Democrats in 2014. Federal health officials have expressed concern over a recent measles outbreak that has been fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules. Measles is a disease that children a regularly vaccinated against. The issue has become political, despite the fact that claims like vaccines leading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky questioned the safety of vaccines when he said he had \"heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\" \"I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they're a good thing. But I think the parents should have some input,\" he said during an interview on CNBC. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, when asked about the issue, said that he choose to vaccinate his children, but added, \"Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide.\" Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who is also exploring a 2016 run, told Buzzfeed that while she thinks vaccinating for the measles makes sense, the decisions should be up to the parents. But renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also a potential Republican presidential candidate, broke from the pack and defended mandatory vaccinations. \"Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them,\" he told Buzzfeed. But Carson aside, these comments from Paul, Christie and Fiorina contradict with what Clinton tweeted and President Barack Obama said in an interview on Sunday. \"I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,\" Obama told NBC News before the Super Bowl. \"The science is, you know, pretty indisputable.\" Both Obama and Clinton have altered their opinions on this issue, though, because during the 2008 presidential nomination fight, the two left the door open to vaccines causing autism and other issues. Obama said the science was \"inconclusive,\" while Clinton wrote in an anti-vaccine questionnaire that she was \"committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccine.\" The Republican National Committee noted that Clinton altered her position in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. \"Since Hillary Clinton is running for President Obama's third term, it's no surprise she abruptly changed her position just 24 hours after he restated his,\" said spokesman Michael Short.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- When Katy Wilson was born with Down syndrome, doctors told her mother that the infant likely would never walk or talk. Katy Wilson says she wants her athletic successes to surprise people and give them hope. She sure showed them. Wilson, now 29, has won two international gold medals in the Special Olympics for her gymnastic abilities. She turns cartwheels for her floor routine and does acrobatics on the balance beam. She also goes on public speaking tours. \"Most of all, I love doing speeches because I want them [the audience] to be surprised just how good my speeches are,\" she said by phone. Wilson's story -- and countless other stereotype-bending stories like it -- is possible in part because of the dogged vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the Special Olympics organization she founded more than four decades ago. Shriver, who died Tuesday, started the organization as a sports camp for special-needs kids and adults in her backyard in Maryland in 1962. The camp, in part, was inspired by the life of Shriver's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, who had an intellectual disability. The Special Olympics has grown from that small camp into a global organization that helps 3 million athletes with Down syndrome, autism and other intellectual disabilities compete for medals in an array of sports. Her legacy will live in the stories of hope and against-the-odds success she made possible through the Special Olympics.  See photos of Eunice Kennedy Shriver » . \"She helped forever alter how people with intellectual disabilities are viewed and treated and respected,\" said Amie Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Special Olympics. \"This is a population that 40 years ago they were beyond marginalized. They were disenfranchised from society. \"It was considered the status quo ... to put them in an institution and never think about that again. And she changed all of that. She brought them out into the light.\" An estimated 200 million people in the world live with intellectual disabilities. That population was largely unseen and voiceless in 1968 when Shriver stepped to the microphone to announce the start of the first Special Olympic Games at Chicago's Soldier Field. \"In ancient Rome, the gladiators went into the arena with these words on their lips,\" she told the 1,000 athletes in the stadium. \"'Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'\" In 2007, the most recent Special Olympics World Summer Games were held in Shanghai, China. More than 7,000 athletes competed. The sports competitions are held in the winter and summer on four-year intervals, just like the Olympic Games; people from countries as far-flung as Tunisia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka participate in events that include skiing, volleyball and track and field. Before the program, people with intellectual disabilities were only told what they could not accomplish, said David Tolleson, executive director of the National Down Syndrome Congress. \"Special Olympics emphasizes what folks can do, and it does it in a manner that's fun and exciting and it offers a sense of community both within the family of those with developmental disabilities as well as with the greater community at large -- the volunteers who come in and have some of their misconceptions or preconceptions cast aside when they realize how much people with developmental disabilities truly are capable of,\" he said. The program continues to expand its global reach, but in many places, people with intellectual disabilities lack basic human rights, said Dugan. Thomas Webb, a Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation fellow who studies public policy and intellectual disability, said it's still a challenge in the United States to integrate people with disabilities into mainstream society. No one knows all of the solutions, but Shriver and the Special Olympics have had \"significant impact\" on peoples' lives, he said. Coming from the athletic Kennedy family, Shriver realized the wide-ranging benefits of sports, said Dugan. \"It's just a fun way to bring people with intellectual disabilities and their non-disabled peers together,\" she said, \"because everyone enjoys competition and fun and exercise and getting out there.\" The fun translates into experience that helps Special Olympians build communities of friends and succeed in the workplace, advocates and athletes said. Melissa Stokes, 26, started playing sports with the Special Olympics when she was 8. She now is a volunteer Special Olympics ski coach in the Denver area and works as an assistant at the Special Olympics of Colorado office. \"We're like a little family,\" she said of her ski team. She added: \"Because we have special needs doesn't mean we can't do stuff. We can still accomplish a lot.\" More than half of Special Olympians in the U.S. are employed, according to the organization, compared with an estimated 10 percent of the intellectually disabled population at large. Jeanne Wilson, the mother of the gymnast with Down syndrome , started tearing up when she recounted the moment she saw her daughter -- whose future once looked so uncertain -- standing atop an awards podium with a gold medal draped around her neck. \"It was just amazing because that really gave her confidence. And I don't think people realize how much it means to a young person who you might have thought did not have a future or might not ever have a chance to walk,\" she said. \"To see her doing a routine on balance beam or a floor routine is pretty amazing.\" Katy Wilson, who lives in Gainesville, Georgia, continues to train as a gymnast. She also goes bowling with a group of Special Olympians most Fridays. They call themselves the Alley Kats, and Wilson describes the bowlers as some of her best friends. \"I love bowling because it is so much fun being out there being able to have friends,\" she said. \"It's exciting to do bowling because I get a lot of scores.\" When she's not in training, Wilson works at a steakhouse as a hostess. \"I get their coffee, I get their bread, I get their drinks, I do the silverware, I sweep up, I do the hostess,\" she said. \"Oh, I love the job because everybody's so nice to me, especially the managers, they give me hope and they're so excited to have me there and I'm so happy to be there with them.\" As a global ambassador for the Special Olympics, Wilson tours the country telling people about her life story. She says she hopes it reminds them that everyone can succeed with a positive attitude. She grew up watching her sister do cartwheels as a cheerleader. She modeled her life in her sister's image, but she forged a life that's all her own.",

On Sunday night, a South Carolina man was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and murder of an 8-year-old girl. Ricky Lee Blackwell Sr., 55, reportedly choked Heather Brooke Center and shot her four times in front of ex-wife Angela Davis and his grandsons in 2009, The Spartanburg Herald Journal reports. Blackwell and Davis were separated at the time and Davis was dating the child's father, Bobby Center. The murder was painted as an act of revenge, the paper says. Scroll down for video . Ricky Lee Blackwell, Sr. looks up briefly during the verdict announcement in his sentencing on March 16 Spartanburg, South Carolina. Blackwell has been sentenced to death for the murder of 8-year-old Heather Brooke Center . Ricky Lee Blackwell, Sr. talks with his attorneys during the sentencing phase on Sunday, March, 16, 2014 . The jury, consisting of five women and seven men, deliberated for more than five hours. Blackwell's execution is set for June 14 but is expected to be delayed as the case is appealed. Solicitor Barry Barnette told jurors that Center's parents would miss multiple memories with their daughter. 'They’ll never see her go on her first date,' he reportedly said during closing arguments. 'They won’t see her go to her first prom. They won’t see her graduate from high school. How much would they pay to have one phone call, to send a piece of mail to her?' Heather Brooke Center, pictured, was killed by Blackwell in 2009 . Center, pictured, was only 8 years old at the time of her death . Barnette also argued that Blackwell is not mentally retarded -- something the defense had claimed. Barnette, the paper reports, said the forensic psychologist who testified was not 'credible.' Two other psychologists did not find Blackwell to be intellectually disabled. Barnette, the paper adds, also said that Blackwell's suicide attempts -- including when he shot himself in the stomach after officers arrived responding to the 2009 shooting -- were grabs for attention.

'He is a tender, gentle, good person,' McGuire said. 'You couldn’t find one person to say a mean thing about him. He never had a mean word for anybody.'

        "document": "By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 10:39 EST, 3 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:44 EST, 3 August 2012 . A girl gang of Bulgarian pickpockets who targeted the disabled and blind in a campaign of thieving on public transport have been jailed. Gergina Georgjeva, 21, Dimitra Miteva, 33, and Parashkeva Ilieva, 40, stole mobile phones and purses from people on buses across London in a ‘deliberate campaign to make money’. One of the their victims was a blind woman on crutches. Caught pickpocketing: The three Bulgarian women will spend four months behind bars after stealing from several people across London . The trio from Tottenham, north London, used a strategy where two of them would stand near their target while the third acted as the ‘dipper’ to swipe the item. They have been jailed for four months. Prosecutor Gavin Ludlow-Thompson said the blind woman, Patricia Cairns was an easy target for their attack in February. He said: ‘She was a severely disabled person who is blind and also gets around on crutches. She therefore presented to the team, if I can call them that, an easy target.’ Miss Cairns became aware that something was amiss and tried to signal to the bus driver but the trio fled, pushing the emergency button which released the doors. Vulnerable victim: A blind woman using crutches was targeted by the gang while on board a bus in Oxford Street . Later that same day, the pickpockets stole an iPhone from a man waiting at a bus stop and on March 31 they stole a woman’s purse on board a bus in Stoke Newington, north London. They were also caught on CCTV pickpocketing in Sydenham and Brixton in south London and Tottenham in north London. In sentencing them, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: ‘You acted as a group or in pairs of individually as professional thieves on those who were using buses through a wide area of London. ‘It included the theft of a blind and disabled person who I judge to be a vulnerable person. Stealing spree: After stealing from the blind woman, the gang snatched an iPhone from a man waiting at a bus stop . ‘Each of you may show your remorse now but that does not affect the fact that this was a deliberate campaign by the three of you to make money. ‘These offences are so serious that a fine alone or community order could not be justified.’ Police were not aware the women lived and pickpocketed together until after investigations two separate arrests. Georgjeva was arrested on May 9 and received a five-week sentence for a similar matter. Two weeks later the other two were arrested when undercover cops saw them acting suspiciously. It was when police searched their house that they discovered Georgjeva also lived with them and was part of the gang. The stolen items have never been recovered but Georgjeva was charged with handling stolen goods and theft after a purse and Oyster card were found in her possession. Mateva and Ilieva claimed they came to the UK to find legitimate work to pay for medical care of their children with heart conditions back home in Bulgaria but fell into a life of crime, their lawyers said.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Many tall fliers know: Those precious exit row or bulkhead seats now often come with a price as airlines charge for the extra bit of legroom. That's not sitting well with Malcolm Johnson, a 6-foot-7-inch architect from Edmonton, Alberta, who says they should be available to tall travelers without the added cost. Johnson is on a mission to get Air Canada -- the airline he flies most -- to stop charging the fee. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency last year, but it was rejected in December on the grounds that he didn't fully qualify as a disabled person with a special condition, he said. Johnson is vowing to appeal the decision. \"It's a penalty for tall people ... to pay for those seats -- they're the only seats on the craft that we can fit into,\" he said. Air Canada has not responded to a request for comment. Johnson flies on the airline from Edmonton to France twice a year, but since there are no direct flights available, the journey usually requires four legs for a round-trip. He was always able to get a fairly comfortable seat at no charge, but that changed when the carrier implemented the fee about two years ago. Air Canada charges up to $50 for a coach seat with extra legroom on each flight, so Johnson ends up paying $200 extra, he said. If his wife comes along and wants to sit next to him, the couple ends up paying $400 extra. Johnson says it's not fair that some obese passengers who can't fit into one seat are entitled to a free extra seat according to Canadian law, but tall fliers aren't taken into consideration. \"People have said to me, why don't you fly first class? Well, it's 10 times the price to fly first class,\" Johnson said. \"Other people have said, well, why don't you just suck it up and sit down and shut up? And I say, that's fine for you because you're 5 foot 2 and it's all right. For tall people, it's a little different.\" Flying can be 'hell' for tall passengers . Johnson worries about deep vein thrombosis, a potentially deadly condition that can develop when people sit still for a long time. When forced to sit in a regular coach seat, his knee is jammed against the person in front, he said, so he always ends up paying the fee for preferred seats. Johnson says passengers who have a doctor's letter that verifies their height and their need for more room should not have to pay extra. Since Johnson started his campaign, many other tall fliers have contacted him with messages of support. E-mail is \"coming in every hour,\" he said.",

An ambulance crew were caught parked in a disabled bay while the went on a shopping trip - despite their being numerous free other spaces. Complaints were made after paramedics left their vehicle in a bay for blue-badge holders at Cameron Toll Shopping Centre in Edinburgh. The two crew members hopped out of the ambulance to pop into Sainsbury’s shortly after 10am on Tuesday - and emerged ten minutes later clutching shopping bags. An ambulance was caught parked in a disabled space so that they could go into a supermarket . Numerous free spaces were available at the time in the car park, which has space for 1,200 vehicles. It is understood that the on-duty paramedics were on a break at the time. Now they have been branded 'selfish' and 'lazy' by Scottish Patient Association chair Margaret Watt, who says there was 'no excuse' for their behaviour. She said today: 'These must be the two most selfish cads in Scotland. They have done a disabled person out of a space. 'If they had a disabled relative would they be OK with people doing this? 'A person using crutches, or in a wheelchair, may have come along to use that space while they went about their shopping. Cameron Toll Shopping Centre has space for 1,200 vehicles, and there were numerous free bays available . 'This is just the absolute height of laziness - they couldn’t be bother walking the extra distance from a normal space. 'I hope that strong disciplinary action is taken against them - this is unacceptable and inexcusable behaviour.' One 42-year-old shopper, from Niddrie, . who asked not to be named, said: 'I came out the door and couldn’t . believe what I was seeing. 'The ambulance looked like it had been abandoned - it was then I realised it was parked in a disabled space as well. 'I appreciate the job they do but it can’t be one rule for them and another for the rest of us. 'They came back about ten minutes later carrying Sainsbury’s bags.' Cameron . Toll manager Jim Riddell said: 'It has been brought to our attention . that an ambulance was parked in a disabled bay in the centre car park . and we are looking into this. 'There . are bays which are close to both entrances of the centre which are for . the use of disabled or infirm customers and our staff monitor their use . throughout the day.' A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: 'Crews remain available to respond to emergency calls for their entire shift and often take the opportunity to purchase food products for consumption whilst on their break. 'They should always park with due consideration for others, whilst trying to minimise any delay in returning to the vehicle for response to a call should this be required. 'We will address this matter internally.' Earlier this month, Fife paramedic Victoria Arnott was cleared of misconduct after she stopped to pick up her own medicine while responding to an urgent call.",

        "document": "United Airlines has apologized to a New Jersey mother who said the company 'humiliated' her by not allowing her disabled three-year-old daughter to sit on her lap during a flight -- even though the child is physically unable to sit up on her own. Elit Kirschenbaum said her flight from the Dominican Republic was delayed for nearly an hour in the Dec. 30 incident as a flight attendant insisted her daughter Ivy, a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, be placed in a seat on her own. The family, aware of federal safety regulations that children over two years old need their own seat, had bought an economy seat for Ivy but kept her with them in business class due to her condition. Outrage: The Kirschenbaum family were on their way back from a Christmas holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, when a United Airline flight attendant said Ivy, 3, (back right) had to sit in her own seat as she is over 2 . 'Humiliating': Mother-of-four Elit Kirschenbaum said the hour-long ordeal was humiliating for her family . Kirschenbaum wrote in a Tumblr post that three flight attendants walked by her with the three-year-old on her lap and made no comment. However, moments before the New Jersey-bound flight took off, a fourth flight attendant confronted Kirschenbaum about the seating arrangement. Describing the situation in a Facebook post, Kirschenbaum wrote that she thoroughly explained to the flight attendant that her daughter was unable to sit independently but the woman 'insisted on creating a scene.' 'The remaining 3 flight attendants pleaded our case, in fact one was in tears, but this one attendant dug her heels in and wouldn't budge,' Kirschenbaum wrote. 'All of my children were sobbing, my niece was sobbing, other passengers were getting involved yet this woman still displayed zero compassion.' She wrote on Tumblr that her husband pleaded with the flight attended with no success and ultimately approached the pilot asking for help. Ivy: Ivy (right) is a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, the most disabling form of spastic cerebral palsy . 'Offending: In a Jan. 1 tweet, Kirschenbaum wrote that the airline apologized to her and her family on behalf of the 'offending flight attendant' 'Behaved Poorly:' Kirschenbaum said the airline stated that the flight attendant 'behaved poorly' in the situation . Eventually, the airline allowed Ivy to lie across her parents' laps, strapped in, during take-off and landing. The rest of the flight was spent sat on their laps. However, Kirschenbaum said she was 'humiliated in front of a full flight of passengers,' and, demanding an apology from the airline, enlisted the support of the public on Twitter with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy. 'I don't want free flights and I'm not interested in contacting a lawyer as some people have suggested I should,' she said. 'I just want the airline to apologize.' She added on Facebook: 'United needs to be aware and held accountable for how they treat people with disabilities and their families.' Compensation: After the incident, Kirschenbaum said that she did not want compensation from the airline, but an apology . Hashtag: The mother-of-four took to Twitter to enlist public support with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy . A spokeswoman for United told ABC News: 'The parents, who were ticketed in first class, wanted to hold the child in their lap rather than have the child take the seat they'd purchased for her in economy. 'Federal safety regulations require any child over the age of two to have his or her own seat, and flight attendants are required by law to enforce that safety rule. 'As we did in this case, we will always try to work with customers on seating arrangements in the event of any special needs.' Many spoke out on Twitter about the airline's treatment of little Ivy and her family. In a statement posted one day after the incident, airline officials wrote 'We at United are sorry that the Kirschenbaums encountered difficulties with their seating while traveling with their 3-year-old daughter.' 'Rather Cold:' The incident even caught the attention of CNN's Jake Tapper who wrote on Twitter that the airline's initial statement to the Kirschenbaum family seemed 'rather cold' Intentions: The family reportedly purchased an economy ticket for little Ivy (right) intending to keep the child with them in business class . The incident even caught the attention of CNN's Jake Tapper who wrote on Twitter that the airline's initial statement to the Kirschenbaum family seemed 'rather cold.' After drawing public criticism, with Kirshenbaum's encounter being reported on multiple news sites, the airline apologized. In a Jan. 1 tweet, Kirschenbaum wrote that the airline apologized to her and her family on behalf of the airline and the 'offending flight attendant.'

Marrafa denied murder and tried to claim his actions were the result of mental impairment. However a jury did not believe his version of events and unanimously convicted Marrafa of murder. A judge at Reading Crown Court told him he must serve at least 14 years of a life sentence for throttling mother-of-six Maralhas. Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Dave Hubbard, said: 'Sandra Maralhas was the mother of six children, aged between one and 20, who have been left devastated, confused, shocked, and heartbroken by her death. 'Even though Marrafa admitted he had killed her, he refused to plead guilty and put her son and others through the ordeal of giving evidence in court. 'I am pleased with the verdict and sentence handed down today, which reflects the fact Marrafa has shown no remorse for his terrible crime.' Jurors were told the victim had left home because of emotional abuse and physical violence but that she had continued to see her unemployed killer - to pay him some of the benefit money she received for their children. She had also had an abortion just four days before she died but she had kept that and the fact that she was pregnant from Marrafa. The 46-year-old defendant told startled police he had left his girlfriend's body in the bedroom of the home he had once shared with her. He also confided with them that he had not called an ambulance and nor did he know if she were alive or dead. Just hours before her death Marrafa had left a doctor's surgery with his former partner where he had been prescribed medication after complaining of being depressed. Floral tributes: Flowers left outside the house where Sandra Maralhas was found . When police forced their way into the flat in Coronation Square, Reading, Berkshire, they found the body of 38-year-old Ms Maralhas slumped at the foot of the bed and although police and paramedics tried to revive her, there were unable to. A post mortem examination showed that she had been strangled and that her killer could have had his hands tightly around her neck for as long as three minutes. The couple had met in 1998 in their native Portugal when Ms Maralhas already had three children from a previous relationship. They moved to the UK in 1999, initially living with Ms Maralhas' sister Rute. Ms Maralhas worked as a cleaner and later at a newsagent, and although Marrafa had found work in the building trade he was unemployed at the time of his partner's death. A psychiatrist acting for Marrafa's defence team has said that he was suffering from a depressive disorder which caused an abnormality of his mental function, which would reduce his responsibility for the killing.",

        "document": "Barbara Harris (pictured) is head of the equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust which drew up the guidelines . Bosses at an NHS trust have  issued a bizarre list of guidelines to stop anyone at their Christmas party facing  discrimination. The equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust assembled the list of discriminatory party pitfalls which include catering food for all religious, cultural and disability requirements. Their leaked Equality Bulletin seems to indicate that office parties in the NHS are viewed as a  minefield of political correctness. The extraordinary briefing told party organisers that 'there could be the potential for claims of sexual discrimination' if they did not ensure that the bash was scheduled for a time and location where women with 'caring responsibilities' would be able to attend. It also warned staff that the staple of office parties - enjoying a few Christmas drinks - could also be deemed discriminatory because people under 18 would not be able to join in. 'If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18s they should not be drinking alcohol.' The food on offer is also highlighted as a potential pitfall, with the authors stating: 'You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.' Managers were also told they should carry out 'a full risk assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.' It was drawn up by the equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. The head of the team is Barbara Harris - referred to in the briefing as 'Babs' - who earns a £50,854 a year salary overseeing the hospital's equality programme. Last year the trust announced it would have to make £30m of cuts. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, today blasted the document as a 'total waste of money.' The guidelines from the Trust, which runs The Royal County Sussex Hospital, have been ridiculed as a 'total waste of time... and money' He said: 'When we're trying to make savings, having an employee write up commonsense rules for having fun at a Christmas party seems like a total waste of time, effort, and taxpayers' money. 'The cost of the Nanny State continues to be placed on the back of hard-working ordinary people.' The briefing's authors urge party organisers to choose a date which does not clash with other staff's religious festivals or requirements, stating: 'It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust's Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.' It also warns employees against calling in sick the next day with a hangover, stating: 'Absence from work following Christmas parties/events - it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.' Finally, it lists contact details for three companies providing interpreting services, as well as an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf. The Trust issued the ten guidelines to ensure no-one was at risk of discrimination at their Christmas party. 1. Employees are reminded: ‘It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust’s Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.’ Organisers should remember that not all staff celebrate Christmas, so it is vital to make sure parties don’t clash with other, non-Christian religious festivals. 2. ‘There could be the potential for claims for sex discrimination.’ Women with ‘caring responsibilities’ should not be excluded. Nor should any staff currently on maternity or paternity leave. 3. Agency workers should also have access to the party. 4. ‘If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18’s they should not be drinking alcohol.’ 5. ‘By choosing a venue that does not enable access, could potentially be cause for disability discrimination (remember disability covers more than just physical access, toilets, etc). Disabled employees must not be treated less favourably than non-disabled employees.’ 6. Party planners must remember they have a ‘duty of care’ towards those who attend. Make sure there are designated drivers and keep the number of a local taxi firm handy in case someone is too drunk to drive home. 7.  ‘Absence from work following Christmas parties/events — it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e. a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.’ 8. ‘Managers . . . should carry out a full assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.’ 9.‘You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.’ 10. Emergency numbers are listed for three companies providing interpreting services, plus an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf.",

The blind and visually impaired will soon be able to find out through a project that has developed 3D printed tactile pictures of the cosmos. Astronomers from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland are using images taken by the Hubble telescope and translating them into something that can be felt on plastic. Scroll down for video... Researchers are experimenting with 3D printing o transform astronomy education by turning images from the Hubble Space Telescope into tactile 3D pictures for people who cannot explore celestial wonders by sight . The incredible iconic image of the star cluster NGC 609, for instance, shows several new stars circling around a striking bubble of gas and dust. Visually it’s stunning, and recreating that experience through touch is a major challenge as researchers can't really see space objects in three dimensions. ‘The work is scientific, but it's also guesswork and artistry to try to produce an object, which printed, will look like the image that Hubble has taken,’ said astronomer Antonella Nota. This incredible iconic image of the star cluster NGC 609 shows several new stars circling around a striking bubble of gas and dust. It is the first to be translated into plastic using 3D printing . So far, the scientists have developed 3D tactile prototype representations in plastic showing the stars, filaments, gas, and dust seen in the visual image using textures such as raised open circles, lines, and dots . Astronomers in Maryland have so far developed 3D representations of filaments, gas, and dust seen in the star cluster NGC 602. Using a 3D printer, they represented each feature using different textures on a plastic sheet including raised open circles, lines, and dots. These . features also have different heights to correspond with their . brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight . group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the . cluster. The team is now designing a way of . rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its true 3D shape. ‘We are basically designing the process from scratch.’ So far, the scientists have developed 3D tactile prototype representations of the stars, filaments, gas, and dust seen in NGC 602 using various textures such as raised open circles, lines, and dots. These features also have different heights to correspond with their brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the cluster. The 3D printouts of NGC 602 are a first steps towards the team’s goal of creating a 3D model of the cluster that people will be able to hold in their hands and study. ‘Imagine making a visualisation that you visually fly through, and as you fly through, first you encounter filaments, and then you see some dust and also some stars,’ said researcher Carol Christian. The team is designing a way of rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its 3D shape . ‘As you fly to the back side of the cavity, you see other features. I want to represent that in 3D and have people feel it with their fingers because they can't see it. ‘They would be able to spatially understand where important features are relative to everything else and what the structure is.’ So far, the group has tested the prototype images with about 100 people with visual impairments. They discovered through testing that the textures that were distinctive on the swell-form paper were not always as clearly perceived on the 3D plastic prints. The features have different heights to correspond with their brightness. The tallest, and therefore brightest, features are a tight group of open circles, which represent the stars in the core of the cluster . ‘Sure, we cannot see the image, so we don't know exactly what it looks like,’ said Nijat Worley of Baltimore who has a visual impairment. ‘It can never replace pictures, but with this 3D image you can get an idea of what it's supposed to look like and then use your imagination for the rest,’ she added. The team is now designing a way of rendering the nebula's structure onto a sphere that represents its true three-dimensional shape.",

David Hayes, 58, from Acomb, North Yorkshire, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was just five years old and has spent his life struggling to walk and using wheelchairs. It was only when his son, Philip, 31, started feeling pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago that doctors quickly realised the condition may be a congenital deformity. Now, almost half a century after he was first diagnosed, Mr Hayes has undergone knee and hip replacements , as well as an operation on his shoulder ball and socket, which has left him completely pain free. Mr Hayes, the former national vice chairman of charity Scope, said: 'I couldn't walk until I was six and it was always very painful. I was sent to a special school as they thought I would never really be able to do anything. 'When I was eight they transferred me to mainstream school because they realised my intelligence appeared to be normal. 'I never let the condition I thought I had hold me back but I accepted that I would always be in pain and there was no cure. 'To find out that the condition I actually had could be treated was a dream come true.' The father of two, who also has a daughter called Anne-Marie, said he owed a lot to the orthopaedic teams from York District Hospital who have operated on him over the last 12 weeks. He said: 'I have two children and my son started having a pain in his left hip every winter. 'After that it was obvious to doctors that it might be a congenital condition that I had passed down to him. They then realised it was operable.' He said he now feels like the Six Million Dollar Man - the fictional television character who was given bionic implants - after the operations allowed him to walk without pain for the first time in his life. He said: 'When I was a child I used to watch the programme, the Six Million Dollar Man, and I thought why they couldn't do that for me so I could walk? That's come true. 'The NHS has done that for me. There's a lot of knocking of the NHS but these were risky operations and for them all to be successful is remarkable.' The father of two only found out he had a congenital deformity as opposed to cerebral palsy when his son Philip, 31, started suffering similar problems five years ago and doctors realised it could be a genetic issue . Over the last 12 weeks, Mr Hayes has undergone a number of operations, including a hip and knee replacement, at York District Hospital (pictured) and can now walk completely pain-free for the first time . David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy - a neurological condition which affects movement and co-ordination – when he was aged five. He couldn’t walk until he was aged six and as he grew older he struggled to walk unaided and relied heavily on wheelchairs. He was in a lot of pain and didn’t doubt his diagnosis as symptoms of cerebral palsy include muscle stiffness and weakness, balance and co-ordination problems and uncontrolled body movements - all issues he was suffering with. There is no cure for the condition so Mr Hayes was forced to live with the diagnosis. However, when his son Philip, 31, started suffering from pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago, doctors realised the pair could be suffering from the same condition. After ruling out that Philip was suffering from cerebral palsy, medics started to investigate his symptoms and realised he was suffering from a congenital deformity passed down from his father. Congenital anomalies, which can result in long-term disabilities, are wide-ranging and in some cases – like the Hayes - can cause weak muscle tone and developmental delay. During adulthood, individuals with a congenital deformity experience reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs, an abnormal curvature of the spine, impaired muscle co-ordination, and joint deformities. David experienced these symptoms as a child but it wasn't until his son was genetically-tested that doctors realised they both shared the gene and that his symptom was hereditary instead of cerebral palsy. Having spent 15 years on the board of directors for Scope and four as national vice chair, Mr Hayes retired in 2007 due to his medical situation. He also previously chaired North Yorkshire Police Independent Advice Group and now hopes to return to work to help 'pay the NHS back'. His desire to return to work has seen him write to every police force in the country to inquire about employment opportunities. He said: 'I want to work to pay the NHS back. What's the point in having all this done and sitting at home?'",

        "document": "Washington (CNN) -- A congressional panel investigating claims the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary mishandled the remains of hundreds of fallen U.S. military personnel will meet for the first time Tuesday. In November, U.S. Air Force investigators announced they had found \"serious misconduct\" and \"gross mismanagement\" in the handling of remains at the base. The findings came after the Air Force conducted a year-long investigation into 14 allegations of wrongdoing made by whistleblowers involving the remains of four U.S. service members killed in action, the Pentagon official said. The panel, which is being chaired by retired Gen. John Abizaid, has been given \"full authority to review all aspects of mortuary affairs to ensure we are meeting the highest standards of care for our fallen.\" Department of Defense spokesman Capt. John Kirby said. Abizaid retired from the Army in 2007 after leading U.S. Central Command the final three years of his 34-year military career. Last week, the Air Force admitted that it sent more sets of military personnel remains to a Virginia landfill than it originally acknowledged. Backtracking on initial information about how it handled the remains of American service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Air Force said the cremated body parts of hundreds of the fallen were burned and dumped in the landfill. Earlier, the Air Force said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner. The Washington Post broke the story, and the Air Force now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the base mortuary were cremated, incinerated and buried with medical waste. That procedure was in place between November 2003 and May 1, 2008. The Air Force also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of, first by cremation, then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill. Congressman Rush Holt, D-New Jersey, Thursday accused the Pentagon of what he called \"willful blindness\" in not acting faster to identify and correct the problems and fully report them. \"For years, this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and, I would say, dishonorably,\" Holt said in a telephone interview. He said he had been asking the Pentagon for months about information about Dover, on behalf of a constituent whose husband was killed five years ago. \"They don't get it. They don't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this,\" Holt said. Last month, the Defense Department told the congressman that exact numbers could not be determined. \"Without individual case-by-case review, the exact number of Service-directed disposition of subsequent remains cannot be determined,\" said a fact sheet sent to Holt in November. \"It would require a massive effort and time to recall records and research individually.\" When bodies are not intact -- for instance, in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the Air Force Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Families can elect to be notified when parts are identified or leave it up to the military to dispose of them appropriately. Since the policy was changed in 2008, the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea. Holt pointed to how the United States spends millions each year searching for the remains of service members missing in action from previous wars, for instance in Southeast Asia. \"That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that,\" Holt said. \"It is a level of response that honors our soldiers.\" The mistakes at Dover send a different message, Holt said. \"It sends shudders to think that we engage in this kind of desecration,\" he said. But at the Pentagon, aides to Panetta said he is satisfied with how the Air Force responded in regard to the landfill policy and new information about how many of the American fallen were involved. \"I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this,\" said Kirby.

        "document": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two mentally disabled women were strapped with explosives Friday and sent into busy Baghdad markets, where they were blown up by remote control, a top Iraqi government official said. Iraqi soldiers secure the scene of a bombing Friday at a popular pet market in central Baghdad. The bombs killed at least 98 people and wounded more than 200 at two popular pet markets on the holiest day of the week for Muslims, authorities said. In both bombings, the attackers were mentally disabled women whose explosive belts were remotely detonated, Gen. Qasim Atta, spokesman for Baghdad's security plan, told state television. Atta said the women were strapped with dynamite and ball bearings, citing members of the bomb squad. The explosives were detonated via cell phone, he said. An Atta aide said that people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad's al-Ghazl market as the \"crazy woman\" and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability. The aide said authorities believe the women were unaware of plans to detonate the explosives.  Watch how the use of the women represents a new tactic » . The nationalities and identities of the women have not been released. U.S. military officials referred to the two attacks as suicide bombings, saying both women detonated the explosive devices. The U.S. officials also gave a much lower casualty toll, with 27 civilians dead and 53 others wounded. The Pentagon attributed the attacks to al Qaeda in Iraq and made no reference to the mental conditions of the women. \"By targeting innocent Iraqis, they show their true demonic character,\" said Lt. Col. Steve Stover, spokesman for the Multi-National Division-Baghdad. \"They care nothing for the Iraqi people; they want to subjugate them and forcefully create a greater Islamic sharia state,\" he said, referring to Islamic law. The violence marked the bloodiest series of attacks in Baghdad since August, breaking a brief stretch of relative calm as attacks and deaths dropped after the 2007 increase in U.S. troop strength called the surge. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the attacks show the reality of the continuing struggle against militants, adding that Iraqis have turned against \"these terrible, violent people in their midst who will do anything.\" \"It certainly underscores and affirms the decision of the Iraqi people that there is no political program here that is acceptable to a civilized society, and that this is the most brutal and the most bankrupt of movements that would do this kind of thing,\" she said at a press briefing. \"And I think that will underscore for the Iraqis, and it will make them tougher in the fight.\" The first bomb blew up at al-Ghazl animal market around 10:30 a.m., killing 69 and wounding more than 140. The second blast happened about a half-hour later in the New Baghdad neighborhood pet market, killing 29 people and wounding 67. Al-Ghazl pet market is a popular destination where people buy and sell cats, dogs, monkeys and other animals. Attackers have struck the market on Fridays -- its busiest day -- several times in the last year or so. A January 2007 bombing killed 15 and wounded 52 at the pet market, and 13 people died and 58 were wounded in a November attack. Other developments .

        "document": "(CNN) -- Hours after getting laid off, a 36-year-old Minneapolis man returned to his former workplace and opened fire, killing five, including a business owner recently honored at the White House, before turning his gun on himself. Minneapolis police and city officials described Friday what happened over the span of 10 or 15 minutes the previous afternoon, when the man walked through the loading dock of Accent Signage Systems and started shooting. \"It was a hellish time,\" police Chief Timothy Dolan said. The dead include Reuven Rahamim, the company's founder and president of a fast-growing company that specializes in interior signs that help the visually impaired. The Israeli-born Rahamim \"came to this country to live the American dream, and he did,\" said Mayor R.T. Rybak. But beyond growing his business, the 61-year-old also had \"an enormously important part of this community,\" active on several task forces and groups. \"He's an example of somebody who climbed the ladder of success and didn't pull (the ladder) up but tried every way possible to get other people up on that rung, too,\" Rybak said. \"We owe a tremendous debt to Reuven.\" According to the mayor, civic leaders volunteered Rahamim's name when the White House asked for examples of \"good, small, local businesses doing exporting.\" The Minnesota resident went to the White House in March, and the White House called Friday to offer its condolences over Rahamim's death, Rybak said. A 29-year UPS employee, Keith Basinski, was shot dead on the loading dock, according to Jill Schubert, the president of the delivery company's Northern Plains district. Dolan said Basinski, 50, was simply in the \"wrong place, wrong time.\" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner identified all of the victims, including Rahamim and Basinski, on Friday night. They include Jacob Beneke, 34; Ronald Edberg, 58; and Rami Cooks, 62. Cooks is the only one of the victims who succumbed to his injuries at a local hospital -- the others died at the scene -- according to the medical examiner. The police chief said the shooter is believed to be Andrew Engeldinger. Dolan said the 36-year-old was fired Thursday morning and then came to Accent in the city's Bryn Mawr neighborhood about 4:25 p.m. and \"immediately started shooting\" but spared some, especially as he moved through the office building. Officers arrived within minutes and went into the complex, quickly finding casualties, the police chief said. No more shots were fired after they arrived. They found Engeldinger in the basement, where he had committed suicide, according to the medical examiner. \"He was in a location where there was one casing on the floor, and he was dead,\" Dolan said Friday afternoon. Engeldinger's mother and father read a brief statement Friday outside their home in nearby Richfield. \"Our son struggled for years with mental illness,\" the parents said after offering their condolences to the shooting victims. \"In the last few years, he no longer had contact with us. This is not an excuse for his actions but, sadly, may be a partial explanation.\" A 9 mm semiautomatic Glock pistol was used in the shooting, according to Dolan. Police also searched Engeldinger's Minneapolis apartment and found another handgun \"and packaging for 10,000 rounds of ammunition,\" the chief added. Two men remained hospitalized Friday, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, according Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Steven McCarty. The officers who responded have been put on leave, which the chief said can happen \"if they experience something traumatic.\" Rybak said officials will work to make sure that Accent Signage Systems remains in business after its founder's violent death. Since being founded in Rahamim's basement in 1984, Accent has steadily grown -- including developing a patent for technology that imprints Braille on things like hotel room numbers and restroom signs -- and now employs 30 people and earns $5 million to $10 million each year, CNN affiliate KARE reported. \"(Accent employees) had a horrible day that is beyond what anybody should have to have, but we owe it to them to make sure that they have many more productive days at work,\" Rybak said. \"And we will be focused on that as we move forward.\"",

Prosecutors said Wednesday that Philip Chism has been indicted as a youthful offender on charges of attempted murder by strangulation, assault with intent to murder, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He could face adult penalties if convicted. Prosecutors allege Chism attacked the 29-year-old woman on June 2 after following her into a bathroom at the youth facility in Boston where he was held. Scroll down for video . Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker . Co-workers stopped him when she cried for help. The woman declined medical treatment. Chism has pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a school bathroom in October. Last month he was described as 'psychotic'by state prosecutors in a petition to have him evaluated and put under strict security. According to the petition to have Philip Chism committed to Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital for 30 days of evaluation and treatment, the 15-year-old was 'out of touch with reality' and 'yelling, screaming incoherently [and] foaming at the mouth while being restrained by staff.' The attack happened June 2 at a Department of Youth Services detention center. The details were released Tuesday by a Superior Court judge in response to a motion by The Salem News. Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident. Prosecutor . Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down . out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her . while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she . screamed. In the petition to have Chism committed, psychologist Kenneth Rogers wrote that the teenager strangled, punched and stabbed the female unit clinician. 'Once pulled off her, he was out of touch with reality, screaming, yelling and moaning incoherently for about two hours even as he was taken away,' wrote Rogers. The document also stated that Chism's mother informed officials that before the June 2 attack her son had no history of psychosis.

During a hearing held June 10, the . prosecutor insisted that Chism not be left alone with female staff at . the facility, describing the teen as 'someone who appeared utterly calm . and fine in the moments leading up to the event.' Kate . MacDougall also expressed concern that within the detention center, . patients are free to move around, which could potentially put female . staff and patients at risk . Lester Blumberg, the Department of Mental Health attorney who represented the hospital at the hearing, assured the prosecutor that while the patients' rooms are not locked, Chism remains under guard at night and is rarely alone.

Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene.

        "document": "(CNN) -- The Newtown, Connecticut, police chief has withdrawn a recommendation to fire an officer diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and haunted by the horrific images of the mass shooting at an elementary school there. In a December 5 letter to the Newtown Board of Police Commissioners, Police Chief Michael Kehoe said he was withdrawing an earlier \"request and recommendation\" that Officer Thomas Bean be fired. Bean was one of the first officers to respond to the December 2012 shooting that left 26 dead, including 20 children. He told CNN that continues to have flashbacks and is left crying some nights by memories of the bloodshed. \"Nothing could prepare you for that,\" Bean, a 12-year veteran, recently told CNN's Susan Candiotti. \"The worst possible scenes you could think of ... because all there was, was horror.\" Bean was diagnosed with PTSD and has not been able to return to work. Six months after the mass shooting, the officer -- who responded to the tragedy on his day off -- was placed on long-term disability, according to Bean and his union. \"That day killed me inside,\" he said. Training the brain to stress less . A letter from the police department, obtained by CNN, confirmed that he was \"permanently disabled\" and could be fired. Bean and his union representative said Newtown could afford to pay only two years of long-term disability. Bean said he has a dozen years left on the job before being able to retire and believes his benefits should continue through his normal retirement date. But the town has refused to arbitrate the issue, Bean said. \"The town no longer intends to fire me,\" he said. \"Instead they have decided to let my long-term disability benefits expire in a year and then move on. I am sorry that I can no longer be a police officer, but I cannot change what happened that day or how it has affected me.\" Bean and his union representative intend to file a lawsuit by the end of the month, he said. \"The town agreed with the union that no one would suffer financially from this, but they lied because they are hell-bent on ruining my life through financial burdens, not allowing me the right to work elsewhere and the continuous retraumatization of myself and my family,\" Bean said. Bean recently told CNN that he broke down in tears after Sandy Hook Elementary School was cleared. He drank and smoked excessively. He even contemplated cutting himself with a razor. \"I didn't want to kill myself but I wanted to feel something,\" he said. \"Had no feeling, no sensation, no nothing.\" Adam Lanza, 20, shot and killed 20 young children and six teachers in the school before taking his own life -- a massacre that prompted a national debate over tougher gun laws. Bean said he knew he was in \"deep, deep trouble\" after entering a store one day. \"I looked at everyone in that store like they was going to kill me,\" he said. \"I could not get out of that store fast enough. I looked around, and there was a crowd of people, and all I saw were flashbacks -- (the) firehouse with the families or what I saw that day.\" Bean, 38 and married with two children, remains in therapy. He said he is grateful for support from one group in particular, Save a Warrior. Bean urges others suffering from PTSD to seek help. \"The Save A Warrior program that I went through is free,\" he said. \"We even had some law enforcement from LAPD and NYPD go through the program.\" Other Newtown police officers were diagnosed with PTSD, but Bean was the only one unable to return to work, union officials said. \"If I had my arm chopped off, they'd would say, 'Oh yeah, he's hurt.' But instead they're like, 'We can sweep (this) under the rug and not necessarily have to pay because ... it's not physically seen.' That's the problem with PTSD ... people don't see it,\" said Bean, his voice trailing off.",

        "document": "Her bizarre New Age views on topics such as reincarnation and UFOs have often left the public baffled. Now Shirley MacLaine has provoked widespread fury by claiming the victims of the Holocaust may have brought their fate upon themselves. The veteran Hollywood actress suggests the six million Jews and millions of others systematically murdered in Hitler’s death camps in the 1940s were ‘balancing their karma’ for crimes committed in past lives. She also suggests that cosmologist Professor Stephen Hawking may have subconsciously given himself his debilitating motor neurone disease. Really, Shirley? Actress Shirley MacLaine has been denounced by Jewish campaigners and other activists after suggesting that the millions of victims of Nazi death camps may have needed to balance their karma . Miss MacLaine’s comments, in a recently published book, were attacked last night by Jewish campaigners and other activists as offensive and wrong. In her memoir, the 80-year-old, who won an Oscar for Terms Of Endearment, writes: ‘What if most Holocaust victims were balancing their karma from ages before, when they were Roman soldiers putting Christians to death, the Crusaders who murdered millions in the name of Christianity, soldiers with Hannibal, or those who stormed across the Near East with Alexander? The energy of killing is endless and will be experienced by the killer and the killee.’ A spokesman for the Community Security Trust, which campaigns against anti-Semitism, said: ‘The first impressions are that these comments will offend and bemuse many Jews – and many other people too.’ In her book What If..., Miss MacLaine, who was raised a Baptist but is well known for her unconventional views on reincarnation and alien life, suggests Professor Hawking had subconsciously brought his crippling medical condition on himself. She says he may have created his illness in order to ‘free his mind’ from the needs of his body, so he could focus completely on his scientific research. 'Balancing their karma': Jewish women and children at Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Miss MacLaine suggested they may have been Roman soldiers in their previous incarnations . Miss MacLaine, who has previously insisted that she lived on Atlantis in an earlier life, claims to be friends with the scientist, whose life inspired the award-winning film The Theory Of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne. Her book – subtitled A Lifetime Of Questions, Speculations, Reasonable Guesses And A Few Things I Know For Sure – poses the question: ‘Did he “create” the disease that has crippled him in order to learn to be dependent on caregivers and the kindness of strangers so that he could free his entire mind to the pursuit of knowledge? ‘Did he “create” the disease that has crippled him?' asks Miss MacLaine of the disabled cosmologist Stephen Hawking, pictured with Eddie Redmayne . ‘What if he inadvertently chose to set an example of himself to show the rest of us that cosmic travel and universal understanding are available, regardless of one’s physical condition or circumstance? 'If Jesus chose to die in a state of martyrdom, then Stephen Hawking could just as readily have chosen to live in a dual state of being: visibly physical weakness and unseen knowledge and power. What if all reality is an illusion?’ Her views were branded ‘utterly ridiculous’ by disability charity Scope, while a spokesman for Disability Rights UK added: ‘She obviously has some very confused ideas that a lot of disabled people will be baffled by. 'It’s completely wrong to say people choose their disabilities, especially Professor Stephen Hawking, who has a genetic condition.’ Miss MacLaine, who played Lady Grantham’s American mother in Downton Abbey, writes that she is recognised more for her part in the ITV drama than for any of her film roles. She also suggests that she felt so at home on the set because she may have lived in the 1920s during a past life. Representatives for Miss MacLaine declined to comment last night.",

Patients turning to cosmetic surgery must be protected from cowboy surgeons and dangerous treatments, said the head of the NHS. Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh is calling for new laws to overhaul the booming £2.3billion sector, with the first as early as next year. One procedure singled out for criticism was the use of fillers, which have soared in popularity. These injections plump up the skin, fill in wrinkles and crow’s feet to create younger-looking cheeks and lips. A review led by Sir Bruce warned that filler jabs were subject to ‘no more controls than a bottle of floor cleaner’. Some patients suffered  disfigurement, bruising and blindness. ‘The most striking thing is that anybody, at any time, anywhere, can give a filler to anybody else and that’s bizarre,’ said Sir Bruce. His report said the practice was a ‘crisis waiting to happen’. Dr Andrew Vallance-Owen, who sat on the review, said: ‘We want proper professional requirements. This is not “inject oranges and get a certificate”. This is proper training.’ The committee also called for a crackdown on the ‘hidden advertising’ of plastic surgery, including TV shows such as The Only Way is Essex which ‘trivialise’ the procedures. Celebrity culture: Health officials say programmes such as The Only way is Essex (pictured left, Amy Childs) had turned cosmetic surgery into an 'everyday product'. Model Katie Price (right) has had many procedures . A register of breast implant patients must be set up within the next 12 months, it added. This follows the PIP scandal in which thousands of women were given sub-standard products. The key demands of the review are: . Former glamour model Alicia Douvall, who has had 308 cosmetic treatments, believes there should be tighter regulation in the industry . Sir Bruce said: ‘At the heart of this report is the person who chooses to have a cosmetic procedure.We have heard terrible reports about a person who has trusted a cosmetic practitioner but, when things have gone wrong, have been left high and dry. These people have not had the safety net that those using the NHS have. This needs to change.’ His report said the rules have been outstripped by the booming sector, which increased five-fold in value from 2005-2010 to £2.3billion. Pat Dunion, of Transform, Britain’s biggest plastic surgery group, said the cost of training and registration would force some cowboy clinics to close. The Royal College of Surgeons called on ministers to implement the  proposals ‘without delay’. Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic  Surgeons, said making fillers prescription-only would regulate which ones come onto the market, who can inject them and ban their advertising.",

        "document": "Pamela Scott's unrelenting headaches left her in agony, and she was actually relieved when doctors diagnosed her with a brain tumour. But the relief was short-lived. The 56-year-old from Morro Bay, California, was soon told removing the tumour would involve invasive surgery that could leave her blind or brain damaged. Unsure if she wanted to take the risk, she began  researching her options online, and found a way of removing the tumour without cutting open the head: accessing the brain through the eyelid. The procedure, performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams, involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye. This allows doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard-to-reach centre of the head. Pamela Scott was suffering unrelenting headaches, but doctors said the only way to remove the tumour that was causing them was to cut open her skull and get past her brain, risking blindness and brain damage. She found another way to access the tumour: through the eyelid. She is pictured with a 3D model of her skull . Less invasive brain surgery is currently not common, but some surgeons are developing different ways to be able to access tumours, aneurysms and other problems without the trauma of cutting open the head, in the hope that patients will recover faster as a result. Ms Scott was diagnosed with a meningioma - a benign tumor that started in the brain's protective covering and grew into the bone and near her optic nerve – behind her left eye. Reaching this spot - above and behind the eyes, the underside of the brain - is a surgical challenge. Traditional surgery means making a large opening in the skull to give doctors plenty of room to manoeuvre. But they must move painstakingly past sections of healthy brain. Ms Scott was warned that because her tumour was in such a tough location, vision or even cognitive damage was a risk of the top-down surgery. Sometimes, surgeons can snake their tools through the passages in the nose instead, which gives them a straighter shot through a natural opening. Now the eye is offering some paths into this difficult region, too. One location where the surgery is performed is the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Skull Base Surgery. Dr Paul Gardner, director of the centre, said the eye socket is like an ice cream cone, with the tip pointing back towards the brain's centre. Accessing the brain through the eye, known as a 'transorbital' approach, is now being performed by a small number of highly specialised surgical teams. It involves making a small incision in the crease of the eye, allowing doctors to go past the eyeball and get into the hard-to-reach center of the head. They remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket. Entering the socket at a different angle, doctors also can make a cut in the crow's feet at the corner of the eye. Or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow, making a small hole in the skull just above the eye. It is hoped that patients will recover faster than open surgery, in which doctors cut open the skull and have to get past parts of the brain, risking damage. Entering through the eyelid crease, surgeons can follow that cone to just the right spot to access the brain - removing a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside. Entering the socket at a different angle, doctors also can make a cut in the crow's feet at the corner of the eye. Or they can hide an incision in the eyebrow, making a small hole in the skull just above the eye. Dr Robert Harbaugh, president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, cautioned that accessing the brain through the eye, known as a 'transorbital' approach, hasn't been formally studied. So outcomes such as safety cannot be compared to traditional open surgery, which makes a large opening in the skull. Transorbital approaches are worth exploring, he said. But, 'because it's new doesn't mean it's necessarily better.' Dr Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, a John Hopkins University neurosurgeon who co-authored one of the first medical journal reports on the eyelid method a few years ago stressed that this type of surgery is only suitable for carefully selected patients. The tumour cannot be too big; no important nerves can be in the way and the person cannot have too large sinuses as this would mean doctors would not have enough room to get to the brain through the eye. He said the operation's main risk is infection, and added that the procedure can only be done by a specialized team with experience in both the eye and the brain. Dr Tonya Stefko, UPMC's director of orbital and oculoplastic surgery, has the job of protecting the eyeball, making the corridor for the neurosurgeons to work. To access tumours in the hard to reach underside of the brain,  doctors can make a small incision in the eyelid, allowing them to go past the eyeball and access the brain behind the eyes. They remove a bit of bone about the size of two postage stamps from the inside of the eye socket . Those kinds of multidisciplinary teams are rare, limiting wider adoption of these techniques, said Dr Quinones-Hinojosa. 'You really have to learn how to be co-captains. Medicine and surgery hasn't been, traditionally, like that,' he said. Pamela Scott believes patients should be informed about alternative options like the eyelid approach – rather than being told open surgery is their only option. She knew medical centers often offer second-opinion consultations for long-distance patients, and started hunting — aided when her husband used a 3D printer to create a life-size model of her skull with her tumor for surgeons to examine. 'The sad thing is that people don't know there are other options than what their small-town doctor is telling them,' she said. 'I feel like a walking miracle.' She had to travel 2,580 miles from her home in California to Pittsburgh for the procedure. But after having the operation, she awoke with essentially a black eye, and was back at work in her psychotherapy practice in two weeks, wearing sunglasses. Doctors warn the surgery, known as transoptical surgery, is not suitable for everyone and should be carried out by specialist teams of brain and eye specialists . In Indianapolis, dentist Deborah Boyer underwent a similar months-long search to treat a meningioma growing around critical nerves and blood vessels, threatening her vision and motor function. She wanted both a brain and an eye specialist. So she read medical journals online and hunted designated 'centers of excellence.' Dr Gardner initially planned to cut through the side of her skull, a smaller operation than other doctors offered, but later decided the corner of her eye offered a good path. Ms Boyer said it took twice as long as regular surgery, but she was discharged in four days pain-free. 'People need help to try to get connected more quickly, and to know what those options are,' she said.",

        "document": "She is barely out of university, but a bright young inventor has come up with an idea that could spell the end of use-by dates on food. Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off. The sticker, which contains gelatine, starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays. How it works: The sticker, which contains gelatine, starts off smooth but over time develops bumps as the gelatine decays. A smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin . A smooth label means the food is good to eat and a lumpy label shows it should go in the bin – meaning someone can tell simply with a swipe of a finger whether their food is out of date. Miss Pakstaite, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said: ‘I wanted to create a label that would change its texture over time to model the decay process of food and drink. ‘Why gelatine? Because it is a protein, so it decays at the same rate as protein-based foods like pork, milk and cheese. ‘And the gelatine can be adapted to match the expiry period of the food by altering the concentration. ‘So, the higher the concentration, the longer the gel will stay solid. The label simply copies what the food in the package is doing, so the expiry information is going to be far more accurate than a printed date.’ Inventor: University graduate Solveiga Pakstaite, 22, pictured, has developed a label that changes texture as the food inside the packet goes off . The graduate, whose Lithuanian parents are computer scientists, has applied for a patent for her idea and is talking to several firms about developing it commercially. If it is taken up, it could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use-by dates. Seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in Britain, costing around £480 per family. Miss Pakstaite, who finished her degree in design and technology at Brunel University in London this summer, said her inspiration for the Bump Mark label came after working with blind people during her course. ‘I wanted to create a solution for enabling visually impaired consumers to gain expiry information about their food, as currently the only indication is a printed date,’ she said. ‘From the start, I knew that the solution must appeal to sighted people also, because the sad reality is that new solutions only get implemented by companies if the benefits are useful to the majority. ‘This is why I worked to create a cheap solution that could be applied to existing food packages and also provides information that even sighted people haven’t had access to before: information about the actual condition of food.’ Miss Pakstaite is today announced as the British winner of the James Dyson Award for product design, winning £2,000 in prize money. She will now be entered into Dyson’s international contest. The label’s design went through more than 20 versions before it was submitted to the Dyson judges. Answer? The Bump Mark label could help to solve the vast waste problem created by inaccurate use-by dates. Seven million tons of food are thrown away every year in Britain, costing around £480 per family . Last year a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers blamed use-by dates for the waste of edible food. It found up to half the food we buy in supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible. The report said: ‘There is confusion over labelling and sell-by dates, with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food.’",

        "document": "Almost one in seven Australians are living below the poverty line and now the Australian Council of Social Service fear that federal budget measures will make it worse. ACOSS has released a report revealing poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.5 million people, or 13.9 per cent, living below the internationally accepted poverty line. It also found 603,000, or 17.7 per cent, of all children are living in poverty. Almost one in seven Australians are living below the poverty line . The social problem is particularly stark in NSW, which has the highest proportion of people facing hardship with some 868,373 people living below the poverty line. 'This is alarming and highlights the need for a national plan to tackle the scourge of poverty which diminishes us all in one of the wealthiest countries in the world,' ACOSS CEO Cassandra Goldie said on Sunday. 'This finding brings into focus the sheer inadequacy of these allowance payments, which fall well below the poverty line.' Dr Goldie said there were two critical ways government policy could alleviate poverty: housing and basic income support. 'Thirty-six dollars a day is not enough security - there is a real risk of poverty while struggling on the Newstart allowance,' Dr Goldie said. The poverty line for a single adult is $400 per week yet the maximum rate of payment for a single person on Newstart is $501 a fortnight. The report found those most likely to be living in poverty are people who are unemployed . ACOSS has released a report revealing poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.5 million people, or 13.9 per cent, living below the internationally accepted poverty line . When Rent Assistance and other supplementary payments are added, it's only $303 per week. That's $97 per week below the median income poverty line. The report found those most likely to be living in poverty are people who are unemployed (61.2 per cent) and those in households that rely on social security as the main source of income (40.1 per cent), particularly on Newstart. Dr Goldie said the report emphasised dangers in the federal budget, including plans to reduce indexation of pension payments. '(This) is likely to result in higher poverty rates over time,' she said. 'These overall findings are a wake-up call for us as a community and shine a spotlight on the current policy direction of the federal government. 'It provides an opportunity for the government to work with the whole community to reconfigure its first budget and national policy priorities around the urgent need to address poverty in Australia.' Meanwhile, the Governor-General Peter Cosgrove has called on his fellow country men and women to help Australians plagued by the \"insidious and all encompassing\" problem of poverty. Sir Peter said the problem of poverty did not discriminate. He told the launch of Anti-Poverty Week in Sydney poverty was insidious and all encompassing because it deprived people of a choice. 'It deprives them of their freedom and assaults their dignity. As a nation we can't allow it to continue,' he said on Sunday. The Australian Council of Social Service fear that federal budget measures will make it worse . The risk of poverty is greater outside capital cities in most states and territories (especially in Queensland and Tasmania), in part due to higher unemployment in regional Australia, the report says. The exceptions are NSW and Western Australia, where very high housing costs in the capital cities have increased the risk of poverty. Anti-Poverty Week chair Julian Disney said there was many areas of disadvantage, not just lack of income, including disability and mental health. He stressed the need to provide some vulnerable people with deep, life-long support. 'We ...shouldn't fool ourselves that just giving them some money and education and patting them on the back will be sufficient,' he said. 'Many of the disadvantages are much deeper than that.\" Salvation Army Moneycare financial counsellor Lisa Ross said it doesn't take much for someone to suddenly find themselves below the poverty line. 'All within a month, people can (suddenly) face poverty,' Ms Ross said.",

Scrappy, an eight-month-old Labrador-Chow mix, was apparently put down at Bakersfield animal shelter after he was filmed attacking his young neighbor Jeremy Triantafilo. Jeremy's life was saved when his pet cat Tara selflessly pounced on the dog as it launched its attack, chasing the vicious animal down the street so her best friend could receive emergency medical help. Scroll down for video . Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when Scrappy the dog escaped and ran towards him. The Labrador-Chow mix has since been destroyed at nearby at Bakersfield animal shelter . To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment . Scrappy was destroyed after he continued to display aggressive traits during a 10-day assessment period at Bakersfield animal centre, according to TMZ. He bit two staff during his stay, and tried to attack any employee who brought him food and water. Last Wednesday, surveillance footage emerged showing Tara the cat saving Jeremy by pouncing on the dog as it attacked him. Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She . followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years . ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo . said. 'That dog did not even know what hit him.' Feline brave: The cat launches herself at the startled dog and knocks it away from Jeremy . And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy . Erica . explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the . neighbor's dog, Scrappy, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd . never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat . flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.' After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side. In . an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, his family said she had . always been protective over their oldest child and slept in his crib . when he was a baby. They also have younger twin boys. They . added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed . them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, . even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They . named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond . Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means . driftwood. 'We named her . driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it. Loved: The cat happily lets the little boy kiss her as he calls her a hero who saved him from a 'mean dog' Feline fine: Hero cat Tara, with the help of her owner Roger Triantafilo and team staff member Jade Henry (right), 'tosses' the first pitch at the start of the Bakersfield Blaze and Lancaster Jayhawks game . The video had shown Jeremy sitting on . his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when the dog escaped . its home through an open gate and crept up on him from behind. Surveillance . footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog . grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently . shaking him with his teeth clamped tight. Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara. The . video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to . push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the . driveway with its leg between its tail. Jeremy, who has mild autism, needed stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine. 'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He tells us it feels better.' Claw blimey: Tara, with her owner Roger Triantafilo, leaves with Jeremy (left) and Erica (centre) Last week Tara was the star attraction at a minor league baseball match at Sam Lynn Ballpark in Bakersfield, California, 'throwing' the first pitch at the Bakersfield Blaze game. She was carried onto the pitch by Roger Triantafilo, accompanied by his son, Jeremy, who she saved from the dog attack, and his wife, Erica. Tara, however, didn’t quite play ball. Organisers had provided a baseball attached to a piece of string for the ceremonial first pitch, but she wasn’t very interested in swatting it. In the end Mr Triantafilo gave her a helping hand and moved her paw through the air as he pitched the baseball. The crowd were ecstatic nonetheless.",

Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control. And each week, diabetes leads to a staggering 268 heart attacks, 325 strokes, 143 cases of kidney failure and 385 early deaths, according to other figures in the report. Scroll down to watch video . Officials say GPs are not monitoring patients with diabetes properly or giving them vital advice on how to keep their condition under control, leading to 120 amputations being carried out every week . The number of Britons with the condition has doubled in 20 years mainly due to obesity, causing an increase in people developing type 2 diabetes, and today it affects 3.8million. One in seven patients in hospital has the illness, and it costs the NHS £14billion a year. Nearly 90 per cent of patients with the condition have type 2 diabetes, which is usually caused by obesity. Yet the report by Public Health England warns that GP surgeries are not doing enough to help combat the condition. On average, just 36 per cent of diabetes patients are keeping their blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol at safe levels. All of this can be regulated by insulin injections, other medication or through simple lifestyle advice on weight loss, diet and exercise. But in some areas – including  West Suffolk – the proportion of patients who have their diabetes under control falls to 28 per cent. The number of Britons with the condition has doubled in 20 years due to obesity, and today it affects 3.8million . John Newton of Public Health England, the agency responsible for tackling health issues such as diabetes, said: ‘We need to create a sense of urgency in dealing with these future health problems which are facing our communities. Some practices are achieving good control but there is too much variation. ‘Practices are not being systematic enough about bringing patients in regularly and recording what investigations they’ve had done.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We know that diabetes can have a devastating impact on people and we want everybody to get excellent care and support, regardless of where they live.’ They do not produce enough insulin and this causes their blood sugar to rise, leading to nerve damage. This can result in foot sores and amputations, blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes. The report shows that last year diabetes led to 6,298 amputations, 13,947 heart attacks, 16,910 strokes and 7,447 patients needing kidney dialysis or transplant. Barbara Young, chief executive of charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘This is just the latest in a long line of statistics that show that diabetes healthcare is hugely geographically variable and in many places is not good enough. ‘The public deserve more than politicians and NHS leaders wringing their hands about it but then failing to do anything meaningful to try to fix it.’ Martin McShane, of NHS England, which runs the health service, said: ‘A healthy lifestyle in adults at high risk of diabetes can halve the likelihood of suffering from the condition, but there is also a need for NHS England to support evidence-based treatment shaped to support individuals.’",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Hail stones the size of fists pummel the small sailboat lurching violently in the Pacific Ocean. Blanketed in darkness, Nik Brbora desperately tries to steer his 18-strong crew through 50-knot hurricane winds and waves three-storeys high. As dawn approaches, a monster wave flips the yacht, ripping out the steering and smashing Brbora against the deck. Falling in and out of consciousness, the 29-year-old is rescued by U.S. coast guards who take him to the closest hospital -- 900 kilometers away in San Francisco. It's a terrifying and ultimately death-defying moment for the IT engineer from London. Yet now, as he looks back three months after completing the year-long Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, Brbora says the journey was also the greatest experience of his life. He was one of 500 amateur sailors racing ten yachts 64,500 kilometers across the globe, battling everything from hurricanes in the Caribbean to the dreaded doldrums of South East Asia. It may seem like the sort of grand adventure only the most hardened sailor would be capable of. But in an unusual twist, the majority of people on board have never sailed a boat in their lives. The event organizers are now recruiting for next year's clipper race. Those who enter face the prospect of saying goodbye to their jobs, family and friends for a 12-month voyage on the high seas. Setting sail in July 2013 from Southampton in the UK, the 70-ft yachts will visit 15 ports on all six continents. The journey is made up of eight legs, with sailors able to join for one of these, or the full circumnavigation. Founded in 1996 by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston -- the first person to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in 1969 -- the Clipper Race revolves around the notion anyone can circumnavigate the globe, regardless of their experience. The only selection criteria is people must be over 18, pass a three-week sailing course and be physically fit enough to complete the epic voyage. At Â£43,000 ($69,000) per person for a full year-long voyage, it's not simply a huge physical undertaking, but a significant financial one. \"A lot of people thought I was crazy. They said: 'You could be using that money to put a deposit on a house or a luxury holiday around the world,'\" said Brbora. \"But they're such boring, standard options. I saw this as a personal investment.\" Australian Lisa Blair, who also completed the full circumnavigation on a different yacht, raised part of the money for her trip through a sponsored 1,300 kilometer cycle ride from Sydney to the Sunshine Coast. After being selected from almost 800 applicants, the 27-year-old novice sailor quit her retail assistant job, packed up her house and moved to Britain for an intensive sailing course. Within months she was bunking down with 17 other strangers in a clipper headed for their first stop -- Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. \"You're living with guys and girls in an open room with two rows of bunks on either side,\" Blair said. \"Shifts are four hours long, so when you're up on deck you're steering the boat, dealing with rigging, making repairs. By the time you get into bed you might only have two hours sleep,\" she added. With limited access to phones and internet, the crew is essentially cut off from the outside world. \"We only heard about the volcanic ash which shut down airports in Mexico because we were sailing past it,\" added Blair. \"Instead, you learn a lot about the people on board -- it's human interaction on a really deep level,\" she said. Throughout last year's race, participants ranged from 18 to 73-years-old, hailing from 40 countries across the world. They included a NASA scientist, ballet teacher, TV weather girl, farmer, undertaker and London cabbie driver. For Brbora, the biggest challenge came just two months before the end of the race when his vessel was almost destroyed in a storm 900 kilometer off the coast of San Francisco. Brbora was flung against metal railing in the accident, suffering a strained hip, while fellow crew member Jane Hitchens, 50, also from Britain, broke her ribs. \"The deck looked like a warzone. There was no steering left and everyone's life jackets had popped open,\" Brbora said. \"I had a sharp pain in my hip -- I thought 'this is what it must feel like to be hit by a car.' They initially tried to airlift me and Jane out with a helicopter but it was too dangerous with the mast swinging about.\" The boat, still miraculously in one piece, was repaired in San Francisco, and the crew went on to finish sixth in a field of 10. But along with the challenges came moments of joy. \"You might be sitting up on deck and hear this whistling sound and it's a pod of dolphins or whales or giant sea turtles,\" Brbora said. For self-confessed \"ballsy\" sailor Blair, her favorite memory was of gliding down waves the size of four-storey buildings in the Southern Ocean. \"It's agony because it's so cold; around 3 degrees Celsius (37 Farenheit). But here you are surfing down the face of these mountains of water,\" she reminisced. The clipper race was a life-changing adventure for both Blair and Brbora. After all, why stress about a late train or rainy weather when you've survived the most brutal waves on the planet? \"Not many people can say they've sailed around the world,\" Brbora said. \"It's made me realize you shouldn't be afraid of things and it's definitely given me more confidence.\" Blair, whose boat won the race, now teaches sailing professionally and hopes to again sail around the world -- this time on her own. \"I've started living my life by the quote: 'Just do, because the world is changed by doers,'\" she said. \"You're not going to change the world by sitting on the couch watching TV.\"",

        "document": "Aleksey Vayner, the very determined Yale student with the infamous video resume, died this weekend, according to reports . The Yale student who catapulted to Internet infamy with a disastrous video resume he sent to a prospective employer has reportedly died at his home in Queens, New York after a friend sent him desperate messages on Facebook asking him to 'pick up the phone' and think of his mother. Aleksey Vayner passed away at the age of 29, according to the New York City Medical Examiner -  and reports from relatives suggest that he may have experienced a drug overdose. On Jan. 18, the night before his death, a friend wrote on Vayner's Facebook wall, 'Do not, anyone, sell this idiot ANY pills!.' This rest of the post is written in Russian and says, 'Damned egoist, pick up the phone, who's going to take care of mom? [you could] sell your source code and f**k off to costa rica. [even] paypal would pay you 2-3 hundred thousand. pick up the phone, bastard.' In response, just before midnight, Vayner angrily wrote back to his Facebook friend by responding 'Volodia, go to hell' in Cyrillic. A spokesman for the medical examiner told Ivygate that a man matching Vayner's description under the name of Alex Stone died at 8 a.m. on January 19th at Jamaica Hospital, Queens. She said the cause of death was still to be determined and the autopsy will take several weeks. 'It looks like he took some drugs or medicine, had a heart attack, a friend of his drove him to the hospital, and they couldn't resuscitate him,' said Boris Vayner, who identified himself as Aleksey's step-cousin to Gawker.com . 'Not exactly sure though, I'm too far away.' Public records seen by the MailOnline confirm that Vayner had changed his name in April 2012. It is believed that he decided to go under the name of Alex Stone after the video resume he sent to UBS for an investment banking job in 2006 went viral online and was mocked by millions. In the video, titled 'Impossible is Nothing,' a gravely serious Vayner attempts to prove his mental and physical fitness by talking about the meaning of success while lifting 495-pound weights, smacking tennis balls faster than 140 miles per hour, ball-dancing with a scantily-clad woman and breaking seven bricks with his hand. 'Ignore the losers, bring your A-game, your determination and your drive to the field, and the success will follow you,' he says in the video. The video was forwarded around Wall Street and quickly went viral. The Facebook posting to Aleksey's page the evening before his death that begins with a warning in English and carries on in Russian to ask him 'who's going to take care of your mom?' Vayner said his physical fitness was a testament to his mental stamina . The New York Times called it 'The Resume Mocked 'Round the World,' and Vayner told the newspaper that he thought he might never get a job in the financial industry as a result of the video's popularity. While the video became the laughing stock of Wall Street, Vayner said he was not amused. 'He said he feels like a victim,' the Times reported in October 2006, three months after the video was recorded. 'The job materials that were leaked and posted for public view included detailed information about him that allowed strangers to scrutinize and harass him, he said.' Even before he arrived as a freshman at Yale, Vayner had become known for exaggerating his own feats. At a 2002 event in New Haven for high-school seniors who have been admitted to Yale, Vayner told current students all about his abilities and specialised skills. He told Jordan Bassm a freshman student at the Ivy League college that he had taught tennis to Jerry Seinfeld and Harrison Ford and that the Dalai Lama had apparently written his college recommendation. Vayner included clips of himself skiing and chopping bricks in half with his palm . Vayner shows off his tennis skills in the video that he sent to UBS for an investment banking job . 'He talked for, like, six hours straight the first night,' said Bass to the New Yorker magazine after they investigated Vayner in 2006 following his notorious video job application. 'He had a lot of affiliations with élite institutions. He was an action star, an espionage expert, and a professional athlete. He would be on the C.I.A. firing range one day and, the next, at a martial-arts competition that took place in this secret system of tunnels underneath Woodstock, New York. 'Then he was at a skiing competition in Switzerland. He told us the Russian Mafia had him forging passports.' Struck by the outlandish claims of the prospective student, student journalist Bass investigated and eventually wrote a title for the Yale campus tabloid entitled 'CRAAZY PREFROSH LIES, IS JUST WEIRD'. Attending Yale despite the attention of the article, Vayner arrived with a CV that now boasted he had begun modelling for the price of $200 an hour, written a book about the Holocaust and founded a charity for troubled children. He also claimed to have won two tennis matches against Pete Sampras, retired from professional martial arts and mastered the art of 'bone setting'. Aleksey Vayner with an unidentified woman who is believed to be his wife . As an undergraduate at Yale - Aleksey made outlandish claims about his social and academic prowess that he included in his now notorious Impossible is Nothing video résumé . These amazing claims informed part of Vayner's video résumé which he sent to UBS and included the further claims that he was a an international rumba dancing specialist and could split a stack of bricks with his bare hands. Today, Vayner is listed online as the manager of a company called Ultimate Success Systems, LLC, and a nonprofit called Empower a Child.' It has also been reported that Vayner may have been married at some point. He has maintained a YouTube channel where he posts videos of himself performing athletic feats, such as punching through a block of wood and cracking bricks with his palm. In an interview from 2010 with motherboard.vice.com, Vayner described how the spread of his video had . made him feel 'like that Star Wars Kid' - referring to Ghyslain Raza, . the Canadian boy who had to seek therapy after a secret video of him playing . with a mock light sabre turned him into a laughing stock. 'I hit rock bottom.' The videoed interview took place at ROFLCon . during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, . martial arts, tennis and Buddhism. Aleksey Vayner at ROFLCon during which he outlined his continuing passion for weight lifting, martial arts, tennis and Buddhism . The news of Vayner's passing was first announced in an email to a group of his friends from Yale - which has been seen by the MailOnline. According to the email, his sister, Tamara and mother, also called Tamara are devastated by the news and are planning a memorial service for January 26th in New York. The author of the email recounted how when he last saw Vayner in December, he was applying to law school, coaching tennis, in good spirits and looking forward to the future. In his cover letter to UBS, Vayner said 'as a world-level athlete in several sports, I have developed an insatiable appetite for peak performance and continuous learning.' On his resume, Vayner cited  experience as an investment adviser at a firm called Vayner Capital Management. He also claimed he did charity work at an organization called Youth Empowerment Strategies. The websites for both of the companies went dark shortly after his video resume went viral, however, and there was no evidence that either of the organizations was legitimate. Arriving in New York from Uzbekistan with his mother at a young age, Vayner had recently started his own company and was trying to recover from the debacle his video resume had caused him. UBS’sreputation as one of the top investment management firms in the world motivates me to consider a career with your firm. The fast-paced environment and focus on results and excellence that define UBS would be an ideal place for me in terms of both personality and skills. I strive in intense, competitive environments. As a world-level athlete in several sports, I have developed an insatiable appetite for peak performance and continuous learning. My trainer and world martial arts champion often said, “Impossible is just someone’s opinion.” I live by those words. My unique mix of previous work experience and my record as a professional athlete demonstrate a level of focus, a pattern of setting and achieving objectives, as well as adaptation to change. I live everyday with passion because I embrace change as a daily challenge. Nothing will prevail over genuine human relations because we succeed as a team, or we fail as individuals. The skills outlined on my attached resume, along with my work experience, CFP and RIA certifications demonstrate my aptitude in finance. These skills and the personal qualities and beliefs I bring to my work fit well with UBS work ethic and make me an ideal candidate for a career with UBS. I would welcome the occasion to further discuss career opportunities with UBS, and Iook forward to hearing from you soon.

Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids. Researchers at Yale University found pro athletes promoted 44 different food or beverage brands during 2010, with 79 percent of those food products being 'energy-dense and nutrient-poor.' In the drinks market, 93 per cent of the drinks the mega stars put their names to - including sports drinks - received all of their calories from added sugar, authors found. Scroll down for video . Bad role models: Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James, pictured, and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids . But the worst culprits were the most famous athletes, a fact that saddened health experts. Denver Broncos signal caller, Peyton Manning, has endorsement deals with Papa John's pizza and Oreo cookies, adding to the $12 million he makes annually from lending his face, voice and persuasive powers brands. According to Forbes, he even owns 21 Papa John's stores in the Denver area. Meanwhile, Miami Heat champion LeBron James earns $42 million per year by endorsing McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other products and number 3 on the researchers' list of stars who plug unhealthy products is tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who in the past has done ads for McDonald's and Oreo cookies. Pizza: Denver Broncos star Peyton Manning, left, stars in ads for Papa John's pizza and even owns a number of stores . Many of those food-and-beverage sales campaigns are aimed at young consumers, the study, which was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, found. 'When taking into account the nutrient quality of the products endorsed and the amount of advertising for each product, Peyton Manning, LeBron James, and Serena Williams are the highest contributors to the marketing of unhealthy foods,' the paper concluded. The authors said it 'ironic' that 'some of the world's most physically fit and well-known athletes' were promoting the unhealthy food and drinks and said it sends 'mixed messages about diet and health.' Unhealthy: Serena Williams, pictured, appears in an ad for Oreos licking the cream center . The study compared the modern day junk food flogging to the cigarette ads of sports stars like Babe Ruth and Ted Williams appeared in. The authors are urging the mega stars to re-think their decisions to push sugar-rich drinks or high-calorie foods. 'Our ultimate hope would be that athletes reject the unhealthy endorsements or, at the very least, promote healthy foods,' Yale University clinical psychology doctoral student and lead author in the study Marie Bragg told NBC News. 'These athletes have an opportunity to work with parents. Instead, they're promoting really unhealthy foods.'",

        "document": "By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 16:38 EST, 7 February 2012 . More than a quarter of American households have just one person living  inside and singles will soon dominate the U.S., according to a new book. Although living in families is a traditional practice almost universal around the world, the book ‘Going Solo’ claims it’s experiencing an effective attack. New York University expert Eric Klinenberg says singles boost economies because they have more disposable income and more time for others. Social patterns; New York University sociology professor Eric Klinenberg, right, claims in 'Going Solo', left, that the U.S. will soon become dominated by singles . But many often lose out because they receive inferior tax breaks and pay more for insurance compared to married people, reported Newsweek. Henry David Thoreau tried living by himself in the mid-1800s, when he was still in his twenties, and the result was his famous book ‘Walden’. The critically-acclaimed work described living alone in the woods. ‘I never found the companion so companionable as solitude,’ Mr Thoreau wrote. One of four siblings himself, he died unmarried, aged 44, and biographers record one proposal to a young woman that was rejected. He built his cottage within walking distance of his family in Concord, Massachusetts, and the pubs he and his friends frequented. By himself: Henry David Thoreau tried living by himself in the mid-1800s, when he was still in his twenties, and the result was his book 'Walden' It was on property owned by his mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Mr Thoreau's mother visited often, bearing home-cooked meals. 'Solitude, once we learn how to use it, does more than restore our personal energy. It also sparks new ideas about how we might better live together' Eric Klinenberg . About 4million Americans were living solo in 1950 and it was up to 31million by 2000, with women outnumbering men 17million to 14million. ‘There are so many different kinds of singles (that) single people have had trouble organising as a political bloc,’ Mr Klinenberg says, reported Newsweek. ‘But there are now so many ... it’s hard not to pay attention to them.’ Between 1950 and 2000, another book appeared in 1962 that may become a landmark - Helen Gurley Brown's ‘Sex and the Single Girl.’ Swedish thinker: Nobel Peace Prize winner Alva Myrdal opened a 'collective house' in the 1930s with 57 units for single women and single mothers . ‘She is engaging because she lives by her wits,’ he quoted her as writing of modern women. ‘She is a giver, not a taker, a winner and not a loser.’ 'There are so many different kinds of that single people have had trouble organising as a political bloc. But there are now so many... it’s hard not to pay attention to them' Eric Klinenberg . Mr Klinenberg also collects interviews with older people who choose independent living rather than available alternatives as long as they can. Most Americans, Europeans and others elsewhere measure life satisfaction in terms of integrity, independence and self-respect, he writes. More than 11million elderly Americans and 72million Europeans live alone. ‘In the coming decades many millions more will do so,’ he writes. Though the book, which has generated much debate, is largely concerned with the U.S. it devotes ten pages to solutions innovated in Sweden. All by myself: About 4million Americans were living solo in 1950 and it was up to 31million by 2000, with women outnumbering men 17million to 14million . The country's Nobel Peace Prize winner Alva Myrdal opened a ‘collective house’ in the 1930s with 57 units for single women and single mothers. 'I never found the companion so companionable as solitude' Henry David Thoreau . The social planner’s innovative home had a communal kitchen, a nursery and small elevator service to each unit for meal deliveries. ‘Solitude, once we learn how to use it, does more than restore our personal energy,’ Mr Klinenberg concludes in his Penguin Press book. ‘It also sparks new ideas about how we might better live together.’",

        "document": "The chilling photographs show how teenagers in Nazi Germany were brainwashed into supporting the fascist cause at Hitler Youth indoctrination camps. The rare images capture the boys marching, standing guard and having their heads shaved in accordance with military rules. They were compiled by a 15-year-old while he carried out his training over the course of eight months in the year before the outbreak of the Second World War. Gathering: A picture of a Hitler Youth 'Landjahr' training camp taken in 1938 by a 15-year-old boy who was taking part . Owner: The photographs were taken by Friedhelm Huhn, whose identity document is shown, when he was attending the camp in 1938 . The photo albums, which were looted by an Allied soldier at the end of the war, are now going up for auction in California. They originated from the 'Landjahr', the rural training camp for boys aged between 15 and 18 who had joined the Hitler Youth. During the war, members were drafted into the German fire service before becoming part of the military reserve and then acted as the last line of the defence of Berlin. Some of the photos show the 'soldiers of tomorrow' in uniform, complete with a Swastika armband and long shorts. They are depicted marching in regimented order with a drill sergeant-type figure walking alongside them. Activities: These photographs show teenagers examining diagrams promoting physical fitness, and having their heads shaved . Discipline: The boys - many of whom would later fight in the Second World War - used to practice marching in military fashion . Memento: Friedhelm apparently kept the photos and his uniform patches, but they were looted by an Allied soldier . Another photo is a group shot of dozens of members stood in a canteen with a giant Swastika flag above their heads. There is a picture of two boys aged about 14 getting their hair shaved short in military fashion, while others show boys studying diagrams about how to improve their physical fitness. The two albums were compiled by Friedhelm Huhn, who carried out his training as a teenager between April and December 1938. It is not known what happened to him during the war, but it is believed the albums were taken as a souvenir by an Allied serviceman at the end of the conflict. The albums - along with Friedhelm Huhn's ID cards and Landjahr uniform patches - are now being sold by auctioneer Nate D. Sanders, which is based in Los Angeles. Playful: But while the pictures may seem charming, the Swastika armbands worn by the teenagers hint at the dark truth . Gathering: One image shows all the participants in the Landjahr standing under a huge swastika flag . Terry Charman, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: 'Although it was never compulsory to join the Hitler Youth, in practice it more or less was. 'Parents really had to send their sons along for training. The Nazis represented it as a German version of the Boy Scouts - which it certainly was not. 'The boys were soldiers of tomorrow and the training had a strong military element to it and involved firearms. 'A lot of the Hitler Youth were drafted in the the anti-aircraft batteries but those who had a reputation for being fairly awesome fighters joined the Waffen SS. Outing: Other images appear to show the Hitler Youth outside the setting of the camp on a visit to a city . Collection: These photo albums are going up for auction in California and are set to fetch £750 . 'In the last days of the war the Hitler Youth was mobilised in the German version of the Home Guard and fought on both eastern and western fronts. A lot of them were sacrificed in Berlin, some as young as 12 or 13. 'The last Nazi newsreel film out of Germany in the war showed Hitler handing out gallantry medals such as the Iron Cross to members of the Hitler Youth for distinguishing themselves in battle.' The albums, which measure 10in by 7.5in, have a pre-sale estimate of £750 and are being sold on February 27. Sinister: A Hitler Youth rally in Berlin in May 1933, soon after Hitler came to power . The Hitler Youth ('Hitlerjugend' in German) were central to the Nazis' plan to create a nation of Aryan 'supermen' by indocrinating children into their twisted racist worldview from the age of 10. The organisation was founded as early as 1922, but it was not until Hitler came to power in 1933 that the group took a prominent position in German society, as it became more or less obligatory for all teenagers to join. Members would be educated in Nazi ideology, and had the genius of Hitler relentlessly drilled into them. Activities such as the Landjahr, where teenagers would spend months working on a farm and practicing military discipline, helped members bond and shored up their belief in the Nazi cause. After the start of the Second World War, the Hitler Youth was transformed into an auxiliary military force, initially attached to unites such as the fire brigade and postal service. Later in the war, with Germany suffering increasingly devastating losses, teenagers began fighting on the front line as part of their own SS division. Hundreds of boys as young as 12 helped form the last line of defence when Berlin was besieged by the Allied forces, and most were killed by the Soviet troops who entered the city. Perhaps the best-known member of the Hitler Youth is Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, who was forced to join the movement but refused to attend meetings due to his family's anti-Nazi views.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- She's got some of the softest hands in the business. But just because jockey Rosie Napravnik has a gentle touch, doesn't mean she's a push over. Quite the opposite. The 25-year-old is a lean, mean, riding machine. And this Saturday she plans on wrapping those tender palms around the most coveted trophy in U.S. horse racing. Could this be the first female to win the Kentucky Derby in the 139-year history of the race? Ahead of the \"Run for the Roses\" -- the first race in the American Triple Crown -- Napravnik remains cautiously optimistic. \"I'm very physically fit. I'm strong. I'm not just a little string bean female that weighs 100 pounds -- and that's why I ride horses,\" she told CNN. \"I think my horse Mylute is going to be a live longshot. He's very laid back, he's not bothered by much, so the crowds shouldn't get to him -- he's definitely the type of horse that you want to have in a race like this.\" Gender game . The young woman from New Jersey isn't just the most successful female jockey in the country -- she's one of the best jockeys full stop. Napravnik is the fifth-highest earning jockey on the circuit today, last year amassing a fortune of more than $12.4 million in prize money. In 2012, her horses finished in the top three in nearly half the races she entered. Not that Napravnik is immune to playing on her gender to help raise her profile in this male-dominated sport. \"For a female jockey it's a little bit harder to get yourself established. But once you can get over that hump and prove that you're a competitive rider, and win races, it's irrelevant what gender you are,\" she said. \"To be honest, the female aspect has worked to my advantage in a lot of respects -- just with publicity and being recognized for things that I've accomplished which may not have been such a big deal if it was just another male jockey.\" Childhood dreams . Napravnik was exposed to horses from a young age -- her father worked as a farrier, while her mother trained event ponies. But it wasn't until she stumbled across an old video of the Triple Crown as a youngster, that she discovered racing. \"I saw this video called the \"Jewels of the Triple Crown\" on VHS -- I didn't have television so I would just watch this video over and over again,\" said Napravnik. \"I was just inspired by it and that's when I decided I wanted to win the Triple Crown.\" At seven-years-old, Napravnik followed her older sister into pony racing -- seen as a training ground for wannabe jockeys. Her sister eventually left the track, but Napravnik pursued her Triple Crown dream and by the time she was 16-years-old was working as an apprentice jockey. \"Learning how to ride when I was so young, learning how to communicate with horses, has given me a great foundation in horsemanship,\" she said. \"It's a stereotype to say that all female riders are finesse riders. A lot are. But there are also men that have that finesse factor as well.\" Dedication . Like many jockeys, Napravnik's rise to the top has gone hand-in-hand with a punishing routine. She's suffered five major accidents and taken a total 15 months off work due to injuries. But the talented young rider shrugs off the risks as just a part of the job. \"I don't think about the danger factor,\" she said. \"It's something I've had a lot of experience in and I try to avoid it as much as I can. A typical day involves waking up at 5am and competing in up to 12 races late into the evening. It's only after her day's work is done, that Napravinik will have a meal, such is the pressure on jockeys to meet strict weight restrictions. Family ties . It can be difficult balancing a grueling career and social life. But once she finishes smashing the record books, Napravnik hopes to pursue another dream -- starting a family. \"There's still a lot of things that I want to accomplish in my career so I'm going to try and get all of that out of the way first -- my husband and I are very excited about having a family.\" But first things first. There's a Kentucky Derby to be won -- and Napravnik might just be the woman to do it.",

        "document": "Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her . Officials at a California adult living facility where a 87-year-odl resident has died after being denied CPR say that the woman who refused to revive the patient was not a nurse. The deceased, identified as Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Glenwood Gardens independent senior living complex in Bakersfield on Tuesday. A staffer who identified herself as a nurse quickly called 911 from her cell phone, but refused to administer CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department. 'Not at this time,' said the woman, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help. Christopher Finn, a spokesman for Brookdale Senior Living, which owns the Glenwood Gardens facility, told the Los Angeles Times that the unnamed caller was 'serving in the capacity of a resident services director, not as a nurse.' Finn would not say if the director was licensed as a nurse. It was later revealed that Ms Bayless . had no Do Not Resuscitate form on file. However, it is against the policy of . the retirement home to give CPR to residents of the independent living complex. The executive director at Glenwood, Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the individual needing attention until such personnel arrives. ‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident.' Unlike nursing homes, independent living facilities like the one where Bayless had lived resemble senior apartment complexes and generally do not provide medical care. According to Toomer, all potential residents are informed about and agree to the facility's policy regarding CPR before they move in. Scroll down for video . Life choice: Ms Bayless's family have now reveal;ed she would not have wanted to be resuscitated . At the beginning of the Tuesday . morning call, the woman asked for paramedics to come and help the 87-year-old who had collapsed in the home's dining room and was barely breathing. Halvorson . pleaded for the caller to perform CPR, and after several refusals she . started asking her to find a resident, or a gardener, or anyone not . employed by the home to get on the phone, take her instructions and . help the woman. NBC affiliate KGET reported that Ms Bayless, a resident of Glenwood Gardens’ independent living facility, collapsed in the dining room Tuesday morning. The staffer previously believed to be a nurse, who identified herself as Colleen, called 911 and was patched to the Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher. The dispatcher begged for her to give the woman CPR, even though it was against her wishes and against the retirement community policy. Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener. The woman refused, saying: ‘I can’t do that.’ Policy: The director for Glenwood Gardens said the woman had signed a DNR form, and that it was against policy to administer CPR in independent living facilities . Obviously frustrated, the dispatcher . said: ‘I don’t understand why you’re not willing to help this patient… I . understand if your boss is telling you you can’t do it. ‘But…as a human being… you know…is there anybody that’s willing to help . this lady and not let her die,’ Halvorson asked. By the time EMT workers arrived on the scene about seven minutes after the 911 call was placed, Ms Bayless had no pulse and was not breathing. She was taken to Mercy Southwest Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her daughter, who is a nurse, later told KGET that she was satisfied with the retirement home’s handling of the incident. First responders said that CPR often does not work on elderly patients, and even if they do survive, many end up suffering from severe health complications. Sgt. Jason Matson, of the Bakersfield Police Department, told Fox News that an investigation into the incident so far had not revealed criminal wrongdoing, but the probe is continuing. Reports of the tragedy have sparked outrage among advocates for the elderly, prompting calls for legislation to prevent this from happening in the future. Asemblywomna Mariko Yamada, chair of the California Assembly Aging and Long-term Care Committee, called Bayless' death a 'wake-up call.'",

IBM developers believe they can successfully assess a person's psychological traits by analysing the 140 characters they use on Twitter. The software scans the most recent tweets, be it hundreds or thousands, to develop a personality profile. Software being developed by IBM to analyse whether a jobseeker is right for a role through their tweets . And developers say this technology, which is being tested, could be used by employers to whittle down the number of applicants for a job interview and could eventually be the deciding factor between two candidates. Researchers believe the software can even establish how emotionally resilient a person is. People are classed as one of the five main personality traits - extroversion, agreeableness, . conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness - depending on what they write. Researchers say they can decipher someone's personality trait by the words they use on Twitter . IBM tested the theory by analysing 300 Twitter profiles and getting the users to take psychometric tests. It showed there was a close correlation between their analysis of the tweets and the results of the tests. According to IBM, the two 'highly correlated' more than 80 per cent of the time. Nigel Guenole, research director of IBM company, Kenexa, told The Sunday Times: 'It could have great potential for spotting future high-flyers'. Researchers claim words used in tweets reveal a person's character traits. According to the research, people who use words like perfect tend to be perfectionists. Those . who are deemed more caring use words like 'we', 'friends' and 'family' and people who were seen as more individualistic used words such as . 'words' or 'school'. Longer words are associated with people . likely to get on with their colleagues and conscientious people talk . about their achievements. Michelle Zhou, from IBM’s Almaden Research Centre in California, which developed the software, told Technology Review: 'We want to use social media to derive information about an individual—what is the overall affect of this person? How resilient is this person emotionally? People with different personalities want something different.' The software could also be used to target adverts to people online, as well as in call centres or other customer service roles. In previous studies researchers have shown that to get a reasonable match for someone's personality they need to assess just 50 tweets. However, the research has prompted warnings of the dangers of relying on social data when selecting a candidate. Susannah Clements, deputy chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told the newspaper hiring people based on their online use 'gives an advantage to people who live and breathe the digital space.'",

        "document": "Southampton climbed to third in the Premier League on Sunday night after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford as Ronald Koeman's side continues to defy the odds in their chase for Champions League football. The Dutchman has rightly taken the plaudits for exceeding all expectations after the club made wholesale in the summer. But who makes up Koeman's backroom staff? Here, Sportsmail gives you the low-down on the men working miracles behind the scenes at St Mary's. Southapton's first team staff (left to right) Sammy Lee, Martin Hunter, Erwin Koeman, Dave Watson, Ronald Koeman and Jan Kluitenberg pose for a picture at the beginning of the season . ERWIN KOEMAN . Role: Assistant manager . Erwin Koeman is the older brother of manager Ronald and the pair teamed up in the summer to take charge of Southampton after managing against each other in the Dutch league. Erwin managed RKC Waalwijk for two seasons - where he locked horns with Ronald, who was manager of Feyenoord - before joining his brother at St Mary's after leading the club to relegation last season. It is the first time the brothers have coached together and Erwin said his late father Martin, who died in 2013, would have been pleased: 'We once said we would be good to work together, but my father also said it would be fantastic if we could be a duo. Unfortunately he won't experience it but I am sure he would really like it.' Erwin, like Ronald, began his playing career at Groningen - the brothers spent one season together at the Dutch side in 1982-83 - before representing PSV and KV Mechelen in Belgium. Erwin also lined up alongside his brother for Holland. The Southampton assistant earned 31 caps for the national side and was part of the team that won the 1988 European Championships. Erwin Koeman is a former manager in the Dutch league and teamed up with brother Ronald at Southampton to coach together for the first time . Erwin and Ronald take their seats for Southampton's Premier League clash with Manchester City in November . JAN KLUITENBERG . Role: First team coach . Jan Kluitenberg followed Koeman to Southampton in the summer after working under him at Feyenoord. The duo also enjoyed spells together at AZ Alkmaar and Benfica. Kluitenberg's role at Southampton is to  ensure the players reach peak physical fitness and is responsible for devising individual training programmes to ensure maximum physical output and prevention of injuries. Having worked with him at three previous clubs, Koeman clearly has trust in Kluitenberg's methods and after Sunday's 1-0 win at Old Trafford, where Saints produced a perfectly executed high pressing performance, it would be hard to argue with his techniques. Jan Kluitenberg has worked with Koeman at three other clubs including Feynoord and AZ Alkmaar . SAMMY LEE . Role: First team assistant coach . Sammy Lee spent 12 years as a Liverpool player in the 1970s and 80s winning three consecutive league titles and three European Cups during a golden era for the club. Lee began his coaching career at the Merseyside club, too, where he spent another 11 years at Liverpool working under Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier before moving on after the appointment of Rafa Benitez. Lee then moved to Bolton and became Sam Allardyce's assistant - where he was affectionately known as 'Little Sam' - and even enjoyed a short spell in charge of the north-west club. The 58-year-old also coached England for five years during Sven-Goran Eriksson's reign between 2001 and 2006, before further spells at Liverpool and Bolton. Lee left his role as head of academy coaching at Wanderers to link up with Koeman at Southampton, with the club hoping to tap into more than 20 years of coaching experience. Sammy Lee won three league titles and three European Cups as a player at Liverpool . MARTIN HUNTER . Role: Technical director: . Martin Hunter began his career as a PE and Geography teacher at Bridgewater Hall School in Milton Keynes, before working as assistant manager at Bradford and Stoke. Hunter then spent 13 years as a coach at the FA, where he worked with England Under 15s, Under 16s and Under 19s and helped bring through the likes of Joe Cole, Theo Walcott and Michael Carrick into the senior team. Hunter went on to work at Norwich and Watford - where he played an active role alongside Malky Mackay - before returning to Bradford for a short spell in 2010. He then moved to Southampton in July 2010 as under 21 coach before moving into his role as technical director, where he has played a key role in bringing through players from the youth academy. In a recent interview with the Telegraph Hunter described the 'Southampton way': 'We tell the coaches we want three things in the session: we want players coming off sweating with a smile on their faces and to have learned something.' Assistant first team coach Lee issues instructions from the touchline . DAVE WATSON . Role: Senior goalkeeping coach . Dave Watson made more than 200 appearances for his hometown club Barnsley before his playing career was curtailed by a serious knee injury that he wasn't able to recover from. Watson hung up his gloves in 2001 at just 28 before embarking on a coaching career that began at Northampton and took him to Oldham and Huddersfield. Watson then worked with the England Under 19s, where he enhanced his reputation after assisting in the development of Joe Hart, Ben Foster and Jack Butland at international level. His work didn't go unnoticed ans Watson was invited by senior manager Roy Hodgson to work alongside Ray Clemence at Euro 2012, before taking up a role at Norwich. Leaving Norwich after their  relegation to the Championship last season, Watson joined the staff at Southampton and has helped Fraser Forster make the seamless transition to Premier League football. Goalkeeping coach Dave Watson and Koeman get their point across to the players . PS LES REED . Role: Executive director . Les Reed began his career as a coach in non-League before spending time coaching in the FA becoming director of technical development, overseeing the development of Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Reed is most famous for a disastrous spell in charge of Charlton Athletic after taking over from Iain Dowie in November, 2006. Reed lasted in the job just six weeks, managing one victory and suffered the embarrassment of being knocked out of the League Cup by League Two side Wycombe. The ill-fated reign led to Reed being attacked in the media and he developed the unwanted nickname 'Les Miserables'. He left by mutual consent in December. Reed joined Southampton in 2010 as head of football development and was in charge of overseeing the youth academy, scouting and recruitment, sports medicine and science, and kit and equipment management.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- After age 60, we are all likely passengers on the Alzheimer's Express. These days it's overcrowded with baby boomers and is predicted by 2050 to claim 115 million victims worldwide, including 13.5 million Americans (up from 5.1 million today), bankrupting our health care system. That will happen, says a recent Alzheimer's Association report, unless we slow down this terrible disease. The good news is: Most of us can. It's true that pharmaceutical drugs have failed miserably to stop or reverse the disease. A cure is not on the immediate horizon. \"Maybe not for 100 years, or ever,\" says Dr. Jack C. de la Torre, a prominent Alzheimer's researcher at the National Institutes of Health-funded Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Arizona. \"The answer,\" he says, as do thousands of other Alzheimer's researchers, \"is prevention,\" the same strategy we use against other chronic diseases of aging, such as heart disease. The evidence that we can cut our risk of Alzheimer's is compelling and mounting constantly. It is true that your vulnerability to Alzheimer's and other dementias is definitely influenced by your genes. Early onset Alzheimer's, before age 60, is caused by genetic mutations and is thus quite strongly inherited. But in late-onset Alzheimer's, which appears after age 60 and accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases, genes are not destiny; they simply make us more susceptible. I have the major \"susceptibility gene\" known as ApoE4, that triples my risk of developing Alzheimer's in late life. Seventy-seven million other Americans (25 percent of the population) also carry it. But Alzheimer's is more of a personal and public health choice than most people realize, as shown by thousands of scientific papers on the subject. \"A lot of Alzheimer's is about lifestyle -- what you do and even who you are, your personality,\" says prominent Alzheimer's researcher Robert Wilson at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center. Effective deterrents to Alzheimer's, according to Wilson: a higher education, staying mentally active, eating the right foods, exercising, muscle-building and being conscientious, easy-going and an extrovert. Much research ties Alzheimer's to the same lifestyle factors that cause heart attacks and strokes: high cholesterol, blood pressure, high blood sugar, insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. \"Taking care of your heart protects your brain,\" says De la Torre. He urges preventing Alzheimer's by screening for and treating cardiovascular disease in middle age, years before signs of memory loss and dementia appear. Two other striking ways to ward off Alzheimer's: Stop smoking and avoid heavy drinking, especially binge drinking. Smoking doubles your risk of Alzheimer's, according to a recent University of California, San Francisco analysis. Excessive alcohol brings on Alzheimer's two to three years earlier, UCLA scientists found. Bottom line: Most Alzheimer's, like heart disease and cancer, is a slowly developing chronic disease of aging that takes a decade or more to produce memory loss and dementia. Its progression is accelerated or slowed by diet, personality, lifestyle factors and other health conditions, such as treatable thyroid abnormalities and depression. Thus, we all have many years in which to stall this disease and perhaps outlive its devastating symptoms. If we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by only five years, 1.6 million Americans now expected to get Alzheimer's by 2015, and 6 million by 2050, would be spared, according to the Alzheimer's Association projections. Estimated Medicare savings would be $33 billion in 2020 and $283 billion by midcentury. We can each help save ourselves by intervening as early as possible before the disease seizes our brain and memory loss is irreversible. The older we get, the greater our risk. About half of all people over age 85 have Alzheimer's. Our best hope for defeating the looming global tragedy of Alzheimer's, due to the rapid growth of an aging population, is to keep millions of people from boarding the Alzheimer's Express in the first place, or at least to show them how to jump off before the final destination, which offers no hope of a round-trip ticket. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jean Carper.",

A teacher who arrived at her primary school smelling of alcohol and laughing 'uncontrollably' has been suspended for six months. Catrin Williams stomped around erratically and mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties, the General Teaching Council for Wales professional conduct hearing was told. Teaching assistant Ceri Falshaw said the Year Two teacher turned up late for work with mud on her clothes, which she said was because she had fallen over in her garden. When Miss Falshaw entered the classroom at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, Flintshire, North Wales, at 9.20am, she said Miss Williams smelled of alcohol and mouthwash and was laughing 'loudly and uncontrollably'. Catrin Falshaw was a teacher at Ysgol Yr Esgob, a primary school in Caerwys, North Wales. A hearing heard how the teacher was laughing uncontrollably when she arrived late for work . She stomped over to a wall display and fell into the wall, before using it to prop herself up. Miss Falshaw said Miss Williams 'appeared drunk' and that she mocked the work of a pupil with learning difficulties. Miss Falshaw added this kind of behaviour was 'most unusual' and the children in her class were 'agog' at her behaviour. Presenting officer Lousha Bryl said Miss Williams, of Denbigh, had written a letter in which she denied turning up at the school smelling of alcohol on January 28, 2013. She did not attend the hearing at St David’s Hotel in Ewloe, Flintshire, and was not represented. Professional conduct committee chairman Richard Parry Jones said Miss Williams’ actions 'breached the code of conduct and practice of a registered teacher'. Fellow teaching assistant Hayley Hannah told the hearing she let Miss Williams into the building on the morning of January 28 and could smell an 'overpowering' smell of mouthwash, which she suspected was used to conceal a smell of alcohol. Mrs Hannah expressed her concerns to other teaching assistants, who then informed head teacher Sue Clisham. Mrs Clisham told the hearing that as a result of the events Miss Williams was suspended pending an investigation. The teacher mocked the work of a child with learning disabilities before walking in to a wall and having to prop herself up, a hearing heard (library image) She left a 'lasting smell of alcohol' in the school office when she was called in at 10.45am, Mrs Clisham said. Mrs Clisham added that she did not feel Miss Williams should be in charge of a class or drive herself home. An independent investigation in May found that Miss Williams had presented herself for work smelling of alcohol and attending work while still under the influence, leading to her dismissal for gross misconduct. Williams appealed, but the dismissal was upheld, based on the seriousness of attending work smelling of alcohol. The charge of attending school while still drunk was overturned. After yesterday’s judgment Miss Williams will not be permitted to teach anywhere in Wales for the duration of the six month suspension and must provide the General Teaching Council for Wales with a written assessment from an approved medical professional that she is medically and physically fit to teach after that time. The assessment will specifically assess Miss Williams’ use of alcohol. After the hearing Liz Jenkins, chairman of the school governors, said: 'We note today’s outcome which reaffirms the decision made by the school’s governing body.'",

Despite a lackadaisical attitude towards their health, half of Britons say they are unhappy with their appearance, with most of those blaming a busy lifestyle and lack of money for their unhealthy diet. Unhealthy: Instead of sticking to the so-called 'five-a-day' rule and ensuring they are physically fit, many British adults choose to live on a junk food and sugary drink diet while doing little to burn off the calories . The shocking figures were revealed in Aviva’s Health Check UK report, which was released today. The study found that one in three 25 to 34-year-olds were officially overweight, with that figure rising to 50 per cent of all 35 to 44-year-olds. That figure improves slightly in the over-55 age range, where only a quarter are overweight. Despite a rising level of concern surrounding obesity in Britain, a third of those who fall into the category insist they were happy with their weight and feel fine physically. The lack of interest in taking care of . ones health stems from people prioritising their work and social life . over exercise and a good diet, according to Aviva UK Health medical . director Dr Doug Wright. 'The nation is falling woefully short of . hitting the five-a-day target of fruit and ­veg and too many people are . failing to fit proper exercise into their lives,' he told the Mirror. Fitness: While half of Britons admit they cannot be bothered to exercise, the same number say they are unhappy with their appearance . 'It’s about a subtle change in habits like swapping chocolate for an apple... Being ­overweight brings with it the potential for serious health ­conditions, yet people are living in denial by claiming they are in very good health,' he added. 'The risks are well known with ­conditions including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even some types of cancer,' Dr Wright said. Last week it was revealed that super-sized . graves dedicated solely for obese people are set to be installed at a . cemetery amid fears of a growing ‘obesity crisis’. Plans . for 30 super-sized plots - which will be . near the road so undertakers don’t have far to carry the body - have been drawn up by council workers after . larger graves were requested by funeral directors struggling to haul coffins over long distances in Sutton Bridge, .

        "document": "Monday night saw the latest development in Tiger Woods's extraordinary career: the 14-time major winner played caddie to Jimmy Fallon in a chipping contest with Rory McIlroy. The sight of Woods laughing and joking with Fallon and McIlroy on The Tonight Show will stun those used to seeing the steely-eyed, sometimes surly and often foul-mouthed Woods who prowls golf courses. After McIlroy's recent wins at The Open and the US PGA Championship, the Northern Irishman and world No 1 is becoming a true rival to Woods as the biggest name in golf, and the two superstars joined funnyman Fallon to promote Nike's new Vapor irons. All smiles: Rory McIlroy (let) and Tiger Woods (right) on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon . Game on: Fallon challenged McIlroy ro a chipping contest, with Woods playing caddie for the TV host . One-nil: Fallon and McIlroy share a joke after the first pane of glass is shattered . Aim of the game: The pair attempted to break images of each other painted onto glass . Game for a laugh: Woods sat out the competition but joined in the fun and cracked a few jokes . Fallon managed to convince the pair to engage in a game of 'facebreakers', in which the aim was to chip golf balls in order to smash glass windows stained with images of Fallon and McIlroy's faces. The first to smash all the faces of their rival was the winner. Woods, who has suffered a miserable year through injury, culminating in a miserable performance in missing the cut two weeks ago at Valhalla, sat out the competition. All of which was probably wise - who knows what US captain Tom Watson would have made of Woods chipping the ball after the 38-year-old pulled out of the Ryder Cup last week. Instead, a beaming Woods played caddie for Fallon, setting up balls for the TV host to chip. He even cracked a few good jokes: 'Just getting the balls lined up for you, sir,' he obsequiously told Fallon, drawing a laugh from the audience. Fallon couldn't hide his delight at having arguably the greatest golfer in history as his caddie. But, as McIlroy took charge of the contest, Fallon screamed: 'Tiger, help me!' But the four-time major winner took the trophy. Meanwhile, Woods revealed he pulled out of the Ryder Cup because he did not feel he could have won a point for the United States. Woods withdrew himself from contention for the competition, which gets under way at Gleneagles in Scotland on September 23, and has ruled himself out of any further action until December as he attempts to get to the root cause of persistent back problems. 'Physically, I couldn't do it,' Woods told Sky Sports News of his decision to inform United States captain Tom Watson he was unavailable. 'I wouldn't be ready, and not being able to be there for my team-mates, the captain, assistant captain and everyone that's involved in the event, I just wouldn't be ready and I just couldn't help the team. 'When your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and I just didn't feel like I could be ready enough to get a point. Year to remember: McIlroy won The Open in July (left) and the US PGA Championship in August (right) Back problems: Woods has endured a miserable year as he battles to overcome serious injury . 'With that being said it was time to shut it down, get stronger, get more explosive again and get back for next year.' The former world No 1 said he is working in the gym and does not plan to pick up a golf club for a month with nothing on his agenda until his own tournament, the World Challenge tournament at Isleworth in Orlando, Florida, in the first week of December. 'I've got to be physically fit when I come back so I'll be explosive again and stable,' he said. 'Obviously this year was frustrating in that I didn't really feel that I gave myself much of a chance. 'I first had that pain in my back and it would go away, and then it would come back, go away, come back, until eventually it never went away... It got fixed, but I took that fall on No 2 at the (WGC-Bridgestone Invitational) and I hadn't done any agility training yet so my hip got misaligned and everything went into spasm again. 'We got that all calmed down again but then I had to play. Now I need to keep it calm, then strengthen it and then I'll be back. That's one of the reasons I've shut it down. I'll come back in December and be ready for next year.' VIDEO Arnie's surgery & Tiger and Rory appear on Fallon .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- I am the mother of three amazing children. Before having children, I was a firm believer that guns were dangerous. But I did nothing to educate myself about guns or gun safety. I feared the unknown and the danger guns seemed to possess. But after 10 years, I now have a gun in my home. Listening to President Obama's news conference on Thursday marking 100 days after Sandy Hook, and the whole gun control debate, prompted me to get my viewpoint across. I married a U.S. Marine. He of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms. This posed no issue until our son was born. I was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home, while he felt quite the opposite. We agreed on one gun locked in a safe, and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents.' Slowly over the years, I became more and more fearful of being home alone on the nights he worked, especially after I had children. We were living in Maryland on a farm in the middle of nowhere. One night, I got a call from my husband telling me to lock all doors and windows as he had just spoken with a sheriff down the road who was looking for an escaped convict. I was terrified. We had that one gun, but I had no idea how to use it. That changed very quickly over the following weeks, as we went out for target practice. I learned how to shoot and for the first time in years, I slept well. I finally felt safe at night. Over the 11 years of our marriage, I slowly learned about guns. I began to accept that the gun itself posed no danger -- any danger was in the hand and heart of the beholder. I learned there were safe ways to teach your children about guns. Guns were a tool like any tool; they have multiple purposes and uses. I learned more about our Constitution and our rights as U. S. citizens. I learned I had nothing to fear and a lot to gain from owning a gun. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? I think mothers need to educate themselves and learn how to best educate their kids. I work with a lot of other mothers, and many of them are shocked that I was taught how to shoot. I understand because I was there at one point -- I was scared of guns. But I no longer fear them. Marine to senator: I won't 'register my weapons' So Mr. Obama and your gun control advocates: I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from raping me or my daughters. I am not physically capable of stopping a 200-pound man from entering my home and doing what he may. However, my gun is very capable of stopping such a criminal if such an act were to occur. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . We live in a society where no one is there to protect us. The police come after the crime, not before. I do not have 24/7 armed protection like you do, Mr. President. Neither do my children. So until you can explain to this nation why your old city of Chicago has rising murder rates by guns, despite some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, I will continue to support the NRA, I will continue to urge others to support the Second Amendment and I will continue to vote for those politicians that support my views. I will also support the notion of placing armed police, veterans, etc. in our schools. Why should your children, Mr. President, be of the select few children in this country who are protected by armed guards? Why are your children more special than mine? Guns on campus: NRA to announce school safety measures . The fact is they are not. All children are special and have the right to be cared for and protected. I am a mom, and I am proud to support the NRA and my right to bear arms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tracy Scarpulla.",

        "document": "By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 12:31 EST, 6 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:28 EST, 6 February 2014 . Tragic: Coporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire in 2011 . Colleagues of a soldier, who hanged herself two years after claiming she had been raped, released a box of live crickets in her room as part of a bullying campaign, an inquest has heard. Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement had 'cried rape'. Cpl Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury on October 9, 2011. Her sister, Sharon Hardy, has told the inquest that she had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision by military investigators not to prosecute the two soldiers who she claimed had raped her in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany. Cpl Berrill said Cpl Ellement had 'desperately' applied to be posted back to the UK after she had been 'bullied' by colleagues in Germany who accused her of 'crying rape'. Cpl Berrill, who became friends with her while they were posted together in Bulford, said that Cpl Ellement would describe how she had been targeted by other female soldiers in her barracks in Germany. She said: 'She had two pet bearded dragons, at one point, shortly after the rape allegation, she left the room to use the bathroom and a box of live crickets had been released in her room and they were everywhere. 'She told me she would get bangs on the door from the girls in the corridor and she said that Charlene (Pritchard) had said she had cried rape.' She continued: 'She said to me that she was no longer her usual bubbly self, she felt she couldn’t trust anybody, she didn’t want to go out anywhere because she felt she didn’t have any friends to go out with. 'She desperately wanted to come back on a compassionate and she was happy when she got that.' Cpl Pritchard denied when she gave evidence to the court that she banged doors or said to Cpl Ellement that she had cried rape. Her colleague Corporal Charlotte Berrill also told the hearing in Salisbury, Wiltshire, that the Army failed to investigate another soldier who acted 'unprofessionally' by telling a colleague that Cpl Ellement (pictured) had 'cried rape' Cpl Berrill told the inquest that she had reprimanded a soldier, Corporal Craig O’Grady, for talking about the rape allegations at Bulford in April 2011. She said: 'I heard him saying she was a bitch and she had ruined his best friend’s life by crying rape. 'I confronted Cpl O’Grady and said that although everyone is entitled to an opinion, it’s not the kind of subject you should be talking about in a police station in front of other people who do not know what happened and you yourself do not know what happened. 'I thought is was highly unprofessional for somebody to talk about something so sensitive to people who had nothing to do with it.' She continued: 'I informed Anne-Marie about what I had heard and told her what Cpl O’Grady said, she was very upset about it and angry, she was clenching her fists a few times, her eyes welled up immediately.' Cpl Berrill said that she was then reprimanded by the regimental sergeant major for informing Cpl Ellement about the comments and relieved of her informal position of junior welfare officer. Tormented: Cpl Berill said Cpl Element (middle) had wanted to be posted back in the UK after suffering from 'bullying' in Germany . She said: 'He said I was professional and did the right thing at that stage by halting the conversation but I was unprofessional and had lost all the respect of my peers because I had told Anne-Marie what had happened.' Cpl Berrill thought 'it was not fair, ' and alleged there was 'no suggestion' the matter would be investigated. 'I knew there wasn’t anyone else she could turn to in the unit, if she lost her trust and confidence in me, she couldn’t talk to anybody,' she said. Cpl Berrill went on to say that Bulford had a 'horrible' working environment. She said: 'It’s not a very nice place, the camp itself is not in a good location, it’s isolated, it has its own weather system which makes it a more miserable place to be. 'As for the company, it wasn’t a nice place to work. Abuse: Other soldiers allegedly banged on Cpl Ellement's door (left) shouting that she had 'cried rape'. Cpl Berrill also claimed Cpl Charlene Pritchard (right) had told colleagues about the rape allegations . 'In my honest opinion, it didn’t feel comfortable, the working environment felt very seniors versus juniors, I didn’t feel like you could mix between the two.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was also singled out by physical training instructors who called her fat. She said: 'In several PT lessons, they would parade the fit people in one section and the unfit people, myself included, in another section. 'I can’t remember the exact words but they would say ‘the fit will be doing this PT, the sick, lame and lazy and the fat, you will be doing this PT’.' She said comments made about Cpl Ellement included: 'She was a bit fat, always downgraded.' 'In PT I heard her being treated differently, I heard the comments at PT.' Cpl Berrill said that Cpl Ellement was downgraded on her physical fitness report and that her ski-ing instructors had given her a 'hard time' on a recent trip. She said: 'I can’t recall exactly, she said to me that they had bullied her and victimised her by picking her out from the group.' Cpl Berrill told the hearing that she had been told of comments made by a superior officer on Facebook who had taken a file of Cpl Ellement’s work home to check it over. The comment, which did not name Cpl Ellement, said: 'I have seen better work from a child.' Family support: Anne Marie Ellement's sisters  Sharon Hardy (left), Khristina Swain (middle) and mother Alexandra Barritt arriving at the hearing . She said that she understood that the officer’s wife, who she believed worked as a primary school teacher, had also posted a comment on Facebook that 'the kids she teaches could do a better job.' Corporal Kareena Brooke told the inquest by phone-link from Diego Garcia that she had an argument with Cpl Ellement in the late spring of 2011 in which she was hit in the face with a bottle, although she was not injured. She said they were friends but they had been 'living in each other’s pockets too much' by the time of the incident as they had rooms facing each other in the barracks at Bulford. She said that they were in a group at a pub in Salisbury playing a game where they made each other’s drinks fizz over. She said that Cpl Ellement accidentally spilled her drink on her dress, which led to the argument in which she was hit with the bottle. Cpl Brooke said she did not know if it had been accidental or deliberate and did not make a formal complaint but did ask to move rooms. She denied that she attempted to turn people against Cpl Ellement following this incident. She said: 'I do not know why I would turn people against her. Me and Anne-Marie, we obviously didn’t get on for a while after this, she had been asking for the guys to lie for her after that night so I wasn’t happy about it. Accusations: Cpl Sarah Noteyoung leaving through the back door of the Coroner's office earlier this week. She is alleged to have vowed to make Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement's life hell after her boyfriend was accused of raping the Royal Military policewoman .

        "document": "About four years ago, Paula Broadwell began her Ph.D. dissertation on Gen. David Petraeus' innovative leadership skills. Some of the interviews were done via e-mail. Others were conducted as Broadwell occasionally ran with the physically fit four-star, including one time with Petraeus and his team along the Potomac River in Washington. Broadwell decided to turn that research into a book and go to Afghanistan after Petraeus was tapped in June 2010 to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top commander in the country. \"We had a relationship before I went there as far as this dissertation was concerned, so it just took it to another level,\" Broadwell told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in February. Petraeus biographer's e-mails led FBI to affair, official says . The relationship between Petraeus and his biographer has become the subject of speculation since he admitted to having an extramarital affair and resigned Friday as CIA director. The affair came to light during an FBI investigation into a complaint that Broadwell was sending harassing e-mails to another woman close to Petraeus, a U.S. official said Saturday. During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official. The official did not identify the woman who made the initial complaint and did not know the nature of her relationship with Petraeus. The FBI interviewed Petraeus in the course of its inquiry, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised. The official did not know whether Broadwell was interviewed. CNN has not been able to reach Broadwell for comment. Her website was not operating Saturday. Broadwell moved with her husband, Scott, to Charlotte, North Carolina, about three years ago, according to the Charlotte Observer. Broadwell, who attended the U.S. Military Academy and served in the Army Reserves after active duty, quickly became a guest on TV news shows after her book, \"All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,\" was published earlier this year. In several appearances on CNN, Broadwell -- with her background in intelligence and counterterrorism -- was asked about U.S. policy in Afghanistan, the Syrian civil war and Iran's use of nuclear technology. She serves as a research associate at Harvard University's Center for Public Leadership. Read the Petraeus letter . Broadwell told Baldwin that she embedded with Petraeus' staff and troops in the field, sharing their hardships and risks. Broadwell spent months in Afghanistan interviewing Petraeus and others for her book, which she wrote with Vernon Loeb. In January, Broadwell told Jon Stewart of \"The Daily Show\" that Petraeus is tenacious, has a will to win and wants to make a difference. \"He loves serving. He loves to be in the arena,\" she said. Just last week, Broadwell published on the Daily Beast a list of Petraeus' 12 rules for living. \"We all will make mistakes,\" read one rule. \"The key is to recognize and admit them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear-view mirrors -- drive on and avoid making them again.\" How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . Broadwell met Petraeus in spring 2006 when he spoke at Harvard, where she was a graduate student, she wrote in the preface to \"All In.\" The author told the general about her research interests and he agreed to put her in touch with people studying the same issues. \"I later discovered that he was famous for this type of mentoring and networking, especially with aspiring soldier-scholars,\" Broadwell wrote. In the preface, Broadwell -- who earned varsity letters in cross-country and track -- said she wanted to see whether Petraeus could match her stride when they ran. \"Instead, it became a test for me.\" Broadwell's passion for physical fitness extended to her appearance earlier this year on \"The Daily Show.\" In an effort to raise money for wounded veterans, she and Stewart engaged in a push-up contest. Stewart and Scott Broadwell faced off against Paula Broadwell. A game, but grimacing, Stewart made it to 38 push-ups. Paula Broadwell, apparently ready to do more, stopped at 60.

        "document": "By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . The guardsman who pirouetted in front of Buckingham Palace was only pulling a harmless prank, his friends said last night. The soldier has been identified as Grenadier Guard Samuel Holmes. He became an internet sensation when he was filmed prancing outside the Queen’s London home while on duty. Tourists cheered the 20-year-old on as he eased the boredom of a two-hour shift by twirling about in his red tunic and bearskin. Scroll down for video . Named: Samuel Holmes (pictured) has been named as the Grenadier Guardsman facing military prison for pirouetting outside Buckingham Palace . His antics have been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. But the Army and Ministry of Defence are furious that he made a mockery of what is supposed to be a solemn duty. Private Dancer, as he has been dubbed, will have to face the music – and could be handed up to 21 days in military prison and a £1,000 fine. A friend said: ‘Sam is a joker – he is always making the other lads laugh. He’s got loads of videos online of him larking about. And he really loves to dance. ‘The strict routines of Army life can get a bit heavy sometimes and Sam enjoys cheering people up. He had no idea how seriously his latest stunt would be taken – and it has worried his family. Posed up: Mr Holmes's Twitter profile picture appears to show him posed up while in uniform . ‘They were so proud of him and would tell anyone who would listen their son is a guardsman. Now he’s getting attention for the wrong reasons. It was a prank and everyone is hoping his bosses don’t make too much of an example out of him.’ Guardsman Holmes, from Derby, showed off some remarkably elegant moves – but soldiers who guard the Queen are trained to be unflinching and expressionless. The three-minute film shows him strutting around and swinging his hips before launching into the series of pirouettes. A child can be heard saying: ‘That’s really silly. Do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman?’ A military source said that senior officers would probably take a dim view, adding: ‘He is there to guard Buckingham Palace, not provide horseplay for tourists.’ The MoD said that it had launched an investigation. His father Marc, who is also thought to have been a Grenadier guardsman, said: ‘It would be unfair to comment given the Army’s charges hanging over him.’ Online sensation: Footage of the 20-year-old soldier performing ballet-style dance moves to the amusement of waiting tourists has seen by more than 2.25 million people since it was uploaded to YouTube last month . Punishment: The soldier is facing having to complete hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex. He also faces losing his wages for the period of his sentence .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- When Command Sgt. Maj. Michael T. Hall of the International Security Assistance Force announced that fast-food offerings like Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen and Orange Julius were being shuttered in Afghanistan, he was blunt about it. \"This is a warzone, not an amusement park,\" he wrote on the ISAF blog. These mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in Kandahar and Bagram, are \"nonessentials\" and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much-needed battlefield supplies. However, according to some soldiers and Marines -- all of whom have served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare isn't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought. The veterans and active-duty troops all said that access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters. The announcement of the fast-food outposts' shuttering inspired a lively debate on CNN's Afghanistan blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm's way. Those affected, however, didn't seem very concerned. \"The big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones,\" Marine Cpl. David Brian Crouch said. Especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet, sour, salty and spicy condiments, such as Tabasco, sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military's frequently derided Meals Ready to Eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities. These high-calorie MREs, which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures, are precisely what Crouch, who served two tours in Iraq, says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful, familiar fast food. Others look a little closer to their temporary home, sampling the local fare. While many soldiers out on combat patrols were, according to Army Capt. David Swaintek, \"too tired and drained to care much about their meal,\" he developed a taste for Iraqi flavors during his tour, which lasted from 2002 to 2008. While he stands up for food on base, calling it \"decent\" and \"healthier\" than fast-food alternatives, he still misses his favorite flatbread, which he'd buy while out on patrol, and he laments not being able to find anything like it stateside. Similarly adventurous, previously deployed Marines now at California's Camp Pendeleton don't have to venture far from their barracks to indulge in the Middle Eastern-style specialties they've come to love. According to the Marine Corps Times, DedeMed's Shawarma House now serves the eponymous gyro-like sandwich -- as well as hummus, tabbouleh salad and baklava -- to Marines who'd been stationed in Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Swaintek, while lauding the indigenous cuisine, also cried foul about fatty U.S. fast foods, saying that \"overweight soldiers are a problem.\" Army Sgt. Paul Williams, who is serving in Iraq, agrees with the captain but indulges in \"the occasional pizza from Pizza Hut, burrito from Taco Bell, or maybe even a sandwich from Subway,\" citing the virtue of being able to enjoy a pizza in the middle of the desert and escape for a few minutes to talk with fellow soldiers about their homes, sweethearts or future plans. Ultimately, though, the military is a culture of intense physical fitness, and access to nutritious meals at mess halls helps servicemen and women maintain their physical and psychological. edge. And Williams says that \"a soldier has a responsibility to maintain himself.\" While deployed troops can certainly take the reins of their physical health, friends and family stateside can still boost morale and offer a taste of home with much-appreciated care packages. The Department of Defense maintains a list of links to groups coordinating care packages for overseas soldiers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, most foods that are tightly prepackaged and immune to mold or bacterial growth are safe for sending to soldiers. They recommend dried proteins, like beef and turkey jerky, as well as dehydrated soups, dried fruits and even dense baked goods like fruitcakes. Just make sure to seal it all up with a kiss.",

        "document": "Women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time, a report will recommend today (file picture) Just 34 women will be tough enough for front line action, it has emerged. It comes as the first female to command an all-male squadron has warned that putting women on the front line could make the army less effective. Major Judith Webb said that women were 'physically different' - even though she believed in 'equality'. Her comments came as a report recommended that women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time. The Ministry of Defence is moving towards the historic change after a six-month review into whether women should be able to serve in infantry and tank regiments. Female fighters could be in combat roles as soon as 2016, senior defence sources have told the Daily Mail. But the review estimates that, on current levels of recruitment, around seven women a year would pass through training to qualify for infantry units and around the same number for the RAF Regiment, according to The Telegraph. About 14 would qualify for the Royal Armoured Corps and only six for the Royal Marines. The review has quashed doubts within the MoD that allowing women to serve in frontline roles would damage the ‘cohesion’ of the armed forces on the battlefield. Military top brass will say there needs to be further research into the ‘physiological demands’ placed on those in close combat roles. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Major Webb, who retired in 1986, said: ‘We had a maximum of four women in my squadron and it was perfectly natural and normal for the guys would do all the heavy jobs and those jobs that were physically demanding while women would do the slightly less physical it was just the normal course of events. ‘When we are talking about an infantry section of eight guys and you’ve got one person who is not actually as physically strong or as physically capable as the other seven over possibly an extended period of time, which is what has not been tested, that could create an effect on our combat effectiveness,’ added major Webb, who was the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the British Army. A senior defence source told the Mail: ‘The review has concluded ministers are minded to approve women in combat roles.’ Last night politicians welcomed the findings, which are due to be published today. Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Defence Select Committee, said: ‘This is a challenging but hugely welcome step forward that will help make our armed forces the very best they can be. 'Keeping our country safe is too important to exclude anyone who can play a role – that means giving women the chance to serve on the frontline in addition to all the other ways in which they are excelling already in the forces.’ But some senior officers fear that repealing the centuries-old rule will lead to a drop in standards in the armed forces. Major General Patrick Cordingley called the change a ‘mistake’. Mr Cordingley, who commanded the Desert Rats during the first Gulf War, told the Mail: ‘There is a political imperative. However, I think that it is a mistake from the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence is moving towards the historic change after a six-month review into whether women should be able to serve in infantry and tank regiments (file picture) 'I can understand why politically it is a good thing to be seen to be doing – on the other hand, the practicalities of women in the infantry and armoured corps are considerable and should not be overlooked. ‘Being in a fighting unit, you need to concentrate on the enemy, you don’t want distractions looking after women, which inevitably you will do. It is a diversion.’ Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, previously said women fighters would harm the ‘warrior ethos’ and damage the fighting capabilities of the soldiers. Women can already find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers. They also serve with distinction as combat pilots. In light of the findings, a senior military source said: ‘There is a real desire among ministers and the military to open up ground combat roles to women. ‘This detailed review is a big step forward in the process, however, it is clear further work needs to be done before a final decision is taken. Labour MP John Woodcock (left) said allowing women into infantry and tank regiments 'a challenging but hugely welcome step forward', but Major General Patrick Cordingley (right) called the change a 'mistake' ‘The wellbeing of all our personnel is of the utmost importance, but there is genuine hope this will be a reality come 2016.’ If the plans go ahead, women on the frontline will be subject to the same physical tests as men. It is understood only a small minority of the 16,000 women serving in the armed forces would want to or be capable of passing the tests. The next research programme is expected to deliver a report in 2016, which will inform a final decision on whether the exclusion can be safely lifted. Britain is behind the times on the matter compared to other countries. Of the 28 members of Nato, just two others, Turkey and Slovakia, still bar women from combat roles. The US lifted its ban last year, joining countries including Germany, Canada, France and Israel. As part of the UK review, thousands of officers and members of other ranks across the armed forces were invited to fill in a confidential questionnaire.",

        "document": "Military researchers have put dozens of soldiers, both women and men, through a series of drills Wednesday aimed at helping the Army develop a unisex test to decide which troops are fit for combat. Fort Stewart spent weeks training volunteers in performing tasks the Army considers essential for troops on front lines- from dragging a wounded comrade to safety to loading 65 pound anti-tank missiles. Scientists from the Army's Research Institute for Environmental Medicine had volunteer soldiers don oxygen masks and heart-rate monitors to record their exertion. Scroll down for video . Changing the tests: Commanders want front line tests to more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen, tank crews and other combat troops perform (soldiers in Fort Drum pictured doing a physical fitness test) Old tricks: Commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push-ups, sit-ups and 2-mile runs (a soldier is pictured doing push ups while serving in Balad, Iraq) On Tuesday the troops- 89 men and 58 women-  were timed as they toted heavy cans of ammunition and scrambled with rifles through an obstacle course laid out with orange cones. The Pentagon plans to start opening up combat jobs to women as early as 2016. Commanders want to break from longtime gauges of physical fitness that include push-ups, sit-ups and 2-mile runs in order to devise a test that more accurately mimics the most strenuous tasks that infantrymen, tank crews and other combat troops perform. Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers already in combat units. That said, they're completely unfamiliar to Army women so Fort Stewart gave its soldier-volunteers a month to train. 'When we started, it was very challenging because we'd never experienced any of these tasks before,' said Captain Nartrish Lance, 40, who after 21 years in the Army is getting her first taste of what it takes to serve in a combat unit. 'But, once you get to rehearse ... it becomes easy.' Co-ed: Drills such as scaling a 6-foot wall in 70 pounds of gear and removing the heavy barrel of a 25 mm gun on an armored vehicles are nothing new for male soldiers but they are new to female soldiers . On Tuesday the troops- 89 men and 58 women-  were timed during the run through at Fort Stewart in Georgia . In seeking fitness standards based on real-word job requirements, the Army follows many U.S. fire departments that in recent years made entrance tests fairer to women than old standards heavy on push-ups and other upper-body exercises that favor men. Major General Mike Murray, commander of Fort Stewart's 3rd Infantry Division, said allowing women into combat units will do more than break one of the military's last gender barriers. He noted a very small Army 'population' will qualify, adding 'this overall effort is really about matching skill sets and attributes to the right job.' Whatever fitness test emerges for combat service should be a challenge for both men and women to show that standards aren't being lowered to accommodate female soldiers, said Lory Manning, a retired Navy captain who studies how military policies affect women for the Women's Research and Education Institute. 'The idea for the military isn't that any women coming through can pass their test,' Manning said. 'It's that anybody male or female who can pass the test should be able to serve in that occupation. If it's one woman out of a thousand, so be it.'",

        "document": "Editor's note: Ben Chavis is the co-author with Carey Blakely of \"Crazy Like A Fox: One Principal's Triumph in the Inner City.\" Chavis received his doctorate in education and philosophy from the University of Arizona and served as principal of American Indian Public Charter School for seven years. Chavis has also worked as a real estate investor. Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada. Educator Ben Chavis says money isn't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators. (CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results. But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed? The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $602 million for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Katy Murphy, an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune. That budget, which includes $77 million spent on consultants, means that the district spends an average of $16,270 per student! What have we, the public taxpayers, received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools? According to the California Department of Education, the district's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show: . 1. Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level.  See details about K-12 schools, teachers » . 2. Of 2,506 ninth- and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra: 0 percent tested advanced, 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test. How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students' academic performance in mathematics? During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money. We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority, with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families. AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts. In 2009, they excelled in academics, physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given. The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students. Before I became its principal, people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo. The neighbors hated it. They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area. Unfortunately, the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed. The school was in many ways a failure, a joke, a sham. When I took over as principal in 2000, it was the worst middle school in Oakland. I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best. I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff, students and families: If you act like a winner, you'll be treated like a winner. If you act like a fool, you'll be treated like a fool. The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized. The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world. Yet, we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country. I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators. We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society. The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money. Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money? President Obama is moving in the \"right\" direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money. It's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions, including public schools. Next time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district. Then you do the math. After all, it's your money they want to take. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Chavis.",

        "document": "By . Emma Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:22 EST, 9 December 2013 . A 17-year-old boy who murdered a man with a single punch just days after he wildly attacked strangers at random in the street was jailed for life today. Eden Lomax had been caught on CCTV dealing one-punch knockouts to two innocent men during what he boasted were his personalised ‘bomb’ attacks. As one victim collapsed unconscious into the entrance of the nearby bus, Lomax was overheard joking: ‘I think he wants an adult day saver’. Scroll down for video . 17-year-old Eden Lomax (left) has been found guilty of the murder of Simon Mitchell (right) with one punch . First attack: CCTV footage of the first attack where on the night of Friday, 7 June 2013, just seven days before Simon died, Lomax punched a 31-year-old man in the face as stood at a bus stop . Attack: CCTV of the second attack, four days after the first. This time Lomax punched a drunken 41-year-old man without warning after they struck up a conversation . Just three days after the assaults in Bolton town centre the ginger haired teenager fatally set about Simon Mitchell after laughing and telling friends: 'I’m going to bomb him.' Mr Mitchell, 43, was thumped in the face and sent crashing to the ground after trying to shake Lomax’s hand saying: 'What’s a bomb?' Then as the victim laying dying on the floor with a fractured skull caused when his head hit the pavement, Lomax retorted: 'That’s a f***ing bomb.' A 16-year-old boy attempted to tend to the victim but Lomax told him to leave it because 'the piece of s*** deserved it,' it was claimed. Lomax fled the scene to drink and play computer games at a friend’s house as fork lift truck driver Mr Mitchell lay in the street. He was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from serious head and brain injuries. Pictures from the horrifying CCTV footage emerged as Lomax was convicted of murder following a two week trial. Today, he was ordered to serve a mininum of ten years in jail. Second attack: Lomax punched the victim once in the face, the force of the punch knocked him backwards through the open doors of a waiting bus . Knocked down: Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance . 'Bully': Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, described Lomax as a 'coward and a bully' The judge Mr Justice Peter Openshaw said: 'What he did suggests cowardly enthusiasm to resort to violence against men who through drinking were unable to defend themselves. 'Simon Mitchell was vulnerable through drink whereas the defendant is well built, physically fit and strong. Mr Mitchell was inoffensively telling him his problems. The defendant’s reaction was to deliver this punch.' Manchester Crown Court was told in the days before the tragedy on June 14 Lomax attacked ‘men he didn’t know from Adam’, leaving them prone in the street. CCTV footage was shown in court of Lomax unleashing a vicious blow to the face of 30-year-old Stephen Swanton at a bus stop on Blackhorse Street, Bolton - because he had put his arm around Lomax and a female friend. A few seconds pass before Mr Swanton is knocked off his feet by the punch, hitting his head on a nearby wall leaving him unconscious. Lomax can be then seen walking calmly away while a number of youths run quickly across the road.Further video evidence was served of the incident on June 11 at Bolton bus station, where Lomax punched 41-year-old Paul Caulderbank with so much force to the back of the head that he fell through the open doors of a nearby stationary bus and remained on the floor until the driver came to assistance. The tragedy occurred after Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O’Donnell. He bumped into Lomax who had been watching movies with friends on an Ipad at around 8pm. Mr Mitchell made innocuous remarks expressing his sadness that two of his friends had recently committed suicide. But Lomax then ‘snapped’, as his own stepfather had also taken his own life and started saying to friends who tried to calm him down: 'I’m going to bomb him. Leave me alone or I’ll fall out with you.' Mr Mitchell, sensing trouble, offered his hand for Lomax to shake and apologised but the teenager laughed and said ‘if you don’t f*** off I will bomb you.' One eye witness told the jury: 'Eden asked the man to stop talking about suicide, but he wouldn’t listen. Eden was getting annoyed, his face dropped. 'He was getting aggressive. He was bouncing up and down on his toes. We could tell he was angry by the fact his face went red and serious and he was smiling before. 'The man asked Eden what he meant by his threat to “bomb” him and I was shocked when Eden hit him. 'It was horrible, all you could hear was his head thump. The man had turned his head around and asked what a bomb was, he wasn’t aggressive. Eden punched him and said ‘that’s a bomb.' The witness rang 999 when he could see Mr Mitchell was not moving and added: 'He wasn’t breathing properly. He was making choking noises and he had turned purple.' Police attended an address in Little Lever, Bolton, two days after the attack where they arrested Lomax. In interviews he claimed Mr Mitchell was aggressive and he reacted in self-defence. Tributes: Mr Mitchell, who lived with his father and brother, had spent the afternoon drinking in Bolton with his friend Neil O¿Donnell. He was found suffering from head injuries . Killed: Simon Mitchell, aged 43, of Bolton, was found collapsed. Simon was taken by ambulance to Royal Bolton Hospital where he was later pronounced dead . He pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. After the case Detective Chief Inspector Pete Jackson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Simon lost his life at the hands of a young thug, who was driven by aggression and pent-up violence and revelled in the fact that he could knock vulnerable people unconscious with a single punch, which he referred to as his \"bomb\". 'Like all cowards and bullies he targeted people who he knew could not defend themselves or fight back. Twice in the previous week he had knocked vulnerable men to the ground with a single punch for no reason whatsoever. 'It is was tragic way for Simon’s evening to end. It has left his father and family devastated. My thoughts are with them and I hope that the justice delivered today will provide some comfort to them. 'I hope this incident serves as a timely reminder of the real dangers to life involved when people throw a punch. Too many people have lost their lives in such incidents. I would urge people to think before they ever contemplate throwing a punch, you could cost someone their life and spend the rest of your own in a prison cell.” Prosecutor Robert Hall said: 'Mr Mitchell had the misfortune to come across Lomax and what followed was a tragic, unprovoked and thoroughly unnecessary attack by Lomax when instead he could simply have walked away. 'CCTV footage was shown at the trial as bad character evidence, this depicted the escalating pattern of violence that Lomax demonstrated in the week leading up to this fateful night should act as a severe warning to those who may be inclined to follow Lomax’s bad example. 'Whilst today’s conviction of Eden Lomax is a successful outcome in terms of justice, it does not bring back Mr Mitchell or remove the grief and distress felt by his family and friends. Our thoughts are with them.'",

        "document": "By . Gavin Mccafferty . Promoter Eddie Hearn is considering putting Ricky Burns into a high-profile domestic fight away from Scotland after attempts to get him back in the world-title mix backfired spectacularly. Burns was floored within 30 seconds of his comeback from losing his WBO lightweight belt before suffering a points loss to Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin in an official WBC eliminator. The 31-year-old looked shaken after getting up from the early left-hook counter and Zlaticanin dominated the early stages, putting Burns under pressure with some intense flurries. Floored plan: Ricky Burns is knocked down by Dejan Zlaticanin in Glasgow . On the hook! Ricky Burns is given a count after being knocked down in the first 30 seconds . The Coatbridge fighter steadied himself and looked better in the latter stages but diminutive southpaw Zlaticanin, fighting outside the Balkans for the first time, continued to cause him problems with his left hook and consistently threw the more dangerous punches before winning a split decision. However, his victory looked clear-cut to most inside Glasgow's Braehead Arena and left Burns facing an ongoing struggle to rediscover the form that made him a two-weight world champion. The counter left that the unbeaten Zlaticanin found such joy with had been utilised to good effect by Raymundo Beltran when he broke Burns' jaw in the Scot's last successful, but highly contentious, defence of his title, and in a skilful display by Terence Crawford that ended his long reign as world champion. Hearn said: 'Probably take the first four rounds away, I thought he won the fight quite comfortably, but it's the same mistakes, throwing hooks with your chin in the air and getting caught by a hooker. It was a nightmare start. 'I think we need to take him away from Scotland for his next fight, because every time he fights there is so much pressure and expectation. He is going to have a holiday and see how he feels but I can't see him quitting in a million years because he loves to fight. It's not as if he's an old man, he is physically fit and loves to fight. 'He trains harder than anyone else down the gym, his sparring is better than anyone else, but he is not delivering it in the ring. I don't know what it is. It's not desire, he still has the desire.' Same mistakes! Ricky Burns left his chin exposed to his opponent's hook . Change of venue: The British boxer could now look for a domestic fight outside of Scotland . Hearn will now look to set up an all-British fight to see if Burns can recapture his form, with the likes of Tommy Coyle, Anthony Crolla, Derry Matthews and possibly Kevin Mitchell all potential opponents. 'I don't believe Zlaticanin will go on to win a world title,' he said. 'If you can't beat him, you are not going to go on and win a world title. 'His next fight will have to be a tough domestic fight. You have to win that and then have another fight like Zlaticanin to get in the world title mix. 'This was about winning back the confidence of the people and Ricky Burns but we have taken another step back. 'But Ricky was sitting in the dressing room saying he feels he has let people down and needs to get back into the gym and improve. He was crying his eyes out.' Disappointment: Ricky Burns felt like he let people down after this latest loss . There was plenty to cheer for the home crowd earlier in the bill with Willie Limond winning a Lonsdale at the third time of asking by beating Curtis Woodhouse in a convincing points victory. The 35-year-old Commonwealth champion, whose previous attempts ended in defeat by Alex Arthur and Crolla, twice put the spirited Woodhouse on the deck with upper-cuts and boxed skilfully throughout despite the defending champion's brave comeback bid. Hearn could now fix the Glaswegian up for a shot at Italian Michele di Rocco's European belt.Edinburgh's Stephen Simmons won his grudge match with Wadi Camacho with a 10th-round stoppage following a close affair for the WBC Silver International cruiserweight belt.",

In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the freezing water of the pool at Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine while crouching down in order to pray.

In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men climbed into a pool of freezing water at the Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine in central Tokyo in order to pray . The ritual is supposed to purify the followers in order to bring them closer to kame - spirits or powers - which they believe will bring them good fortune . Happy New Year: Kanchu Misogi is a traditional new year festival in Japan for followers of Shinto which is supposed to purify body and soul and bring good fortune . The ritual is celebrated across Japan and usually involved participants washing themselves with cold water, but can also involve being covered in snow. Shinto is less of a religion and more of a way of life, and followers perform many rituals designed to please kame - meaning spirits or powers. This particular shrine is dedicated to Inari, one of the most important kame who brings success, prosperity and fertility. Despite their obvious suffering in these pictures, followers of Shinto believe that the spirits want humans to be happy and are willing to help them if they are treated correctly. Around 100 followers took part in the ceremony which is celebrated all over Japan, but usually just involves washing in cold water . The temple seen here is dedicated to Inari, one of the main kame of Shinto, who can bring people prosperity, success and fertility . Shinto is more of a way of life, rather than a religion, as it has no commandments, no God, no founder and allows people to follow other beliefs . Desite this man's suffering, Shiinto teaches that humans are essentially good and that the spirits that watch over them love them and want them to succeed . Shinto has no God or Gods, no founder, no central commandments and allows people to follow other religions. Instead it teaches ethical principles and a love of oneself. Shinto, which translates as 'way of the spirits', is intricately linked with the geography of Japan, and so is rarely practiced outside of the country. Purity is at the heart of Shinto's understanding of good and evil. Pollution - tsumi - can be physical, moral or spiritual. Being pure is incredibly important to believers of Shinto, though their equivalent of sin - tsumi - is usually caused by things outside of people's control, rather than people themselves . Shinto means 'way of the spirits' and is seldom worshipped outside of Japan because of its very strong link with the Japanese landscape . Other purity rituals in Shinto can involve going long periods without sleep, breathing exercises, standing under waterfalls and other balance training . The ritual also helps to keep the participants physically fit and tests their endurance . Tsumi means much the same as the English word 'sin', but it differs from sin in that it includes things which are beyond the control of individual human beings and are thought of as being caused by evil spirits. In ancient Shinto, tsumi also included disease, disaster and error. Anything connected with death or the dead is considered particularly polluting.",

I have worked really hard to get back to . my fittest and I hope we have a successful summer. I’m just glad I can . be part of it.’ It . is, of course, wise to be cautious about a cricketer who had so many . injury problems and Flintoff needs to come through a club game for St . Annes this weekend and a  second-team match next Thursday before he is . fully ready. Banter: Flintoff shares a joke with former team-mate Mark Butcher . Famous face: Andrew Flintoff will make his comeback to cricket for Lancashire in the T20 Blast . Putting his back into it: Flintoff will play a 2nd XI game for Lancashire next week and will then play in the T20s . Yet a cricketer who is clearly fitter . and leaner now than in his prime, thanks  perhaps to his excursion into . boxing as part of his diverse cricketing after-life, has worked hard to . be ready for this. Nothing seems likely to stop him now. Not many . sporting stars have the opportunity to go out on top, as Flintoff truly . did five years ago, and there will be those who will be keeping their . fingers crossed that this comeback does not end in tears.Flintoff . has clearly missed the game and would love his children to see him play. It is that motivation which has led to this, even though a twisted . ankle two weeks ago kept his comeback on ice — quite literally. The . moment when MCC told him they did not want him to play in their . star-studded bicentenary game at Lord’s in July, as revealed by Charles . Sale in Sportsmail, crystalised  Flintoff’s determination to come back. ‘John . Stephenson from MCC phoned me and I thought it was to tell me where to . turn up and who else would be in the side,’ said Flintoff in a BBC Radio . 5 Live interview. ‘My kids were in the car and he told me he didn’t . want me. He said they had Brian Lara and all these other people. I . thought. The return: Lancashire have announced Flintoff's return . 'They’re all 10 years older than me and they haven’t played for . years”. I saw my kids’ faces and it was the first time they’d seen . their dad told he couldn’t do something. They said, “Never mind, there . will be other games” and I thought, “There will be, actually”. ‘I . was getting knocked back and wanting to play, practising and realising . “I can still do this”. And there is unfinished business from when I . retired. I’d sooner have a go and have it not come off than sit at home . for the rest of my days thinking, “I should have tried it, I should have . had a go”. I don’t live my life like that.’ Flintoff, whose . friendship with Lancashire captain and interim coach Glen Chapple . facilitated the move, admitted his return to the nets has not been pain . free. ‘When I’m bowling it still hurts a bit,’ he said. ‘But I’m loving . running in and if I can take that into a game I might be dangerous. ‘I . don’t want this to be one year. You see Brad Hogg playing in the Big . Bash, Brad Hodge is playing for Australia at 39 and  Glen Chapple is 40 . and still charging in for Lancashire in four-day games.’ It would be . stretching a point to believe Flintoff could again play in Championship . cricket or, as will inevitably be speculated, for England in Twenty20. Yet he is clearly serious about doing himself justice for Lancashire and . that must surely be a good thing for both him and his county. We wish . him well.",

        "document": "Manchester United head to the Black Country and a game at West Brom on Monday night with manager Louis van Gaal hoping for a performance and a result that will kick-start his reign at Old Trafford. The Dutch coach has said he needs a result similar to the Champions League win at Juventus that suddenly fired his Bayern Munich team in to life in December 2009. The Hawthorns may seem a long way from the Stadio Olimpico in Turin but if Van Gaal is to see his new team produce the first comprehensive performance of his time in the Barclays Premier League then here are five things that must happen. Radamel Falcao celebrates after scoring his first goal for Manchester United to secure a win against Everton . UNITED MUST KEEP GOING . After years of seeing United snatch results at the end of games, the reverse has been true this season. Sir Alex Ferguson revealed last year that his United teams actually used to practice scoring late goals in training. Van Gaal's players, though, don't seem to be able to play beyond an hour, having failed to score a single goal after 63 minutes in any competition all season. Juan Mata lifts a weight in training as Manchester United's players work on their strength and fitness . Their last two home games – wins against Everton and West Ham – saw United hanging on at the end, saved by goalkeeper David de Gea and a linesman's flag in those matches. Whether it is a psychological issue – indicative perhaps of a lack of confidence – or something to do with physical fitness, it is hard to say. Van Gaal's messages regarding his training sessions have been contradictory though – saying last Friday he has had to lower the intensity at Carrington – and he needs to find a way to get 90 minutes out of his players tonight. Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs are yet to see United score after the 63rd minute this season . FIND THE REAL ROBIN VAN PERSIE . When Van Persie dived to head in Holland's equaliser in their opening World Cup game against Spain back in June, the bond between the United striker and his coach for club and country seemed clear. Since then, though, Van Persie has done little to suggest a return to the scoring heights of his first United season two years ago is imminent. He has not been dreadful this season, far from it. He has scored two Premier League goals, which is only one less than Wayne Rooney and is one more than Radamel Falcao. Robin van Persie has only netted two goals in six Premier League appearances under Louis van Gaal . However, the Dutchman is not the free-running irresistible force of two years ago and it is tempting to wonder if he would actually start on Monday night were Rooney not suspended. Rumours persist of ongoing problems with Van Persie's knee while an argument with team-mates during last week's Holland win over Kazakhstan saw him criticised by former captain Mark van Bommel. As we know, Van Persie likes to be the star of the show. Time to show that he deserves to be, perhaps. Van Persie (second from left) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Leicester City . KEEP THE BALL . Van Gaal is nothing if not honest and recently he hinted at a modern United issue when he said: 'I want to improve so we don't lose the ball so easily. That is our problem, not our defence. We are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline.' The days of United smothering opposition with possession seem a long time ago now. David Moyes' team certainly didn't do it and even the latter years of the Sir Alex Ferguson saw United play much more counter attacking football than they wished. Falcao, pictured tussling with Gareth Barry, may not be used to his defensive duties at Old Trafford just yet . Now that United have a team packed with ball players, it shouldn't be that difficult but one wonders if the likes of Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Juan Mata are prepared to do as much work in their own half as the Premier League tends to ask. After all, the first things good teams – really good teams – tend to do when they lose the ball is get it back again. FIND A SCREEN . United are away from home on Monday night and that usually dictates that a team will have to spend some time in their own half. West Brom may not be the most glamorous or talked-about team in the Premier League but they are quite happy to get on the front foot in front of their own supporters and that will certainly be the case early on at The Hawthorns. When that happens, United need to find a way to screen the back four. With Van Gaal playing so many attacking players each week, the demands on more defensively-minded players like Daley Blind simply increase. Daley Blind (right), pictured in action against QPR, has impressed in a defensive midfield role so far . Blind looks to be an exceptional purchase so far, a hard-working, intelligent player who buys in to the team ethic naturally and is happy to do his bit without the need for fanfare. However, against the Baggies he will need some help from whoever players alongside him. Ideally it would be Michael Carrick, who brings some height and physicality to the role. However he is not quite fit so if the Spaniard Ander Herrera is pressed into action despite the pain of his rib injury he will need to sacrifice a little of his naturally offensive tendencies to help protect what continues to be a rather uncertain United back four. Ander Herrera may need to play a more defensive role against West Brom at The Hawthorns . KEEP THE ANGEL FLYING . With Rooney serving the second game of his suspension and nobody sure what we are going to get from players like Van Persie and Mata, it is imperative that the talented Di Maria continues his good form. Di Maria has taken to life in the Premier League without breaking stride and his performances for Van Gaal have been a consistent bright spot of United's rather up and down season so far. Angel di Maria has three goals and three assists in five Premier League appearances for the Red Devils . The great thing about a free-running forward like Di Maria is that he attracts players to him when he has the ball – and to a lesser degree when he hasn't – and that spreads uncertainty in a defence and, of course, leave spaces open for other players to exploit. United haven't really had anything like this since Cristiano Ronaldo left and the similarities between the two players are clear. Ronaldo could be devastating away from home as United flew at teams on the counter and Di Maria can be the same in the Black Country. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . The body of a Florida restaurant owner has been found six days after he disappeared while diving into the Ganges to save a holiday-maker. Hector Rolotti, who ran the popular Novecento chain, which has four restaurants in Miami, had been on a yoga retreat in India with his wife, Mora Barber, when he was swept away. The 47-year-old was one of six people who jumped into the river on Monday, after seeing a member of the retreat crying out for help. Found: The body of Hector Rolotti, pictured with wife Mora, has been found six days after he was swept away . For a week search teams had searched sections of the river near Rishikesh, where Rolotti was last seen, in the hope of finding him. Success: Rolotti opened the the first of many restaurants at the age of 24 . Because the father-of-three was physically fit, family and friends had held out a glimmer of hope that he had somehow survived, after being pulled under by the strong current. On Saturday, his restaurant group released a statement saying the Argentinian-born restaurateur's body had been found. 'It is with great sadness that Novecento . Group informs that the body of founding parter Hector Rolotti was found . in the Ganges River,' the statement, published in the Miami Herald, said. 'The body . was found intact due to the low temperatures of the Ganges this time of . year. He was found by a group of locals who then alerted the authorities . and search team.' Rolotti and his wife had been on a yoga retreat, which they attended every year. The . couple had been in India for about a week, and were due to return this . weekend. Instead, Rolotii will now be cremated before his ashes are . returned to Miami and Argentina. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Rolotti at the weekend, remembering him as 'a tireless entrepreneur and family man, always concerned about his children, wife and parents'. A customer at one of his Florida restaurants commented on his efforts to save a friend, telling CBS Miami: 'I think it’s heroic and very inspirational and hopefully his journey in the afterlife is taking him somewhere else pleasant.' A statement from the restaurant read: 'Hector’s great . achievement with Novecento was much more than a restaurant chain, it is a . meeting point for friends and communities.' Retreat: Rolotti and his wife had been on a yoga holiday along the Ganges, when one of their friends fell in . Rolotti was just 24 when he opened his first Novecento restaurant in SoHo. He had left Argentina for New York and, by 1991 had founded the first of many successful establishments. His philosophy behind what made a great restaurant, he told Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, was to create a place where 'people can meet friends or do business'. 'Just providing food doesn’t make it. You have to offer more, you have to set up places people want to meet,' he said. Rolotti went on to open 13 branches of his restaurant, including four in Miami, two in Mexico, five in Argentina, and one in Uruguay.",

        "document": "By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medal winner in track and field who once set world records for sprinting, said Monday that New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie tripped him up in 2011 he tried a run of a different kind – for political office. Current Lieutenant Gov. Kim Guadagno, then the state's attorney general, ruled that Lewis hadn't lived in the Garden State long enough to run for a seat in the state senate. He was preparing to run as a Democrat against Republican state Sen. Dawn Addiego, a Christie friend and ally. The story of Lewis' frustrating political hurdle is well-known in New Jersey, but he claimed Monday that Christie tried to force him out of the race by threatening to scuttle his role as the state's first physical fitness ambassador – a move he later made when Lewis took Guadagno to court. 'I felt like he was trying to intimidate me, absolutely,' the legendary athlete told the Star-Ledger in Newark. 'But I definitely didn’t feel intimidated.' Carl Lewis won 9 gold medals as a track and field athlete, and was best-known as a sprinter and long-jumper, but he allegedly found his political aspirations squashed when he tried to unseat a Christie chum . Man of the people: Lewis celebrated after winning the Olympic long jump competition during the 1996 Atlanta games . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has faced complaints about his bullying government style as the 2016 presidential circus approaches . 'It's interesting, everyone calling him a bully,' Lewis said. 'I don't really see him as a bully. I see it more as someone who's insecure, and he's governor now and has got the power.' An administrative law judge originally sided with Lewis, saying he met the requirements for putting his name on the ballot since he grew up in the new Jersey township of Willingboro. But Guadagno personally overturned that ruling, based on the fact that he had voted in California two years earlier. Christie and Guadagno have both attracted new claims of partisan bullying in recent weeks from adversaries. Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, has speculated that Christie presided over a politically motivated closure of highway lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as part of a retribution scheme against him after he declined to endorse Christie's re-election. That scandal has already led to the resignation of two Christie appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the firing of two Christie aides. And Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, claims Guadagno carried a message to her from Christie, saying he would hold her city's Hurricane Sandy relief money hostage unless she approved a commercial development plan he favored. Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno was the New Jersey attorney general when Lewis tried to run for the state senate, and overruled a judge in disqualifying him from the ballot . Christie has looked haggard in recent days, as pressure mounts over his administration's handling of several new scandals . Lewis won the 100 meter sprint at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, but couldn't get anywhere near a political finish line, he says, after Christie and Kim Guadagno intervened . Guadagno has categorically denied the allegation, but Zimmer has shared notes from her journal with a federal prosecutor who is already investigating Christie over what has become known as 'Bridgegate.' Lewis' almost-appointment as New Jersey's youth fitness czar, he said at the time, turned sour after he pressed forward with his bid to unseat Addiego, the governor's friend. 'I thought it was going just fine,' as Lewis  recalled for the Star-Ledger. 'And when I started to run, when he talked to me on the phone that night, he said \"If you run, we're going to have to cancel the program\".' The Christie administration ultimately spent $78,000 in attorney staffers' time to remove Lewis from the ballot, according to public records. But at the time, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak insisted that the governor never triedto step between Lewis and any political finish line. 'Absolutely, positively not. And anybody who says otherwise is lying,' he said then, although he did say Christie told Lewis that he needed to support his long-time friend. Drewniak, like 17 other officials, is under subpoena in connection with Bridgegate. Carl Lewis (L) took a rare silver medal in the 100-meter sprint at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, but earned the gold after apparent winner Ben Johnson (R) was later disqualified for failing a drug test .",

'Moral panic' about the internet among middle class parents is stunting children's development, a leading psychologist has warned. Professor Tanya Byron believes that unless parents let their children explore and make mistakes - both in the real-world and online - they will never become 'digitally responsible'. However, she added that managing these risks, and guiding children through them, is ultimately the responsibility of the adults in their lives, both at home and school. Speaking at a teacher conference in Birmingham, Professor Byron expressed concerns about the ‘moral panic’ that surrounds young people and the web. She said: ‘The moral panic is unhelpful. Awareness without life experience can sometimes be challenging – so it’s our responsibility to bridge that gap.’ ‘We need to accept that kids are going to take risks online so that we can guide them, just as our parents did when we were allowed to ride our bikes.’ Two-thirds of parents in a recent Co-operative Childcare survey said their children spent significantly less time outside than the parents did. Eight in ten said their own favourite activities as children involved being outdoors, but only half their children lead the same active life. British adults said they loved playing ball games, skipping and other traditional outdoor activities. But their children prefer to get their kicks from a screen, by playing computer games, surfing the internet or watching TV. Children can't become digitally responsible citizens unless they're allowed to take risks online. Stock image pictured.

A father born without functioning hands is suing Six Flags theme park after he was stopped from riding the Aquaman Splashdown. Clint Bench, who does not have fully formed hands, says he was 'embarrassed' after being told to get off the ride by staff at the Six Flags Over Texas in front of his children. In the suit, filed in Dallas federal court, Mr Dench says the amusement park violated the Americans With Disabilities Act. Clint Bench had bought three season tickets to Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in Arlington but was told he could not ride the Aquaman Splashdown because he has no hands . The father-of-two, from Weatherford, Texas, said when he tried to board the ride last May he was told by an employee to leave 'because he does not have hands', according to Dallas News. In the suit, Mr Bench said it caused him 'considerable embarrassment' as his children had never seen him discriminated before. Aquaman riders sit in a boat that travels down into water, causing a large wave to soak them. The papers filed on Tuesday say: 'Mr Bench is a physically fit, healthy adult with great . upper body strength. He can perform all manners of activities, including . activities that one would normally assume would require the use of . hands.' He can write, type, tie his shoes, fire a gun and enjoys water skiing and mountain biking and has never considered using prosthetics, it said. Mr Dench said he was 'embarrassed' and he said his children had never seen him being discriminated against . Mr Bench is suing for an undisclosed amount for 'mental anguish' as well as a refund for the three Six Flags season tickets he had bought and his attorney's fees. Lawyers for Mr Bench claim the amusement park altered its restriction rules after he made a complaint. A guide, they claim was written in September, now states that Aquaman riders 'must have one full arm and one full leg.' Dallas News quoted the papers as saying: 'Mr Bench - who is capable of riding every ride at Six Flags Over Texas, and who has done so many times without injury to himself of others - is now unable to enjoy the rides with his family.;' It added that people who choose to raise their hands in the air 'in a silly display of bravado' are not prevented from going on further rides. Sharon Parker, the spokesperson for Six Flags, told Dallas News that she had not seen the suit 'but generally we don’t comment on pending litigation.'",

        "document": "By . Rosemarie Lentini . Arrested: Raymond Michael Miranda, 14 (pictured) has been accused of viciously beating an 87-year-old woman at a California nursing home . A 14-year-old boy accused of brutally beating an elderly woman while she slept in her nursing home bed, has been arrested following a nearly week-long manhunt in California. Police nabbed Raymond Michael Miranda in a Temecula hotel room last night over the April 17 attack which left an 87-year-old woman fighting for her life in hospital. Raymond and a 15-year-old boy allegedly broke into the unidentified woman's room at the Camelot Independent Living complex in Hemet and violently beat her in a botched robbery attempt about 2am. Some reports also claim they splashed bleach on the victim. While officials are legally prohibited from identifying juvenile suspects, investigators made an exception with Raymond who they say is dangerous. While the 15-year-old boy was arrested on the day of the attack, officers were forced to circulate fliers with Raymond's name and photo in order to find him. A neighbor told police they spotted the teenage boys outside the woman's living quarters on West Oakland Avenue in the early morning hours of April 17. 'It's . an 87-year-old victim minding her own business in the safety of her own . home,' police Lt. Dean Evans told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. '(She was) accosted and beaten severely and is now in critical condition. The feeling is, if they’ll do that to an 87-year-old lady, they’ll do it to anyone else they come across. So we feel the public might be at risk and we want to prevent that.' Investigators said it appeared the victim was not specifically targeted and they don't know how long the 'torture' lasted. They believe burglary was the motive. Evans told Riverside Press-Enterprise that Raymond has had 'extensive contacts' with Hemet police. 'I know he has some contact with the juvenile justice system,' the lieutenant said, but did not provide details. Raymond's arrest warrant alleges attempted murder, burglary and torture.

        "document": "(CNN) -- When rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings didn't work for Eddie Freas, he sought another way to kick his 20-year drug and alcohol addiction. Eddie Freas fights drug addiction by putting all his energy into training for triathlons. He swam 2.4 miles. He biked 112 miles. He ran 26.2 miles. The Pennsville, New Jersey, resident found relief in triathlons. \"I feel better when I'm working out,\" said Freas, 33. \"It does wonders for the mind. The reason I started running -- it was a switch that went off in my head. I started feeling positive and feeling great about myself.\" Freas spent his youth in pursuit of drugs. At the age of 13, he snuck bottles of Amaretto and rum from his mother's liquor cabinet. He also developed a taste for marijuana and cocaine. By his senior year of high school, Freas was kicked off the wrestling and football teams after failing a drug test. Then in 2007, after a three-day binge, \"I came home and was crying,\" Freas said. \"I was so depressed. I turned on the TV.\" The set was tuned to ESPN, which was airing a story about a former drug addict who competed in triathlons. The program's subject was Todd Crandell, who had lost a college hockey scholarship because of a drug addiction. After 13 years of using drugs, Crandell started competing in Ironman races and championed finding positive ways to fight addiction through his program called Racing for Recovery. \"Having an athletic background, I was drawn to getting back in shape,\" Crandell said. \"It makes you turn intellectually and spiritually fit. Exercise is essential. It decreases addiction, depression and you use it as part of the recovery.\" Freas was entranced by the parallels. \"His whole story seemed like mine,\" Freas said. \"That's why it hit me so much. It was my story but it happened to somebody else. I knew I had to get back into fitness.\" He took a bus to Racing for Recovery's office in Sylvania, Ohio. There, Freas said he learned to \"stay clean and use other things -- fitness, instead of drugs.\" On his first day, Freas pushed himself to run 10 miles. \"It killed me,\" Freas said. \"I was just motivated. I was sore for a week and I gradually got into it. As soon as I started including fitness into my everyday lifestyle, it made it so much easier. It kept me busy and because of the physical fitness, it was making me feel better about myself.\" He pushed himself to run farther and raced in his first Ironman competition in 2008. \"It's different when you use drugs, you temporarily feel good and afterwards, you feel like doing more drugs,\" Freas said. \"When you go for a long run and do physical fitness, you feel good doing it.\" Research in animals and humans show that exercise can be a mild antidepressant. \"It isn't a huge surprise when you consider many positive effects exercise can have with regards to the brain chemistry: dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, epinephrine -- these are all associated with mood altering effects,\" said Dr. Cedric Bryant, the chief science officer for the American Council on Exercise. \"If they're able to get this natural high, through a natural endeavor such as exercise, it allows them to replace the means to achieve that high with a more positive approach.\" One study showed that women trying to quit smoking were more successful when they exercised. And the National Institute on Drug Abuse held a conference last year to explore the possible role of physical activity in substance abuse prevention. \"The thought centers around the release of mood-altering brain chemical, mainly endorphins,\" Bryant said. \"It gives you euphoria or what you call 'runner's high.' \" Crandell said some people who battle drug addiction \"want something more than sitting in support groups filled with smoke, complaining about drinking.\" \"I've had some of my naysayers from other programs who say you've taken one addiction and replaced it for another,\" Crandell said. \"I've taken addiction and put into a new focus that includes exercise. Exercise for me is essential to my recovery and well-being.\" The purpose of Racing for Recovery is not to turn everyone into an athlete, but to focus on positive pursuits in a person's life. \"Whatever you lost during your addiction, that should be your Ironman, not just running,\" Crandell said. \"If your goal is to become a teacher, let that be your Ironman.\" After Freas spent six months in Ohio, he returned to his hometown. \"I didn't want to come back home, because this was where I did all the dirt, all the partying and stuff,\" Freas said. \"As time went on, I had to come back here. My life is turned around. I got to help people in my hometown.\" Back in New Jersey, Freas helped train Dustin Deckard, 19, a former high school star wrestler, who is recovering from a four-year heroin addiction. Deckard wanted to get clean after a near-fatal overdose. \"I have to be clean the rest of my life,\" Deckard said. \"Sometimes that overwhelms me. I just feel that sometimes it's not fair that other people can go out and have fun and drink and do whatever at a party. But me -- if I do anything -- it's off. I can't stop. I definitely have troubles with that.\" Freas and Deckard have developed a brotherhood. \"I know how he was feeling, being down, not wanting to use drugs,\" Deckard said. \"I just relate to him in every way. We both used. He's also into sports and into wrestling like I was. That's what's cool.\" This Sunday, Freas and Deckard head to Racing for Recovery's half triathlon at Monroe, Michigan where the teen will race for the first time.",

Death: Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide . A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, . Mr Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a . guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

They . have said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous . racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and . sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit . as the rest of the platoon. On the day that he eventually ended . his life, he had forgotten his helmet and his water when he went to . report to the guardhouse. His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 . meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the . while having other soldiers throw rocks at him.

        "document": "Existing on a spartan diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables might not sound particularly appetising, but Susan Reynolds, 29, says it keeps her looking so young, she is regularly mistaken for a 16-year-old. Susan, who hails from Edinburgh, last ate cooked food seven years ago and now consumes nothing but uncooked fruit, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, and beans. The slim 29-year-old eats dozens of portions of fruit and vegetables every day, and has even created a number of recipes, including a cold soup made from a bag of spinach, a large bunch of herbs and an entire lettuce, to make meals more interesting. Youthful: Susan claims her raw food diet is the reason for her fresh-faced looks and healthy body . Her healthy raw diet is a far cry from her university days, when, she admits, she used to indulge in Chinese buffet suppers. She also loved McDonalds McChicken Sandwiches and used to enjoy crazy nights downing shots of vodka jelly as a teenager. However, all that changed when she became interested in yoga at the age of 21 during a six-month trip to India. After coming home Susan decided to become a vegetarian and trained to be a yoga teacher before stumbling across the raw food diet. 'I went for something to eat in a cafe called Red Sugar in Edinburgh, which served raw food,' she explains. 'The owners told me a bit about it so I went home, read up on it and decided to give it a go. The difference I felt in a day was incredible so I've done it ever since. I haven't had a hot meal in seven years. Tasty: Susan begins her day with a litre of green juice made from blended spinach, a lettuce and herbs . Business: Susan has turned her passion into a company that offers healthy raw food retreats to the public . 5am: Wake up, drink 750ml lemon water . 6:30am to 8:30am: Yoga practice. 10am: A litre of green juice made fromblending a whole lettuce, a bag ofspinach and bunch of herbs. 11am to 4pm: Snacks, including whole fruit (figs, mangoes, berries etc.), raw chocolate, green juice, and superfoods such as bee pollen and berries. 6pm: Large salad and/or green soups, or another raw dish created from fruit and vegetables, soaked nuts and seeds depending on what she feels she needs that day. 'The benefits include [mental] clarity, positivity, health, energy, radiance and the ability to make choices. 'Other things people have commented on include smelling good, great skin and youthfulness. People say I look good for my age. I'm also emotionally balanced and happy.' And Susan has now turned her passion for raw food into a business named Twist and Sprout, which offers healthy retreats where participants are taught how to introduce the raw food diet to their own lives. Tough though her regime might sound, Susan says she never suffers from cravings for cooked and maintains dietary discipline at all times. 'I feel if you sort out the emotional attachment to cooked food you don't crave it any more,' she explains. 'I focus on a very high liquid diet with lots of green juice, smoothies, soups and \"elixirs\". I try to get as much leaf green veggies in to my diet as possible. I eat fruits for energy and sparingly eat fats from nuts, seeds and coconut.' So dedicated is Susan to her raw food lifestyle, she even convinced her parents and boyfriend Louie, 22, to try the diet, and last Christmas prepared a raw food feast for them to enjoy. Creative: Susan has come up with a number of different menus and even managed to make raw mince pies . 'I made a fruit platter for starters - they loved it,' she reveals. 'We had raw mince pies made from nuts seeds and fruits for our sweet. I ate a giant salad with sprouted breads for my main course.' Nevertheless, Susan admits that her father David, who grew up in Glasgow, is unlikely to give up his pies despite regularly working out. Her mother Marion, meanwhile, is no stranger to unusual diets and according to Susan, cured herself of ME 14 years ago by completely eliminating sugar from her diet. 'Mum used to be practically bed-ridden but she reversed it with the sugar-free diet,' remembers Susan. 'She doesn't have ME any more. I think her experience was one of the things that inspired me.'",

A judge who sent a topless picture of himself to a court employee has kept his position, but received a public censure over the sexting scandal. Wade McCree made headlines after the husband of a bailiff revealed that his wife had received an apparently erotic photograph of the judge. Now the Michigan Supreme Court has criticised him for bringing 'shame and obloquy' on his profession and becoming the object of 'jokes and ridicule'. Inappropriate: Judge Wade McCree sent this nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff . McCree admitted in April that he had sent a naked picture of the top half of his body to court bailiff LaDawnn Malone. He initially boasted of his physical fitness, memorably saying: 'I've got no shame in my game.' But . the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology, saying: 'I am . embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions, which have hurt and caused . great pain to my family.' A . ruling issued yesterday by the Michigan Supreme Court allowed McCree to . keep his job, but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics. The . court declared that the judge 'conducted himself in a flippant manner . and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have. As a . result, he brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary.'

        "document": "(CNN) -- Sunday is National Grandparents Day. If you go to your local greeting card store, you can probably find plenty of cards to appreciate your grandmother, your grandfather, both your grandparents, your stepgrandparents, maybe even your two grandmothers who are a couple. What's missing? A card to thank the professional home care workers who help our grandparents survive and thrive in their old age. More than 90% of Americans agree that senior citizens should be able to age in their homes and communities. You don't want to visit your grandparents in a nursing home any more than they want to live there. But for the stay-at-home elderly to have so-called \"independent living\" they must be highly dependent on the home care aides who look after medication schedules, cook meals, assist with bathing and generally keep them happy and healthy. And yet these workers are anything but well cared for. The vast majority are dreadfully overworked and woefully underpaid. The average hourly wage of a home care worker in the United States is less than $10. In addition, most of these workers aren't professionalized health care aides with workplace benefits and protections, but are low-income African-American and immigrant women hired to fill in the gaps in our strained senior care system. That strain is only getting worse. Today in America, every eight seconds someone turns 65. This year alone, an estimated 4 million Americans will become senior citizens. The unprecedented wave of aging baby boomers is quickly multiplying the existing challenges of elder care. To meet the needs of tomorrow's seniors, we will need to add at least 1.6 million new trained and qualified care worker jobs by 2020. In a struggling economy with persistently high unemployment, the immediate need for 1.6 million new workers could be seen as an opportunity. But if all those jobs come with low wages and no benefits and rights, the graying of America will darken our economy even more. National Grandparents Day was started in 1978, not as an excuse to sell greeting cards but because community organizers wanted to encourage young people to value and care for senior citizens. In fact, the idea wasn't just to send loving thoughts on one day out of each year to your own grandparents but to \"adopt a grandparent\" year-round, very much in the spirit of caring for everyone in our communities, not just our own kin. National Grandparents Day is a reminder of the values of compassion, kindness and generosity that we sadly violate in the way we treat elder care and home care workers in America today. Last month, lawmakers in the California State Senate passed the Domestic Worker Bill of Rights, which would ensure that caregivers as well as housekeepers and nannies are paid overtime and have access to meal and rest breaks and other basic rights. Similar legislation was enacted in New York state in 2010. These laws only begin to reflect the new needs of our new moment: increasing the quality of care for this generation of senior citizens by increasing the quality of life for the hardworking home care aides on which they rely. When a stroke paralyzed the right side of my grandfather's body, my grandmother couldn't care for him all on her own. She hired Mrs. Sun, a home care worker, who helped my grandfather bathe, get dressed and meet his basic daily needs. Because of the important support and care Mrs. Sun provided, my grandparents were able to live together at home for four more years. While I want to describe Mrs. Sun as a saint for what she did for my grandfather, she is also a worker, a worker who deserves to be paid fairly. My grandparents literally helped give me life, the same as yours. The least we can do is make sure the people who care for them make a livelihood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ai-jen Poo.",

        "document": "A Canadian hiker has released a video of what he thinks could be Sasquatch in the mountains near Squamish, British Columbia. The video was shot by Myles Lamont two years ago while he was hiking in the Tantalus Range, north of Vancouver. Now that it has been posted on YouTube, more than 260,000 people have viewed the footage. Scroll down for video . Standing out: The video shows a black dot of a figure apparently moving up the slope of a snow covered mountain . Is this the beast? A Canadian man who claims he filmed a possible sasquatch while hiking in the Tantalus Range near Squamish, B.C. two years ago is getting thousands of hits on YouTube after recently uploading the footage . A memorable trip: Mr Lamont was hiking with some friends in the Tantalus Range, British Columbia, north of Vancouver two years ago when he encountered the mysterious creature . Mr Lamont claims he only uploaded the video for the benefit of a couple of friends. 'We had no intention for it to gather the interest it has. We are not claiming this to be anything other than a strange encounter.' The video shows a small black dot of a figure reportedly moving up a mountain. 'Pretty sure this is Sasquatch down there,' said Mr Lamont on the video recording. 'I can't see it very well. It's this little black dot walking in the middle of the snow in the middle of nowhere.' Mr Lamont says he was able to view the . subject far better than what the video portrays as it was just a simple . point and shoot camera. 'The contrast was excellent due to the snow . behind the subject,' he says. The video is intriguing because the shape does appear to be rapidly moving up the mountain. The great outdoors: The Tantalus Range is a favourite with climbers, and also with photographers and filmmakers - and now it sees, Bigfoots . Can you spot bigfoot? Myles Lamont of Vancouver, Canada, shot this footage in the summer of 2011, but is just uploading it now, and it's garnered almost 260,000 views . Rapid ramble: Less than a minute later, the creature still seems to be moving with incredible pace against a snowy mountain-face . 'If that's human why would you walk up that ridge or that snow line?' Mr Lamont asks. 'Why would he not just go straight down?' 'Good thing we brought beers,' he jokes. 'Maybe we can lure him over here. I don't know how high we are, but we're probably close to 7,000 feet and this guy's just scampering up snow lines like it's no big deal.' He states in his posting that 'the . subject was clearly bipedal and was without snowshoes or a backpack and . wearing all one colored clothing'. 'Movement . over this kind of terrain in soft snow without snowshoes would have . been very difficult and the distance travelled over the given time period . would have been very fast for a human without proper snow travel gear.' Fake? Almost all Bigfoot footage is ¿ grainy and shot from an incredible distance, but it does appear to depict a rather large individual moving at considerably-faster-than-human speed up a snowy slope . Speedy: Whoever or whatever it was covered an vast amount of ground in a very short space of time in the most difficult of conditions . Some other interesting factors are noticed about the unusual recording. 'There was a very steep drop off below where the video was shot, easily a 300m sheer face. We were not equipped with climbing gear and a descent around would have been impossible before nightfall,' Mr Lamont says. He does not believe that the footage is that of a bear or any other wild animal. 'Perhaps the most reasonable explanation for this video is a very ill prepared hiker, hiking up a difficult section of snowline as opposed to a much easier route, one who is very physically fit and able to cover ground in unusually quick fashion and must have had very large feet as we were breaking through snow crust in just our boots.' Although some may question the authenticity of Mr Lamonts' video, over the past five years, the Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence and describe it as a 'serious study.' The group says they'll continue to collect evidence and video, which will be used in a documentary at a later date. Famous: A still from the 1972 Patterson-Gimlin film purporting to show Bigfoot . For many, Bigfoot is considered to be a combination of folklore, misidentification and hoax. Along with the Loch Ness Monster, it is commonly described as a modern-day myth - but that has not prevented a raft of sightings throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds. More recently, the Sasquatch Genome Project spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years. In the last 12 months alone there have been several reported sightings, although not all have gone uncontested. In October last year an apparent Bigfoot sighting in Pennsylvania was labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to be a huge tree stump. Hiker John Stoneman claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven-foot-tall ape-like beasts through the trees, just yards from a main road in Kinzua State Park near Bradford. But a tipster told HuffPost Weird News either Stoneman was lying or he didn't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers. In the same month it was reported researchers at the Sasquatch Genome Project screened what they claimed was conclusive evidence that the creature exists. During a news conference in Texas, the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘never before seen HD video’ of the supposed ape-like creature. The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky. The announcement came just one week after a map was released which plotted out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years. A map was released in September last year which plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years . PhD candidate Josh Stevens mapped out the 3,313 possible Sasquatch spots since 1921 and found that people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions than others. The map and data collated by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization show, for example, that Bigfoot has supposedly been spotted three times more often in Missouri than neighboring Kansas. Stevens explains on his website: 'Right away you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed. At first glance, it looks a lot like a map of population distribution.' This makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible Sasquatch viewings. Even so, there are some very bright spots around the Ohio River Valley, Mississippi River Valley, the Sierra Nevada mountains, central Florida and the Pacific Northwest. Yet it gets intriguing when Stevens maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density. As he notes: 'There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population. 'On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare.' Most of these Bigfoot hot spots are in the Western United States. Stevens acknowledges that 'terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.'",

        "document": "(CNN) -- I know just what a lot of those so-called DREAMers deserve to get for Christmas: a scolding. There are good and bad actors in every movement, and the bad ones -- if not kept in check -- can drag the good ones down with them. The term DREAMers refers to the estimated 1.4 million to 2 million young illegal immigrants who might have gotten some relief if the DREAM Act, which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military, hadn't been torpedoed in the Senate in December 2010. Having declared their intention to better themselves, some in the DREAMer movement now insist that they're entitled to better treatment than run-of-the-mill illegal immigrants. You know, like the hardworking and humble folks who cut your lawn, clean your house or care for your kids. In fact, the DREAMers seem to suggest they're due a reward for good behavior. At times, these young people act like spoiled brats. They don caps and gowns and disrupt committee hearings and occupy the offices of members of Congress. They dare police to arrest them, and then act surprised when it happens. They're not realistic, or respectful. They don't ask. They demand. As we learned recently, the DREAMers have a whole wish list of what they want from Congress next year after what is expected to be a humdinger of an immigration debate. A few weeks ago, more than 500 of these young people -- and their supporters -- were brought together in Kansas City, Missouri. by a well-funded organization called \"United We Dream,\" which bills itself as the largest immigrant youth-led network in the country. At the United We Dream 2012 National Congress, attendees voted for a national platform that demands the following: . -- \"Fair treatment for DREAMers and our families and communities, including a road map to citizenship for 11 million Americans without papers and an end to senseless deportations and abuses\"; . -- \"The ability to travel without fear, ensuring all immigrants have access to driver's licenses and the ability to visit family in other countries\"; . -- \"The elimination of barriers to higher education for immigrant youth by extending state and federal financial aid opportunities, as well as in-state tuition rates to DREAMers available to our peers\"; . -- \"An end to excessive and costly immigration enforcement policies which separate families and divide communities, such as 'Secure Communities,' E-Verify, 287G, and roadside checkpoints\"; . -- \"Access to health care and safe, fair working conditions and equal protection under the law for all\"; and . -- \"Growth and diversity of our movement for change, intensifying efforts to become more inclusive of non-Latinos, LGBTQ communities, differently abled people, people of faith, and other groups.\" Gee, kids, can we get you anything else? Maybe free massages the next time you stage a sit-in? These kids want it all. Faces of hope line up for two more years in the U.S. They demand more than just the ability to live in the United States legally and not have to worry about being deported as many others have been. This is no small thing. The Obama administration removed more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants over the last four years, and there's every indication it plans to remove just as many in a second term. Some of those who have been deported were DREAMers, despite President Obama's claim that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is removing only hardened criminals. If you believe that, you're probably also expecting a portly fellow in a red suit to come down the chimney on Christmas Eve. Last summer, Obama announced a deferred action program and offered to stop deporting DREAMers. Under the program, undocumented youth who are eligible apply for a two-year work permit. What happens after that, no one knows. The DREAMers chalked up a victory. But what some seem to really want is the golden ticket: U.S. citizenship. And they want it yesterday. They're convinced that they deserve it, and they'll settle for nothing less. Many of them reject, even ridicule, proposals by Republicans in Congress to give them legal status without citizenship -- and the voting privileges that come with it. While they probably don't realize it, their public tantrums are turning people against them and hurting the chances for a broader immigration reform package. And if they set back that cause, heaven help them. They'll sink the progress for a group of people who have given more, worked harder and made greater sacrifices -- people like their undocumented parents. You know, the people who brought them to this country in the first place for a better life, and then fed them, clothed them and sheltered them. These are the folks who told the DREAMers they were special, long before that became the official position of the immigration reform movement. That doesn't sit well with a lot of Americans -- especially U.S.-born Latinos who were raised to believe that, in this life, you get what you earn. According to polls, some 80% of them support the DREAM Act. But, for a while now, I've detected some discomfort with the DREAMers, particularly their tone and tactics. It comes from people like Arnold Torres, a Mexican-American political strategist in California (disclosure: he's a friend and business partner) who supports comprehensive immigration reform and has the credentials to prove it. More than 25 years ago, Torres was executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens and helped shape the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Today, a lot of folks on the left talk about creating a pathway to legal status for millions of the undocumented. This guy actually helped do it. DREAMers: Deferred deportation . For almost a year, I've been listening to him grumble about the DREAMers and their goals. \"It appears that the agenda was all about getting attention, believing that this would solve their issue\" he said. \"They seem to be saying, 'If you pay attention to me, I become powerful. So we may be undocumented, but we are powerful now. You mistreated us. You're denying us our dream. Now we demand that you do this for us.' Attention is necessary, but demands are not. We want solutions, but not only for one segment of a much larger community in need.\" Torres worries that the DREAMers could, through their hubris, alienate supporters and make it harder to win the backing of Republicans for a larger immigration reform plan. A lot of DREAMers are drunk on entitlement. But why should this surprise us? Feeling entitled is the American way. And these kids are as American as they come. They may have been born in another country, but -- unlike their parents -- they were raised in this one.

The Grenadier Guardsman who broke strict rules by dancing on parade outside Buckingham Palace is potentially facing a 21-day prison sentence and a £1,000 fine . The guardsman faces hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex. He also faces losing his wages for the period of his sentence – about £1,000. A source said: ‘There’s no charge in the disciplinary manuals for silly walks and dancing on parade because nobody in living memory has had the cheek to do it. ‘But this guardsman’s senior officers were livid when they saw the footage. His conduct is contrary to everything being a guardsman is about. ‘He is facing a stint in the jail with no pay and, when he returns to the Grenadiers, he could lose privileges such as going out in London with the other lads in his company. Twenty-one days has been discussed as a prison sentence. The hierarchy want to put a marker down so no guardsman dares prance around outside Buckingham Palace again.’ Footage of the unnamed soldier performing a series of ballet-style pirouettes while on guard duty has become an internet sensation, watched by more than 1.7 million people on YouTube . Last night, defence sources confirmed that Army bosses are taking legal advice before they convene a disciplinary hearing with the soldier, now nicknamed ‘Private Dancer’, who is based at Wellington Barracks close to the Palace. The Queen is understood to have been away when the soldier entertained the crowds. As tourists laughed and cheered, he repeatedly spun around, stopped mid-stride with his foot in the air for several seconds, brushed dust off his rifle and bent down as if to pick something up. The footage was uploaded on to the internet last month. But senior officers now believe he should be formally disciplined. Under the Armed Forces Act 2006, a soldier may receive a custodial sentence for ‘conduct prejudicial to good order and Service discipline’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the video. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’ Do you know the identity of the pirouetting palace guardsman?

        "document": "By . John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 10:54 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 30 September 2013 . Three times the residents of a small town had seen off the might of Tesco. So . when Britain’s biggest retailer returned for a fourth go at putting a . supermarket in their high street, the residents knew they had a real . fight on their hands. For 25 . years the people of Hadleigh in Suffolk had put up posters, written . letters and held marches to stop the retailer installing itself in the . town. Shopkeepers had warned . that the arrival of a supermarket would destroy the town by . undercutting their traditional shops and forcing them to close. But . when Tesco announced yet again it was planning to build a supermarket . in the historic wool town, where 92 per cent of buildings are listed, . the residents decided there was only one way to take on the mighty . retailer. Tesco protestors (left to right) Maureen Reddrop, Linda Garrod, Anita Young and Jim Bottley celebrated beating off supermarket giant Tesco's bid to open a store in their traditional market town . Threat: Campaigners who want to protect the High Street of Hadleigh in Suffolk have fought off Tesco again in the latest set-to in a 25-year battle . Instead of . organising a new petition or preparing placards, the town pulled . together to raise an impressive £80,000 war chest – made up of donations . from shopkeepers and individuals – to pay for a team of experts, . including a top London QC. Jan . Byrne, 77, of the Hadleigh Society, said: ‘We realised we could no . longer just argue as amateurs. It was made clear to us that the local . council was only going to take notice of professionals. ‘It . seems ridiculous to have to pour big money into it, and for a small . town to raise that kind of sum, but we did it. It shows the strength of . feeling about the prospect of Tesco moving in.’ A . small team of retired residents in the town – described by poet Sir . John Betjeman as ‘one of the most perfect small towns in England’ – . pored over every word of the supermarket’s application. They . then commissioned professional reports to highlight the possible impact . the store could have on the town’s traffic system and its economy. Seven . of the town’s  traders, including the sweetshop, a butcher and a . florist, said they would definitely shut if Tesco won permission for its . 2,500 square metre store in the town centre. A further seven stores – including the post office, a newsagent and a tile shop, said they would ‘probably’ close. Mrs Byrne said: ‘We have a medieval high street with small family shops selling local goods, and we do not want to lose it. Moment of truth: Bosses met at Hadleigh Town Hall to decide on proposals for a Tesco's in the town . 'Hands off Hadleigh': Campaigners stood outside with posters to block the move for the fourth time . ‘I want people who can give us a good service and who can tell us where the food has come from. ‘We’ve got two butchers. The food is very, very local – they can tell us the farm where the meat is from. ‘When everyone was worried about horsemeat, I knew that the beef burgers I bought had come from just up the road.’ At a packed council meeting the residents’ hard work was rewarded when permission for the store was rejected by a single vote. Peter . Beer, planning committee chairman, said: ‘The impact on the local . highway network, the effect on the vitality of the town centre in retail . terms and its design and impact on listed buildings were all . fundamental to the council’s decision.’ The campaigners greeted the decision with applause. Long road: The supermarket giant first applied to build a store in 1987 and after several attempts has still failed to get pernission . Andrew . Cann, spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, said: ‘It’s a victory for . the people of Hadleigh as it was simply going to destroy the high . street, and people come here because of the environment and the . independent stores.’ Tesco . has not ruled out appealing or putting in a new application, but Mrs . Byrne said local people have already got plans for the proposed site, a . plot of abandoned warehouses. She said: ‘People are dreaming about what would happen if Tesco would go away and let us buy the site. ‘The one thing we have not got is small retirement units for independent living for people who want to downsize.’ Tesco . said many Hadleigh residents had supported its project, which, it said, . would have brought jobs and more choice to the town. Tesco had planning applications rejected in 1987 and 2000. A government inquiry in 2001 rejected an appeal. In 2011 a further application was rejected.",

        "document": "When Jewish schoolgirl Helga Weiss was ordered off the train at Auschwitz in 1944, she was destined for death in the gas chambers - along with all the others considered too young or too old to work. But instead of being killed, Helga, not long in her teens, managed to convince 'Angel of Death' doctor Josef Mengele she was older and fit to work. Almost 70 years after she gave one of the most reviled Nazis the slip, the story of the Czech teenager - now a celebrated artist - . is to be told for the first time in a new book. Helga Weiss, pictured here during the war, was given hard labour instead of being gassed at Auschwitz after convincing Josef Mengele - the 'Angel of Death' - that she was 'fit to work' Helga Weissova-Hoskova, as she is now known, went on to become a famous artist in the Czech Republic . Mengele would hold the power of life and death over the Jews sent to the camp - sending the weakest off to the left and unwittingly into the gas chambers where they would meet their end. The strongest would go to the right for forced labour but survival. Although the other children were killed, Helga was spared by the SS officer, who sent her to a work camp. His snap decision saved her life, and at the end of the war she was freed. Miss Weiss, who went on to become a . famous artist in the Czech Republic, and is now in her 80s, will have her war memoirs . published around the world. She kept a diary jotted down in school . exercise books of her time spent in concentration camps during the war. Death camp: The main entrance to Auschwitz. Schoolgirl Helga Weiss managed to persuade Mengele to save her. The writing over the gate 'Arbeit macht frei' says 'work sets you free' As prisoners arrived at Auschwitz, notorious doctor Josef Mengele (pictured) would sort them - ushering the strongest to the right and the weakest to the left to their deaths. Those who were not fit for work - because they were not physically fit, were too young or too old - were sent to the gas chambers immediately. Historians have told harrowing stories of how he sentenced a block of 750 people to death when he discovered there was an outbreak of lice in their block. But although Mengele had the power of life and death over all the new arrivals, it was his grim experiments that gave him notoriety. He would amputate limbs, sterilise prisoners and give them shock therapy. Those who didn't die during surgery would be killed by infection or put to death. The sheer barbarity of his actions has made him one of the most infamous characters in Nazi Germany. But when the Third Reich fell in 1945 he escaped to South America and lived on until 1979. The book, Helga's Diary - sold to publishers at the Frankfurt book fair - has been likened to the diary of Anne Frank. It will come out in Britain next year. After persuading the death camp officer to save her, Miss Weiss moved back to her home city of Prague after the war. Although she found fame with her artwork, her war diaries were little known. Helga was sent to live in a ghetto by the Nazis in Terezin, Czechoslovakia, at the start of the diary which begins in 1939. She tells the story of her grim life - and how freedom was gradually curtailed before she was shipped off to Auschwitz with her mother in 1944. Helga - who is now married and uses the surname Weissova-Hoskova - told the Observer during a visit to London last year that life under the Nazis got progressively worse before she was shipped off to the death camp. 'One thing after another was forbidden: employees lost their jobs, we were banned from the parks, swimming pools, sports clubs. 'I was banned from going to school when I was 10,' she said. 'I was always asking my parents, \"What's happening?\", and became angry at them if I thought they were trying to hide something, to protect me.' She arrived at Auschwitz on October 4, 1944, where Dr Mengele was deciding who to kill and who should be given labour. After tricking the reviled doctor into thinking she was old enough to work, Helga was sent to Flossenbürg where she was forced to work. Of around 15,000 children from Terezin sent to Auschwitz, it is believe between 150 and 1,500 survived. Although Helga has admitted in the past that she kept a war journal, it had never been published before. Helga's Diary (published by Viking) is out on June 7 next year.

Nearly two thirds of children living in California are physically unfit, according to worrying new test results. Just 31 per cent of more than a million school pupils assessed by the state's education department were ranked in the 'healthy zone.' The shocking figures present California with a 'tremendous health challenge' the department's head, Tom Torlakson has warned. Unfit: Less than a third of children in California have been rated as 'physically fit' in tests conducted by the state's education department (file picture) The tests involved 1.3 million fifth, seventh and ninth-grade students from across the state. This is the second year in a row that youngsters in California have received poor fitness results in the tests. Fitness levels in the state had previously been found to be improving. 'When . we can call fewer than one out of three of our kids physically fit, we . know we have a tremendous public health challenge on our hands,' Mr . Torlakson, told the Los Angeles Times.

        "document": "A husband has been banned from having sex with his wife by a High Court judge because she does not know she can refuse his advances, it was revealed yesterday. The unidentified Bangladeshi man, who lives in east London, claimed he has the right under his Islamic culture to have sex with the mentally-disabled woman aged 39 whenever he pleases. He has already taken the wife's cousin as a second ‘wife’ in a polygamous Islamic marriage and had two children with her - although still demands the right to have sex with his first wife. Judgment: A judge at the High Court (pictured) in London said the man wanted his wife to come home so he could have sex with his two spouses on alternate days . But with a mental age of four to eight, the wife - identified only as ‘TB’ - has been taken into care under the Mental Health Act by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets where the family lived. All their four children have also been taken into care because she does not have the ability to care for them. But the husband - SA - married to her for 18 years, wanted her back home. A Family Division judge refused this in an anonymised judgment released yesterday. Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘The evidence clearly shows that TB has barely an inkling of the health risks involved. She was unable to link sex to pregnancy. ‘Indeed she had virtually no idea how her babies came to be in her tummy (as she put it). Although she found sex enjoyable and comfortable she had no idea that she had a choice and could refuse. ‘Indeed the attitude of SA, based, as he told me on his culture and religion, was that he had a right to seek sex from her and that it was her duty to submit.’ The judge said efforts to enlighten TB about sex, her rights, and the risks involved had failed. He added: ‘It is doubtful that TB has ever had the capacity to decide to have sex, notwithstanding that she has had four children.’ Important case: The wife - identified only as ‘TB’ - has been taken into care under the Mental Health Act by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (whose headquarters are pictured, centre) where the family lived . The couple had a ‘volatile’ relationship and there were instances of domestic violence when the husband lost his temper. After their elder children had been taken into care the judge said it was ‘heartless’ of the husband to make her pregnant again knowing the child would be taken away at birth. The judge said: ‘Sex is a, if not the, basic animal instinct. It is a very powerful instinct. Without it animal (or any) life would not exist. ‘Nature has made it intensely pleasurable in order to seek to ensure the propagation of the species. Most physically fit humans are mechanically capable of engaging in sex irrespective of their mental capacity. ‘Although it is a powerful instinct (I myself would not describe it as visceral) it still requires a positive choice and society demands that that choice is freely exercised by both parties. ‘Our modern society views with repugnance and amazement those barbarous relics that once said, for example, that a man can force sex on his wife.’ Her husband wanted her to come home so he could have sex with his two wives on alternate days, said the judge. He added: 'The right to family life is a qualified right and the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is in her best interests that she should live apart from SA. For this reason also it is necessary that SA's right to a family life is compromised.’ He also declared that she did not have the capacity to consent to sex and should be held in accommodation where she received 24-hour care, with the situation reviewed every six months. The judge said the polygamous marriage was valid under Islamic law but invalid in the UK.",

        "document": "By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:03 EST, 31 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:59 EST, 3 September 2012 . A Mexican street dance is putting a spring back in the step of British dementia patients. Twice-weekly sessions of Danzón, Latin ballroom-style dance, improved the mood and behaviour of care home residents. Processing and practising the simple-to-follow steps, enjoying the music and having fun with others also reduced apathy and agitation, both of which are usually treated with powerful drugs. People dance Danzon in the main square of Oaxaca, Mexico. Doing the steps improved the mood of care home residents in the UK . Researcher Guzmán García, who knew the dance from growing up in Mexico, said: ‘I found that these dance classes helped calm agitation and improved mood and quality of life for people with dementia. ‘There are also obvious advantages in terms of physical fitness. ‘I witnessed the joy people got from taking part in the dancing and for residents who were watching, the laughter and happy memories it generated.’ Danzón originated in England in the 17th century and was popular in Jane Austin’s era before becoming fashionable in France, Haiti and, finally, Latin America. It is still popular in Mexico today, with older adults in particular enjoying impromptu dance sessions on the streets. Staff at the Rosewood Villa Residential Home in Newcastle, said that the patients found the 30-minute sessions mentally stimulating and quickly became immersed in the activity. The classes, which formed part of Dr García’s PhD at Newcastle University, were so successful that carers now sometimes use a ‘little Danzón in the corridor’ to help patients unwind. Staff at the Rosewood Villa Residential Home in Newcastle said residents found the dance mentally stimulating . Mary Watson, the home’s owner, said: ‘We could see how much people enjoyed the dancing and it brought back some lovely memories which they were able to share with us of when they were younger. ‘We found that the men wanted to join in with the dancing and this is important to us as it can be harder to find activities that they want to take part in. ‘On the days when the dancing was on, the men made an effort to dress smartly and told us how they were looking forward to it which was really nice.’ Resident Hilda Dumbarton, 92 said: ‘I enjoy everything about the dancing.‘I was the youngest of a large family and most of us danced. I love dancing - I met my husband dancing and he was very good - it brings back happy memories.’ Dr Ian James, who supervised the study published in the journal Dementia, said: ‘The Danzón activity was enjoyed by both the residents and staff and improved the communication between the two groups. ‘Reductions in residents’ agitation and apathy were also seen, which is noteworthy because often these conditions are treated with medications known to have highly problematic side-effects.’ Dr García said: ‘I would encourage all care homes to consider structured and regular dance sessions because of the benefits it brings in terms of behaviour and social interaction which means it can be considered positive for dementia care.’",

The chat show host challenged Clarkson to a punch-up to settle their 14-year-long feud. Morgan, 48, said that the match would be in aid of Help For Heroes with the loser paying £100,000 to the Forces' charity. When Morgan was the editor of a tabloid newspaper he published pictures of Clarkson, 53, getting friendly with a female work colleague - after Clarkson had denied any wrongdoing. Four years later, Clarkson  punched Morgan at an awards ceremony in London. Recently, Clarkson teased Morgan on Twitter and in a newspaper after his CNN show Piers Morgan Live was by CNN. Feuding: Piers Morgan, left, was editing a newspaper when the feud with Jeremy Clarkson, right, began . However Morgan tweeted: ‘He talks a good game, let's see if @JeremyClarkson has the b***s to walk it too. £100k charity fight – yes or no, Fatboy?’ Clarkson refused to rise to the bait: ‘I'm not going to box Piers Morgan. I'm too busy’ later adding ‘Leave me alone. I’ve got a job to do.’ Morgan responded: ‘Cluck, cluck cluck.’ Jeremy Clarkson (right) and Piers Morgan on Concorde in 2003 . The battle between Piers Morgan and Jeremy Clarkson began in November 2000. Morgan was the editor of the Daily Mirror when he was sent a set of paparazzi photos showing Clarkson in an embrace with TV producer Elaine Bedell. Morgan rang Clarkson and offered a deal if Clarkson co-operated. Clarkson claimed Bedell was just a friend and, according to Morgan, added: ‘I’m not physically capable of having an affair. You can ask my wife.’ Morgan published the pictures anyway. Clarkson was not happy. In May 2002, at a wedding Clarkson and his wife Frances lay into Morgan for publishing the photos. Morgan apologised. Five months later, more photographs appeared of Clarkson and Bedell together and Clarkson again insisted they were innocent. A year later, Morgan and Clarkson were on the last flight of Concorde. Despite the fact that Clarkson told other passengers that Morgan ‘is a little ****’ and he was going to ‘punch his lights out,’ BA put Clarkson in the seat directly in front of Morgan. As Clarkson took his seat he said, ‘oh, ******* hell, I’ve got a **** behind me.’ ‘And I’ve got one in front of me, too,’ Morgan replied. Morgan taunted Clarkson: ‘Come on big man, show me what you’ve got.’ Clarkson then tipped a glass of water over Morgan. In March 2004, they both attended the British Press Awards. Clarkson swung at Morgan and hit his temple and forehead. The next day, Morgan announced: ‘I think it’s fair to say he was a little inebriated. I’ve frankly taken worse batterings from my three-year-old son.’ Clarkson admitted: ‘He’s won really. This is just one in a long line of clashes. We’ll have to kiss and make up.’ Clarkson, however, did the opposite. The following month, he appeared on Michael Parkinson’s TV show, and said: ‘I don’t get on with Piers Morgan, so I punched him,’ adding, ‘Every woman I meet asks me, “Why did you hit him?” And every man asks, “Where did you hit him?”’ In December 2012 in the wake of the shooting of 20 pupils and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Morgan called for a gun ban, leading pro-gun Americans to call for him to be deported from the U.S. On Christmas Eve Clarkson tweeted: ‘Americans. It took us 40 years to get rid of Piers Morgan. Please don’t send him back.’ Clarkson also tweeted repeatedly when Morgan had his nightly show dropped by CNN, then used one of his newspaper columns to launch a long attack on the host. If he had hoped to offend Morgan, he failed. 'Dear old @JeremyClarkson warned I wouldn't like what he's written about me tomorrow. I just read it, and LOVED IT! Quite fabulously b*tchy,' he Tweeted.",

        "document": "(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba muscled his way through for a late winner to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday. A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley. The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch, but Drogba's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies. Dutchman Hiddink, who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match, said Drogba had proved his worth again. \"He is proving already he is so dangerous, very strong and physically fit,\" he told Press Association. \"We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name.\" Arsenal went ahead in the 18th minute as Theo Walcott's volley deflected past Petr Cech, but Florent Malouda equalized for Chelsea just after the half hour mark. Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner. He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. \"He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day,\" Wenger said. \"Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly.\"",

        "document": "(CNN)  -- It was like Mary Pipher was on a runaway train of success. She had multiple best-selling books and was much in demand as a therapist and an inspirational speaker. And at one point in 2002, she felt like she had given all she could give, and she suffered a meltdown. She detailed the struggles in her life and her recovery in her latest book, \"Seeking Peace: Chronicles of the Worst Buddhist in the World.\" And in the wake of that book, she is sounding an alarm about danger of being a joyless \"constant working machine.\" \"If you ask anyone how they've been any more, they always say, 'busy,' \" Pipher said. \"I'm just stubborn enough that sometimes I say, 'You know, it's been really slow for me lately,' just to see people's shocked looks, because nobody in America ever says that anymore.\" Pipher, the author of \"Reviving Ophelia,\" an acclaimed book that examined the stresses and perils young girls face, took some time off to heal herself by just sitting and enjoying simple things like birdwatching and viewing sunsets. Now that she has slowed down, she's noticed how so many adults are living at a fast pace despite their feelings of being burdened, anxious and confused. She also fears that her too-busy country has developed what she calls \"a culture of anhedonia,\" or the lack of ability to feel pleasure and joy. \"People just are not laughing as much,\" Pipher said, adding that she rarely hears anyone walking around singing or whistling, like she did growing up. The psychologist says many people fault themselves for being too busy and think they just have to grab more control of their lives. Women put too many expectations on themselves: having a career, being physically fit, being in good relationships with family and friends, reading good literature, doing community work, recycling and buying green, and being involved in some sort of spiritual quest. And when they fail to accomplish all that in one day, she said, \"they go to sleep thinking, 'I didn't get done what I needed to, and somehow that is my fault.' \" Men are also heading down the path of feeling like a failure, as more of them share the \"second shift\" work of child care, cooking and cleaning at home. But the workplace hasn't shifted much to accommodate men who are more involved in their families, Pipher says. People's efforts to squeeze so much more work into the unchanging number of hours in a day has caused them to abandon the mammalian rhythms that \"we've operated on since the beginning of the human race.\" Breaking those natural rhythms, Pipher says, leads people to avoid eye contact as they tell themselves it might distract them from the busy and important work that they've got to rush to do. Also, moving too fast makes it difficult to see anything that isn't moving at the same speed, again leading to people not seeing each other. \"That's got to be some kind of enormous human tragedy on a cultural level,\" she noted. \"Our time famine is actually diminishing the quality of the human experience in a very serious way.\" Our too-frenetic lives also dulls our senses, she says, leading us to \"lose all capacity for joy, because joy comes from actually appreciating and being in the senses and being in the body.\" Pipher realizes that most people don't have the ability or the money to take an extended leave, like she did for about three months. But she says there are other ways they can slow down. The author says she has become a \"seeker of moments\": those times when you stop in your tracks and really pay attention to something beautiful or feel a connection to another person. She suggests ways others can capture such moments: . • Take part in any daily practice that allows for stillness and quiet, such as meditation, sitting and drinking a cup of tea, stopping to watch a sunset or just lying in bed and being aware of your breathing for five minutes every morning before getting up. • Make a gratitude list at the end of the day to remind you where there was joy, or something spontaneous or fun during the day. • Choose to make human connections by looking directly into the eyes of the barista taking your latte order, your coworker or your child's teacher or day care provider. • Set aside an area in your home -- a room or even a chair -- that is the quiet or calm spot. And any member of the family can go there and be undisturbed while they \"deal with their own inner architecture for a little while.\" • Turn off machines and live as close as possible to olden times by walking, talking or cooking with others. • Interact with pets. \"Dogs and cats move at the same speed in 2010 as they did in 1910,\" so there is a calmness in being with them, and they don't care if you're a high achiever or successful or well-paid.",

        "document": "It was the single most deadly day on the world's highest peak - 16 Sherpa guides were killed on Mount Everest when an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall on April 18. On that morning, just before 7am, mountaineer Joby Ogwyn was lying his tent 17,598 ft up the iconic peak at Base Camp when the unnerving, but a familiar sound of 'creaking and groaning' caused him to stick his head out and what he saw will haunt him forever. 'Within a couple of seconds it looked like this big white dragon, thunderously loud, moving at probably 200 miles an hour, straight toward our Sherpa, who were carrying some of our equipment up to a higher camp.' Scroll down for videos . Power: The aftermath of the avalanche that came down Mount Everest on April 18 that claimed the lives of 16 Sherpas . Deadly: The avalanche struck at the Khumbu Icefall, a treacherous passage between Base Camp and Camp 1 riddled with crevasses and columns of ice known as seracs . Ogwyn, 39, who was preparing to climb Everest and then become the first man to leap off the 29,029-foot summit in a wing suit for the Discovery Channel, watched as blocks of ice the size of cars and houses crashed down the slopes. Out of the 16 Sherpa's who died that day, three were working for Ogwyn and instead of a triumphant piece of television, the Discovery Channel crew found themselves witness to a dramatic rescue and recovery mission in the moments that followed. Aired on Sunday night, the revised special, Everest Avalanche Tragedy, showed harrowing footage from the scene, including the heart-breaking moment rescuers discovered the leg of Sherpa, Dorjee Khatri, poking out the huge icy fall. 'I looked outside and saw the avalanche coming down,' Ogwyn recalled according to the LA Times. 'Everyone got wiped out that I could see.' Rush to help: Cameras from the Discovery production crew witness the frantic attempts to reach those affected by the avalanche . Ice blocks the size of houses: The avalanche's power is appreciated when the helpless mountaineers are seen in comparison with the displaced ice . Despite not being in the deadly path, Ogwyn knew then and there that his wing suit adventure would not happen. 'We were just doing all we could do to find our guys and get their dead bodies off the mountain,' he said. 'We were trying to reach our guys by radio, but we couldn't get anyone on the radio,' an emotional Ogwyn recalled to the LA Times. 'Within an hour we knew they were dead. They'd found some pieces of equipment that had literally gotten blown off the guys. Boots and backpacks.' At Base Camp, Ogwyn and the Discovery Channel production crew were around a half-mile from the avalanche and they instantly tried to contact his Sherpa guide team. When they received no response, they immediately feared the worst. Emotional: Joby Ogwyn watched the avalanche from his tent as it began to tumble down the slopes of Mount Everest on April 18 . Recovery: Joby Ogwyn said that it dawned on everyone very quickly that this would not be a rescue mission . The powerful and emotional Discovery special revealed the moment that one survivor was found buried waist deep, battered and bloody from ice as heavy as blocks of concrete. Others were simply entombed in the ice. 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' Ogwyn said to zap2it.com. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Ogwyn rushed towards the disaster zone and because of his peak physical fitness was able to make the climb in only one hour - for others it would have taken much longer. 'I knew this was going to be bad,' he said, admitting he knew this was a recovery mission, not a rescue. In tears during the Discovery special, Ogwyn explained how he saw a helicopter airlift the tragic dead away from the scene wrapped in sleeping bags or tents. Harrowing: The leg of Dorjee Khatri is visible in this tragic grab from Discovery's Everest Avalanche Tragedy which aired on Sunday evening . So sad: Bodies were airlifted away from the disaster zone wrapped in sleeping bags or tents . 'I sat there and watched the whole thing,' he said to Zap2It.com. 'They found body after body.' There were three Sherpas working for Ogwyn Discovery and Peacock Productions - Dorjee Khatri, Dorjee Sherpa and Phur Temba Sherpa —  but the mountaineer knew all 16. Respecting their reputation as the world's greatest climbers, Ogwyn specially requested those three to help carry the heavy filming equipment. 'I knew they would appreciate what I was trying to do,' he said. During his two decades climbing the world's tallest peaks, Ogwyn had witnessed many avalanches, but nothing like this. On Everest, everything is bigger and when a glacier breaks, 'it buries people like concrete buries the,.' 'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' said Ogwyn. 'It had been there for millions of years.' Confirmation: The documentary from Discovery showed how the disaster unfolded in real time and how the production team who were there for a wing suit record attempt quickly found themselves organizing a recovery mission . During the course of the Discovery special, the build up to the moment of the avalanche was replayed, including interviews with Ogwyn, expedition leader Garrett Madison and additional members of the expedition and production teams. 'It's heartbreaking,' said a still-shaken Ogwyn. 'I've been climbing in the Himalayas for the past 15 years and forged a friendship with a lot of these guys. I'm shell-shocked by this. Everyone is.' The network also announced they are to donate to the American Himalayan Foundation Sherpa Family Fund, which helps the families of the deceased. Ogwyn is still reeling from the accident and told Reuters that the, 'Hardest job in the world to go rescue your dead buddies off that mountain and that’s exactly what everybody came together to do that that day. Highest peak on Earth: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable . Khumbu Icefall: More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Everest's summit since it was first climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. The route they took along the South Col was the one hit by the avalanche . Star of the show: The Discovery Channel live jump was going to be done by Joby Ogwyn, an experienced wingsuiter, and the special was announced in February . 'So it’s a really powerful story and it needs to be told. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to watch it. My heart’s broken and I’ll never, ever get over it.' However, while his attempt to jump off Everest in his specially designed wing suit has been postponed, he is now focusing on helping the families of the dead Sherpas. 'I think what people don't realize is how much the Sherpas enjoy their jobs,' he said. 'They are far from slaves.' 'My goal went from climbing and jumping off the mountain to raising money for the families,' Ogwyn said. He wants those willing to donate money to visit The Sherpa Family Fund, where 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the victims families. 'We were at Mt. Everest to make history, but instead we were there as eyewitnesses to history,' said Eileen O'Neill, Group President, Discovery, Science and Velocity Networks. Deadly force: The avalanche that killed at least thirteen sherpas is pictured as it barrels down Mount Everest . No hope of survival: Rescuers on Mount Everest found the body of a 13th Nepalese guide buried under snow as authorities ruled out hope of finding any more survivors from the deadliest accident ever on the world's highest peak . Indeed, in the aftermath of the disaster, the Sherpas have refused to climb, citing poor conditions and a lack of respect from the Nepal Government, who make millions each year from climbing permits. Conversely, when a Sherpa dies their family receives $400. 'I think it's their right to,' said Ogwyn of the Sherpas' strike. 'It's very fresh in their minds... But life goes on. It's going to be pretty hard for a lot of guys to make a living if they don't want to work, including myself. 'I don't want to find something else to do and I think a lot of Sherpas in that region take a lot of pride in what they do. 'Everybody, Western people and Sherpa, needed to take some time to let this sink in and go away a little bit before we start planning the next season on Everest.' Nepalese mountain rescue workers lifting an injured climber after an avalanche came down on Mt. Everest. Authorities called off the rescue operation for survivors after 13 Nepali climbing guides were killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest, as bad weather closed in . Final resting place: Group of family members of the  Nepalese mountaineer carry the body of Ang Kaji Sherpa, who died on Mt. Everest Avalanche upon its arrival   at Sherpa Monastry in Kathmandu . On Wednesday, family members, mountaineers and government officials gathered in Nepal's capital Wednesday for a memorial service for the 16 Nepalese Sherpa guides killed in avalanche on Mount Everest. They offered flower garlands and lit candles and incense in front of the photographs of the 16 Sherpa guides who died in the April 18 avalanche. The 13th day after death is the customary end of mourning and the day when Nepalis generally hold memorials. 'We are still disappointed at the government, which has done little for the family members. The help they have given is a joke, like giving money to a beggar. The state should take care of the families of the dead,' said Pasang Doma, who lost her brother in the avalanche. While 13 bodies have been recovered, the three others are buried under heavy snow and ice. Most of the expedition teams have left the mountain while the rest are packing their bags and gear in the base camp. The avalanche was the deadliest disaster on the world's highest mountain. It was triggered when a massive piece of glacier sheared away from the mountain along a treacherous section of constantly shifting ice and crevasses known as the Khumbu Icefall, marked by overhanging ice as big as office buildings.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Luke Cox used to be an athlete. But a year ago, no one would have called him that. The 31-year-old high school social studies teacher and coach weighed about 415 pounds and was too big and tired at the end of the day to get on the floor and play with his kids. At 6 foot 5, Cox was wearing 5XL T-shirts and size 50 jeans. He couldn't stop eating. His mornings began with two breakfast sandwiches and two jelly doughnuts. At night, Cox ate candy and stole the snacks his kids, then 2, 3 and 5 years old, were supposed to take to school the next day. The junk food binges put a strain on his body, the family's food budget and his relationships. \"Here I was teaching students and athletes discipline and hard work when I had none myself,\" the Missouri dad wrote in on CNN iReport. \"I would come home after practice and ignore my wife and young children and sit in front on the TV and fall asleep there.\" Luke Cox: In his own words . His wife, Rudy, remembers him saying, \"I just don't know where to start. So I'm not going to.\" She would ask him to take a walk with her, and he would say, \"That's pointless. Where am I walking to?\" Rudy had heard about a 12-week weight-loss challenge beginning that March, hosted by Kansas City Fitness Magazine. On January 11, 2013, she e-mailed a \"wife's plea\" to admit her husband. \"Please give him a chance and help him to save his life,\" she wrote. \"Luke is everything to our family.\" The program, similar to \"The Biggest Loser\" TV show, provided 30 contestants with licensed trainers, gym memberships, nutrition counseling, life coach sessions, weekly weigh-ins and weekends at an \"accountability ranch.\" The 10 people with the greatest weight loss percentage won a makeover and a feature in the magazine. Participants were asked to raise a $600 entry fee from family and friends as a way to stay accountable. \"I didn't like that at first. I felt uncomfortable asking people to pay for my mistake,\" Cox said. But it was effective. \"If people were willing to do that, I didn't want to let them down.\" The competition gave Cox the motivation he had been looking for, but he was at a disadvantage. Living in Tarkio, Missouri, a small town 2Â½ hours from Kansas City, he couldn't make use of the licensed physical trainers, state-of-the-art gyms and group workouts that the other contestants had access to. That only made him more determined. \"I had this chip on my shoulder. I didn't have the trainers that they did; I didn't have the gyms they got to work out in,\" he said. He thought to himself, \"I'll show you guys I'm not some country bumpkin.\" Cox, who managed to lose a few pounds on his own before the competition began, asked Ty Ratliff, the local elementary school gym teacher and a fellow coach, to be his trainer. They did high-intensity interval workouts and sprints three, and then four, times a week using the high school gym, weight room and track, and a local recreation center. It was a new challenge for Ratliff, who was used to bulking kids up as the weight-training teacher and head high school football coach. \"Usually, our goal is to get kids bigger, faster and stronger. Here, we were doing the opposite: taking pounds off Luke,\" Ratliff said. \"We wanted to him to get stronger ... but we were really focused on the cardiovascular aspect.\" Cox never skipped a workout. At the same time, he overhauled his diet. He weaned himself off soda and made sure he was getting lots of lean protein. For breakfast, he ate three hard-boiled eggs and Greek yogurt. Lunch was a spinach salad with 2 ounces of shaved turkey. For dinner, he ate grilled chicken or fish. He prepared his meals the night before and wouldn't eat anything that wasn't in his Nebraska Cornhuskers lunchbox. \"I left my wallet at home so I couldn't go to the school snack machine. I didn't eat with my fellow teachers in the cafeteria because I knew I would want to eat the cafeteria food. I ate in my room by myself. Once I gained enough confidence in myself, I began to eat with them and I brought my wallet to school without going to the snack machine,\" he wrote in his iReport. His small town of about 1,600 people was a big source of encouragement. \"One morning, I bought some victory doughnuts for my basketball team. The clerk at the convenience store reminded me that I was trying to lose weight and that I didn't need those,\" he said. \"I told her that I appreciated her concern and that they were a surprise for my team. That is what is great about a small town.\" The hard work paid off: He ended up winning the competition. In 12 weeks, he dropped from 396 to 316 pounds, a 20.2% loss in body weight, and got the biggest feature in the July/August Kansas City Fitness Magazine. He has another profile in the magazine this month. And he kept going. He recently bought his first XL T-shirt since freshman year of college and ran his first 5K. He now weighs 283 pounds and would like to get down to 265 or 270. \"I know with my frame, I'm always going to be a big guy, but I want to be a strong, physically fit guy,\" he said. \"I'll never go back, because I know how hard I've worked to change that.\" The transformation has changed his whole family. Instead of watching TV together, they go to the rec center five days a week as a family. Cox comes home now and cooks for his wife and kids, goes for bike rides with them and jumps on the trampoline. Though his kids are still quite young -- 3, 4 and 6 -- he's apologized to them for being so big and not having as much fun with them as a dad should have. \"He's full of energy now. ... He's a totally different person,\" wife Rudy said. \"In their eyes, they have their dad back.\"",

        "document": "Hiking! Zip-lining! Rock climbing! About 30,000 Boy Scouts and 7,000 adults are out in the mountains of southern West Virginia for the National Scouts Jamboree -- and they all had to meet a body mass index cut-off. The Boy Scouts of America mandated that no one -- adult or child -- with a BMI of 40 or above could be accepted into the Jamboree, which is taking place July 15-24. This standard is not new; it was in place for the last jamboree as well, said Deron Smith, director of public relations for Boy Scouts of America. \"This policy is not meant to keep anyone out at all, and it's just to make sure that they're safe,\" Smith said. \"We offer thousands of summer camp experiences (that) do not have this requirement.\" The Boy Scouts' healthy living initiative has inspired children and adults alike to lose weight, Smith said. The association is encouraging people to live a healthy lifestyle. But that's not how some see it. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, a nonprofit organization, has come out against the Boy Scouts' BMI policy, saying that the organization \"believes that this decision promotes bias and negative attitudes and furthers the discrimination against boys of larger body size.\" The organization publicly demanded in a statement that the Boy Scouts \"reconsider their discriminatory practices and admit camp attendees NOT based on their physical fitness, NOT based on their body size, but based on their active status as a boy scout.\" Most who could not meet the BMI requirement chose not to apply, Smith said. The organization does not know the number of children impacted. The Boy Scouts have not received any reactions from parents on the BMI issue, he said. For prospective participants who have a slightly lower BMI than 40, but are still obese, there are also special requirements for the jamboree, according to the Boy Scouts' website. The jamboree's medical staff needs a health history, health data and a recommendation from a personal health care provider for children with a BMI between 32 and 39.9, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers to be in the \"obese\" range. How to fix health problems with exercise . Even if the personal health care provider says there aren't any contraindications for participating, that doesn't necessarily mean a person in this BMI range will be able to participate in the whole program, the Boy Scouts' website says. People with a BMI of 31.9 or less need a medical recommendation, too, but don't receive the additional health scrutiny. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta and CNN's Living Well expert, said she found the restrictions on children with a BMI of over 40 to be somewhat discriminatory. \"Any organization can make their own rules, but as a pediatrician I feel like we should be promoting physical activity for everybody, be as inclusive as possible, and only exclude from activity if there's a physical threat to their health,\" she said. On the other hand, she noted that in some summer programs there are physical activities involving equipment that has a weight or size limit for safety reasons. That should be a restrictive factor for those particular activities, she said, because of the danger to a participant who doesn't meet the requirements. BMI is not a perfect indicator of health and fitness; a BMI of 40 means that the person's weight is much higher than average for his or her height. Muscle can elevate BMI, so some fit people have higher BMIs than normal. Physicians group labels obesity a disease . A BMI as high as 40 is unlikely to be mostly muscle, Shu said, but if there are health issues preventing that person from participating, she believes a doctor should determine that, rather than an organization making a blanket requirement. Shu doesn't look at BMI alone when filling out medical forms for children to participate in summer programs. In addition to evaluating the kids' health, she asks children how they perceive their own abilities in specific activities, such as rock climbing, and doesn't give permission for anything with which the child doesn't feel comfortable. The focus of the jamboree is not on the health requirements, Smith said. \"Our motto is: Be prepared,\" Smith said. \"We're the Boy Scouts. We've been preparing our participants for years for this.\" Shu offered a different perspective: \"In general, we'd like to encourage physical activity for everybody.\" In her view, that's something the Scouts are not honoring.

        "document": "A widow whose husband was killed courageously fighting a wildfire in Yarnell, Arizona five weeks ago is being denied the lifetime benefits she was counting on to raise the couple's four young children alone. Juliann Ashcraft's husband, Andrew, was one of 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighters who lost their lives when a fire they were battling suddenly changed direction and engulfed them. Mr Ashcraft, like his colleagues, was protecting the people of Yarnell when he died, tragically leaving his young family without a husband, father or income. But the city of Prescott, where the Hotshots were based, is now claiming he was a seasonal worker, despite him working a 40 hour week year round, and denying Mrs Ashcraft full benefits. Scroll down for video . Confused: Juliann Ashcraft, pictured, is fighting with the city of Prescott for the benefits she is being denied . Children: Mrs Ashcraft, pictured, was left to raise her four children alone . 'As shocked as I was that my husband . went to work and never came home, I'm equally shocked in how the city . has treated our family since then,' Mrs Ashcraft, whose youngest child . is just 18 months old, told CBS News. All 19 Hotshot families will receive worker's compensation and a one-off federal payment of $328,000. But . the city is refusing to pay Mrs Ashcraft her husband's lifetime salary . and health benefits, which together are worth millions, because it . insists he was among 13 of the squad who were seasonal employees rather . than full-timers. Only six of the 19 firefighters are entitled to full-time benefits, the city claims. 'I . said to them, \"My husband was a full-time employee, he went to work . full-time for you,\"' she said, 'and their response to me was, \"Perhaps . there was a communication issue in your marriage.\"' CBS . News has seen paperwork showing Mr Ashcraft did infact earn a full-time . salary as a firefighter for the city of Prescott. He was the only one . of the 13 Hotshots denied full benefits who worked a 40 hour week . through out the year. In love: Juliann, right, is pictured with Andrew Ashcraft, left, in happier times . Heartbreaking: Not only was Juliann Ashcraft, pictured, devastated to lose her husband, she is now facing raising their four children without the benefits she is entitled to . In a statement to CBS News, Prescott . officials said the city had 'fully complied with all of the laws and . employment polices that direct survivor benefits.' But . Mrs Ashcraft, still mourning the loss of her 29-year-old hero, is . desperate for help, as the costs associated with bringing up four . children mount. 'Quite . literally, my bills are being paid by the good people of the world who . are giving donations, because the city of Prescott isn't doing anything . for us,' she told the TV station. 'Now I have four kids and myself, and I . don't know what I'm going to do. 'I want to be able to just be mourning my husband, be supporting my children, be figuring out what our new normal is.' The . shocking treatment comes five weeks after the mother-of-four learned by . watching the news that her firefighter husband had perished in the . intense blaze that burned scores of homes to the ground. Just days after the men's deaths, Mrs . Ashcraft revealed the last conversation she had with her husband - and . her fears when he never responded to her text messages. Heartbroken: Juliann Ashcraft, cries alongside her father Tom Ashcraft outside of the Granite Mountain Hotshot fire station in Prescott on Monday July 1 . Struggle: Juliann Ashcraft, left, will only get a one-off payment of $328,000 and workers' compensation . Mrs . Ashcraft sobbed as she recounted the bravery of her beloved husband and . his close unit of highly-trained 'hotshot' colleagues, who were overcome . by the ferocious flames in Yarnell. She . said she had been texting her husband throughout the day - with him . telling her how much he loved and missed her, and how proud he was of . their young children - until he abruptly stopped. 'I . asked, \"Will you be sleeping out there tonight?\"' she told the Today . show early last month as she struggled to hold back the tears. 'And of . course there was no reply and they all laid out there that night.' She . added that she had been sending him pictures of their children swimming . that day, and how his daughter had commented that she wished he was . there to see the thunder storm with them. He responded that he wished for that too. 'We could sure use some rain over here,' he said. Mr . Ashcraft also sent his wife a picture of their view of the smoke and . flames from his team's lunch spot on Sunday, and Juliann said that she . was not particularly concerned when she saw it. Final moments: Mrs Ashcraft shared the final image Andrew Ashcraft texted her before the 19 firefighters were killed by the flames . An honorary flagpole is shown at the site where the 19 firefighters died . The devastation has been described as a 'moonscape' after an inferno so intense that only the metal part of one chain saw was found . 'It still did not look as catastrophic as it turned out to be,' she said. 'But he let us know that he loved us and missed us. Because of the dangers of the job, he would always tell us that he loved us.' Family photographs reveal a picture . perfect family as Juliann and Andrew are seen grinning and kissing, as . well as laughing along with their four young children. She told the Today show how, apart from his family, fighting fires with the Granite Mountain Hotshots was his life. 'He . was the most amazing man,' she said. 'The best person I know. A . contagious smile, a heart of gold. That's why he did what he did, . because he want to protect the community where he lived.' Of . his team, she added: 'They loved what they did. These men lived . together. They fought fires together. They died together - doing what . they loved.' On July 1, the day after the men were killed, Mrs Ashcraft was pictured distraught at a makeshift . memorial in Prescott for the fallen firefighters. She said she . learned of her husband's death while watching the news with their four children. 'They died heroes,' she told azcentral.com as she wept. 'And we'll miss them. We love them.' Prescott . High School physical education teacher and coach Lou Beneitone taught . many of the Hotshots, and remembered Ashcraft as a fitness-oriented . student. 'He had some . athletic ability in him and he was a go-getter, too. You could pretty . much see, from young freshman all the way, he was going to be physically . active.' Engulfed: 19 firefighters died as the wildfire spread near the Arizona town of Yarnell . Beneitone said . athletic prowess was a must for the Hotshots. 'That's what it takes. You . gotta be very physically fit, and you gotta like it, gotta like the . hard work.' Ashcraft, a . member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was honored . to be a member of the Hotshot crew, and 'he just had a really sweet . spirit about him,' Elise Smith, a Prescott, Arizona, resident, told The . Deseret News of Salt Lake City. As the bodies of the . Granite Mountain Hotshots were recovered, it emerged that the team's . 20th member survived as he was moving the crew's truck when the flames . overcame his comrades. Helicopters had been unable to reach the highly-trained men as they fought the flames in Yarnell and they could not be saved by their emergency shelters - tent-like structures meant to shield them from flames . and heat. When they were found on Sunday, all 19 . shelters were deployed but some of the men's bodies were inside their . individual shelters, while others were outside - indicating just how . suddenly they were overcome by the flames. 'It had to be a perfect storm in order . for this to happen,' Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward told the Today show last month. President Obama . called the firefighters heroes and highly skilled professionals who 'put . themselves in harm's way to protect the lives and property of fellow . citizens they would never meet.' The highly-skilled team was overtaken by a . fast-moving blaze stoked by hot winds on Sunday. The fire was sparked by a lightning strike on Friday and spread to at least 8,400 acres amid triple-digit temperatures, low humidity and . windy conditions. Death toll: The Yarnell wildfire is the deadliest wildfire involving firefighters in the U.S. for at least 30 years . The fire has also destroyed an estimated 200 homes. Dry grass . near the communities of Yarnell and Glen Isla fed the fast-moving . blaze. It . was unclear exactly how the crew became trapped. Southwest incident . team leader Clay Templin said the team and its commanders were following . safety protocols, but it appears the fire's erratic nature simply . overwhelmed them. At the . time, Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo said the 19 firefighters were a . part of the city's fire department. With their deaths, the department . lost 20 per cent of its members. 'We . grieve for the family. We grieve for the department. We grieve for the . city,' he said at a news conference on June 30. 'We're devastated. We just lost 19 of the finest people you'll ever meet.' Hot shot crews are elite firefighters . who often hike for miles into the wilderness with chain saws and . backpacks filled with heavy gear to build lines of protection between . people and fires. They remove brush, trees and anything that might burn . in the direction of homes and cities. The crew killed in the blaze had been working on other wildfires in recent weeks in New Mexico and Arizona, Fraijo said.",

For others, left cold by carols and gift wrap, urgings to \"be of good cheer\" can be devilishly hard to escape. Hard, that is, if you stick to your holiday routine. But what if you leave it all behind? Plenty of small-group escorted tours are still taking bookings for December, and if you're a solo traveler it's especially easy to snap up an available spot. Whether you're constitutionally immune to the holiday spirit, or just not feeling it this year, a few new faces and jingle-bell-free surroundings are bound to give you a boost. Here's a sampling of tours with open spaces for 2013, as of this writing -- some with last-minute deals for travel in the coming weeks. Around Turkey in 12 days . The real St. Nick hailed from Anatolia, the Asian portion of modern-day Turkey, which is nothing at all like the North Pole. The Christmas Turkey tour drops in on the saint's home town as well as some of the country's biggest draws, including the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, the \"fairy chimneys\" of Cappadocia and the shores of Gallipoli. From $1,899, not including international airfare, visa, entrance fees, and tips. December 18-29; 1-866-377-6147. Sand, Sea and Souks .

The Best of Morocco tour visits the exotic cities of Fez and Marrakech, as well as Roman ruins at Volubilis. It will also have you trekking by camel to stay in a Berber desert camp and admiring the ocean in Essaouira. From $1,279, not including international airfare, visa, departure transfer, most lunches and dinners, and tips. December 23-January 6;1-855-444-9110. Rivers and temples . Ready for a change of pace? You'll find it in more ways than one on the Laos & Cambodia Explorer tour floating slowly down the Mekong River. Witness daily life in Laos' Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that blends traditional Lao and colonial French architecture; fly on to Cambodia to tour the legendary Angkor temples. $2,874 with promo code (given on website); does not include international flights, visa, meals other than breakfast, or tips. December 21-January 3; 1-800-663-5132. Mayan Mystique . This tour of the Yucatán Peninsula starts and ends in Cancún, but its focus lies in culture, not cabanas.

        "document": "By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:50 EST, 19 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 20 January 2013 . Reader: Joanna Trollops believes being able to read should be a given, not a privilege . As leading author Joanna Trollope helps the Duchess of Cornwall launch the Children’s Reading Fund, she argues that illiteracy is probably the worst affliction that can befall a child other than abuse. They aim to raise £2 million to make access to books a right – not a luxury. Most of us have a nostalgic picture of the ideal bedtime story session – the clean, drowsy children, safe within the circle of a reading parent’s arm, a picture book, a comforting adult voice, the seductive fascination of narrative. But, sadly, that idyllic picture – even if it ever universally existed  – is no longer the case. Even if there is time, in modern families with two working parents, for such an idealised ritual, the shocking fact is that hundreds of thousands of children couldn’t take part in a bedtime story session – because they can’t read well enough, or worse, at all. For those of us who have read comfortably and easily from a young age, this is an appalling state of affairs – especially in this apparently sophisticated age. I suppose – and I bet I am far from alone – I have always taken reading for granted. From those early years with a torch under the bedclothes – Tess Of The D’Urbervilles and Jane Eyre all night long when I was about 13 – to right now, when I never go anywhere without something to read, and regard it as being as natural and necessary as breathing. It isn’t just that reading enables me to do my job – writing novels – but it also means that I can travel, shop, drive, communicate, enlighten and amuse myself, be alone, learn and develop. Those gifts, vital to a mentally healthy and satisfying life, are exactly what too many children growing up in care or in households without books are being deprived of. And, more tragically, the awareness of what reading and narrative mean to an even halfway good life. You could say that my children and grandchildren were privileged, growing up as they did and do in houses full of books with parents who actively encourage reading and set an example by constantly reading themselves. Indeed, I read to my grandchildren now out of their parents’ old books, held together by crackly strips of ancient Sellotape – Richard Scarry and Tove Jansson are particular favourites – but my point is that such a situation should not be one of privilege. Invaluable: Trollope says we must learn to love books when young . It should be the norm. Reading, for every child in this supposedly civilised country, should be an absolute given. There is a horrible statistic. I’m going to give it to you because it illustrates the problem so vividly. It is this. If you are a child in care, or even being fostered, in the UK in 2013, you have a greater chance of ending up in prison than in further education. And so much of that frightening danger is attributable to illiteracy. Children being moved from household to household and institution to institution never get the consistency of attention to learn to read. Too often, they are in communities where there is no place for books, no time to be taught and helped to read. They have no opportunity to discover the infinite comfort and companionship of books and stories, let alone the chances in life that being able to read gives you – and which not being able to read shuts you out of, for ever. I don’t think it’s at all helpful to blame anyone. This situation has arisen, as so much of modern life has arisen, from people reacting to the way things are, the way things have become. But that doesn’t mean that we should accept, for a nanosecond, that illiteracy is just one of those things. It is probably the worst affliction that can befall a deprived modern child, after actual abuse. Are we proud to live in a society where nearly a quarter of our 16-year- olds have a reading age of nine? It isn’t just their inevitably diminished lives that matter, but the effect on all the thousands of other people whom their lives and reduced capacities will impact on, in their lifetimes. To help this vital cause is to insure for a better future for countless people. So when you next think that you are too busy – or too distracted by the pressures of our modern obsession with perpetual communication – to give time to helping your child to read, or to read with one who needs encouragement to persist, or even just wants a reading companion, think again. What would your life be like if you couldn’t read? Well – it IS like that. For hundreds and thousands of our children. Right now. And it needn’t be. The Children’s Reading Fund is specifically targeting children in care and children in poverty. There can be no better way out of these miserable situations than giving these children the best possible tool to help themselves. And being able to read is that tool. Not a luxury, not a privilege, but a basic human right. Wouldn’t you say?",

        "document": "By . Sarah Vine . Boxing Day: Alka- Seltzer, leftovers and bored children. That faint feeling of self-loathing that comes from having spent too much money on things you didn't need or want. The Christmas manicure that looked so witty is now tawdry and chipped by washing up. The unmistakeable throb of a nascent spot on your chin. Bloat. My solution is to banish husband and children to the nearest park/ multiplex/football game and embark on my annual post-festive purge. Sarah Vine brings you something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013. Behind the fridge, the oven, the cupboard under the sink: nothing will escape my rubber gloves and bleach. And if I'm feeling really brave, I'll slip into my bio-hazard suit and tackle my daughter's bedroom. A clean house equals a clear mind, and there's no better way to see in the New Year. That said, I do realise most people will think I'm mad. So, for those of you who will be spending today curled up on the sofa with the remnants of a family-sized box of Celebrations, here's something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013. The year began, as it so often does, with a new diet. Popularised by an episode of TV's Horizon and the Mail's hugely successful 2-Day Diet, it involved adopting a reduced calorie intake on two out of seven days. Miley Cyrus, pictured here at the Jingle Ball 2013, brought twerking to the mainstream, much to most of our dismay . The benefits are bountiful: lowered cholesterol, lower blood pressure, regulation of blood sugar, improved mental clarity, focus and concentration. Oh, and weight loss, which, let's face it, is all we really care about. Best of all, though, was the relative ease and simplicity of the thing. After all, everyone can stay off chocs for a day at a time; it's doing it for weeks on end that's hard. So, while we all bored each other senseless with details of our new regime, a truly terrible portrait of Kate Middleton was unveiled to provide a little light relief. Write caption here . Somehow artist Paul Emsley made our radiant Duchess look as if she'd been pulling night shifts in a dust factory. The royal couple were polite about it; not so the critics, who professed themselves truly impressed by the way Emsley had managed to turn one of the world's most beautiful women into an old bag. One for the vaults, I fear. At the Baftas in February, some men turned up in beards, causing a frenzy and eliciting endless column inches about the 'return of facial hair'. Granted, those men included George Clooney, Ben Affleck and Hugh Jackman; but 'man grows beard' is not exactly a new story. Meanwhile, Dame Helen Mirren dyed her hair pink, an uncharacteristic lapse of taste for which we have yet to receive an explanation. Nigella leaving court earlier this month - her immaculate makeup makes her Sarah Vine's beauty heroine of the year . Even more baffling was Cheryl Cole's decision to get an entire rosebush tattooed on her behind. But then Jesse J shaved her head, Katherine Jenkins ran a marathon in full make-up, Gwyneth Paltrow forgot to wear her pants at the Iron Man premiere and Kate Moss turned up to a party in not much more than her tights - and Cole's bottom rose seemed tame by comparison. Fad-wise, this year there were plenty. There was the vampire facial, involving blood and needles; teeth grilles (as worn by Rihanna and, less plausibly, Madonna); selfies (photographs of one's perfect body snapped in the mirror of from the perspective of the sun lounger); belfies (a selfie from behind); twerking; and extreme waxing, the latter two pioneered in eye-watering detail by pop star Miley Cyrus. Selfies (as demonstrated by Maria Fowler of TOWIE, left) and tattoos (right, Cheryl Cole's enormous rose artwork) were big celebrity trends of 2013 . As PREDICTED, Kate Middleton gave birth to a baby and then promptly alienated half the female population by 'snapping back' into shape. Luckily she redeemed herself a few weeks later by stepping out on an official visit with - gasp! - grey roots, which was either an act of PR genius or a genuine oversight. Either way, a triumph. The year ended on a beauty high: the release of make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury's new cosmetic range, which saw Selfridges' beauty hall mobbed by women desperate to get their hands on Kate Moss's lipstick and J-Lo's cheek-contouring palette. Not since the launch of Tom Ford's make-up line (which was also devised by Tilbury) have cosmetics been this exciting - and with one advantage: her eyeshadows don't cost £64. But for all Tilbury's genius, the beauty triumph of 2013 was Nigella Lawson's court face. From Helen Mirren's pink hair, to Madonna's ill-advised grilles, we bring you the best and worst of this year's beauty trends . Doubtless the experience of having her marital laundry aired in public was deeply unpleasant. But never has a woman looked so utterly fabulous under pressure. Let's not forget that before she became the queen of cupcakes, she wrote about beauty for a newspaper. If she ever tires of cooking, there's always lipstick. My prediction for 2014? A Nigella make-up line. Stranger things have happened.",

A bomb squad found containers of frozen urine in the vehicle of man who police said lunged at an airport officer with a knife and was fatally shot. The suspicious material was confirmed as urine after the confrontation on Wednesday at Port Columbus International Airport, said the local police union leader, Jason Pappas. It's not clear why the man had the containers. Investigators said he had tried unsuccessfully to buy an airline ticket using a woman's ID, then got into the fatal confrontation with airport police after returning to his illegally parked vehicle. Police identified the man as 41-year-old Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed, of Columbus. No one answered the door on Thursday at a Hillard address listed for him. Police were investigating the man's background and why he was using a woman's ID. After the first shots were fired, he got up and headed back toward the terminal, and a second airport officer shot him, Columbus police Sgt. Rich Weiner said. He was shot multiple times. Pappas said three officers were involved in the confrontation. He said two uniformed airport officers approached the man, and one struggled with him and fired before retreating, at which point a detective came out of the airport and fired at the attacker. Abdul-Rasheed had multiple knives on him, police said. The first officer who fired suffered scrapes and bruises, but the police weren't seriously hurt, Pappas said. Scroll down for video . Members of the bomb squad check out a parked SUV at port Columbus Airport on Wednesday. A man who tried to buy an airline ticket using a fake ID was fatally shot after returning to his illegally parked car, where he lunged at an airport police officer with a knife . The officers will be on administrative leave for at least two days and will have counseling with a police psychologist, per standard procedure, he said. Columbus city police are handling the investigation. They have not released surveillance video that is expected to show what happened. Court records in Cuyahoga County show Abdul-Rasheed was indicted in Cleveland in 1999 on charges including attempted murder, aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery - all with firearms specifications. The court determined he was mentally ill subject to involuntary hospitalization and found him not guilty by reason of insanity in June 2000. He was committed to the maximum security unit of a psychiatric facility in Dayton. He remained under court supervision for more than a decade, transitioning to a different behavioral health care facility, then a group home with full-time supervision in 2002, semi-supervised housing and eventually independent living. His commitment ended in December 2012, and the case was closed. Emergency vehicles converge at Port Columbus International Airport after officials said an airport police officer shot and killed a man after a confrontation on Wednesday . County records indicate the same defendant had been convicted of attempted felonious assault in 1995 under a plea deal. His five-to-10 year prison sentence was suspended, and he was put on probation and sentenced to community service and counseling. Online court records don't indicate details of the crimes, and calls seeking more information from a division of the court clerk's office rang unanswered Thursday. Neighbors at Abdul-Rasheed's apartment complex in suburban Columbus said they saw a man outside his apartment two nights ago screaming and pounding on the door. The man fit Abdul-Rasheed's description, but they couldn't say if it was him. 'He was just screaming, ''Why? Why?''' Tim Butts, whose apartment is across the parking lot, said Thursday. Butts, a technology manager in the Columbus area, said at first he thought the man was joking around. 'It went on and on for about 10 minutes,' Butts said. 'He was just outside the apartment there, banging on the door a couple times, then starts screaming, looking everywhere with his hands in the air.'",

        "document": "By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 20:43 EST, 5 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 6 January 2014 . A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer . A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer. The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer out of more than 180 countries, research has found. Experts said that poor physical fitness is increasing women’s risk of developing the three forms of the disease, all of which are linked to a lack of exercise. ‘These figures reflect the sedentary lifestyles of many people in Western countries, with lots of us spending too much time sitting around and not incorporating physical activity into our daily routine,’ said Dr Rachel Thompson of the World Cancer Research Fund. Britain had 133 cases of bowel, breast and womb cancer per 100,000 people, the statistics showed. Barbados had the most out of the nations studied, while the Bahamas had the ninth highest rate. But Dr Thompson said data collection from these two countries was less reliable than in Western Europe and the US, and the numbers affected were far smaller. In effect, this means that the UK has the eighth highest rate, topped only by Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Iceland, Luxembourg and the US. Britain fared worst when it came to breast cancer. For this form of the disease alone, it had the seventh highest rate out of the countries studied, the International Agency for Research on Cancer statistics showed. Scientists estimate that about 12 per cent of bowel and breast cancer cases could be prevented if people were more physically active. For womb cancer, the figure is at least 10 per cent. Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, such as gardening. This is thought to help by allowing people to stay slimmer, which cuts the amount of cancer-promoting hormones produced by body fat. The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer out of more than 180 countries, research has found . However, just 36 per cent of women meet the moderate exercise target. Dr Thompson added: ‘It is a major concern that women in the UK are placed so highly in the world for cancers that are partially preventable through people being more physically active. ‘Regular activity can help strengthen the immune system, keep hormone levels healthy and the digestive system in good shape, all of which help reduce our chances of developing cancer.’ Last year, US researchers  found women who walk for an hour a day can cut their risk of breast cancer in later life. Those who took part in vigorous activity received almost double the protection. A spokesman for Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘We’ve known for some time that being active can reduce a woman’s risk of breast cancer.‘We advise that 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day, or 3.5 hours a week, can reduce breast cancer risk by at least 20 per cent. ‘Any activity that raises your pulse reduces your risk – so regular brisk walks are an easy and free way to get active.’",

        "document": "An internet 'troll' who sent a threatening email to a Conservative MP was banned today from contacting a host of celebrities - including Lord Sugar. Frank Zimmerman avoided jail by a whisker when a district judge suspended a 26-week prison sentence for two years after he sent an offensive email to Corby MP Louise Mensch. The bearded 60-year-old, who was taken to court by police today after being arrested for failing to attend his sentencing last week, was given the suspended sentence, ordered to pay costs and made subject of a restraining order. Agoraphobic Frank Zimmerman was today spared jail as he was sentenced for 'trolling' Louise Mensch . The order - until further notice - bans the agoraphobic from contacting a string of well-known people. The list includes Mrs Mensch, her businessman husband Peter, and Mrs Mensch's ex-husband, property developer Anthony LoCicero. Lord Sugar, the Amstrad businessman and star of hit TV Show The Apprentice, was named on the restraining order, as was Terence Blacker, a columnist with the Independent newspaper and Zimmerman's former neighbour in London. Also listed was General Sir Mike Jackson - once head of the British Army - and David Petraeus, former US Army commander in Iraq and Afghanistan and now director of the CIA. Tory MP Louise Mensch tweeted to her followers: 'Had some morons threaten my children by email. To those who sent it; get stuffed losers' A previous hearing heard how Zimmerman had last year targeted the outspoken Mrs Mensch, telling her to stop using the social networking site Twitter or face the consequences. The white-haired defendant, who lives in a run down house in Gloucester, told Mrs Mensch she faced a 'Sophie's Choice' - a reference to a novel in which heroine Sophie has to choose between the life of her son or daughter at a Nazi concentration camp. The email, which was dated August 22, 2011, said: 'Subject: You have been HACKED :D . 'Louise Mensch, nee Bagshawe, the slut of Twitter. 'We are Anonymous and we don't like rude c**** like you and your nouveau riche husband Peter Mensch. You have been hacked! 'We are inside your computer and all your phones, everywhere ... and inside your homes. 'So get off Twitter. 'We see you are still on Twitter. We have sent a camera crew to photograph you and your kids and will post it all over the net, including Twitter. C***face. 'You now have a Sophie's Choice. Which kid is to go? One will, count on it c***. 'Have a nice day . 'From all of us at MIT 617-253-1000.' The Northamptonshire MP, 40, who has a Twitter following of 50,000, immediately called in the police and arranged security for her family. Unbowed, she went on to tweet to followers: 'Had some morons threaten my children by email. To those who sent it; get stuffed losers.' But in her victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Mensch revealed the fear that the email had caused her. 'I was terrified on behalf of my children. I was in New York with my husband recovering from an operation and my children were with their father and to receive a threat like this made me very upset,' she said. 'I was 3,000 miles away from my children and I was worried for their safety and the safety of my ex-husband. I felt powerless to do anything.' 'He made reference to the contents of the email and that one of my children would die and it made me believe he was responsible,' she said. The offensive email was later traced to the IP address of Zimmerman's home computer. He was charged with an offence of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message or matter. The case against Zimmerman, from Barnwood, Gloucester, had been proven in his absence after he failed to attend court - blaming his agoraphobia and depression. He was supposed to have been sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court last week but failed to attend. Police arrested him this morning for breach of bail, an offence he admitted once he was brought to court. Some of the horrific emails sent to Louise Mensch by Frank Zimmerman . Zimmerman, who is extremely well spoken, wore a dark blue coat and glasses for today's short hearing. The last time he had faced District Judge Martin Brown he had appeared via video link from a side room but today he was in the dock of court room one surrounded by two guards, having been brought up in handcuffs from the cells. Zimmerman does not accept his guilt and blamed hackers for sending the email from his IP address. At a previous hearing he said he had received correspondence from broadband supplier Virgin Media stating his computer had been hacked but has, so far, failed to produce the letter to the court. Zimmerman has been told not to contact Ms Mensch and other high-profile people as part of his sentence . Kirsty Gordon-Cleaver, defending, said her client was maintaining his innocence. 'Mr Zimmerman wants the court to know that he is considering an appeal,' she said. 'He never will contact the people on the restraining order and it does not cause him any problems. He does, however, uphold his innocence in respect of this.' Passing sentence, the district judge told Zimmerman that he had committed a very serious crime. 'I have heard about the allegations and in my view they went beyond mere mischief,' he said. 'These were ugly, unpleasant and serious remarks to the complainant by email. Quite understandably they caused her great concern. 'They cross the custody threshold because of the seriousness. 'Because of your age and because of your conditions and I accept that you have certain problems, although I do not accept they are as severe as you make out, I am prepared to suspend the sentence.' As part of the suspended sentence, Zimmerman is banned from contacting Mrs Mensch. On hearing that, the defendant replied: 'There are no problems with that happening. You have my word.' The district judge continued: 'If you do, you will be in breach of that suspended sentence and you will give the court no alternative but to implement it. 'If you commit any further offences, that will also trigger the activation of that suspended sentence.' District Judge Brown told Zimmerman that if he breached the restraining order, he could be jailed for up to five years. The defendant was also given a four-week sentence for the bail offence, which runs concurrently to the 26-week sentence, and ordered to pay £300 prosecution costs. The district judge said he had decided against banning Zimmerman from using a computer. 'It had been my intention to prohibit him from using a computer and I accept the human rights angle and I accept the problems of policing that,' he said. Louise Mensch made her followers aware of what was happening when Zimmerman started sending the vile messages . Mrs Mensch took to Twitter to praise the police and the House of Commons authorities.'Now finally free to talk about this,' she wrote. 'I want to thank Det Sgt Iggy Azad & all at House of Commons & Northants Police. 'Other women besides myself were targeted by this man; and police forces (not knowing who was behind threats) were forced to devote resources. 'Sentence seems proportionate and just. I hope it will deter others from this kind of abuse and bullying.' Before Zimmerman was released, he asked the judge: 'May I ask how I am able to get home? I have no money.' The judge said he did not have any duty to get him home and added: 'You have had plenty of time to organise your finances.' As he left the dock, Zimmerman said: 'I thank you for your time.' Previously, Zimmerman told the court that he does not have enough money to even eat. 'I have no means of getting home,' he said. 'I am not physically capable of walking and I have no money. I have no money. I simply cannot afford to eat. 'I still have a vestige of pride. I do not have enough money to eat continually for four weeks every month, so every month I don't eat for seven days. 'It is 11 days since I had anything to eat. 'There is no way that I can afford a taxi to Cheltenham and back.'",

        "document": "By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 05:31 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 6 June 2013 . It brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘heavy police presence’. This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle . to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on . the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London . Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some . officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of . shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in . organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on . Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark  Cavendish at the Help . the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police . Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but . comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for . purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes . officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month . ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could . face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards . set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail . regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style . assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male . officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese . and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review . some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot . complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment . should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just . because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very . fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1.    Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.    A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull).   You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine. PRE Scale – As you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20. Number 6 being very, very light and 20 being exhausting. Aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15, which should feel like a HARD run. If you feel you have exceeded number 15, then slow down as you could be running too fast.",

Department spokeswoman Lara Jones says the officer was among about 30 officers assigned to provide traffic control and security for the annual Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City. She says the department does not tolerate bias and bigotry, and it does not allow personal beliefs to enter into whether an officer will accept an assignment. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A police officer was put on leave for refusing to work Salt Lake City's gay pride parade (pictured) on Sunday . Executive director of the Utah Pride Center Stephen Ha is pleased that the Salt Lake City police department is taking a stance against bigotry . She declined comment on the officer's reason for refusing the assignment. 'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,'Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.' The officer, whose name wasn't released, is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation. 'Officers are routinely assigned posts,'Jones said. 'To have an officer object for, perhaps anything other than fitness for duty, physical fitness etc.,  would be problematic to a smooth-functioning police department.' Lara Jones, a spokesperson for the Salt Lake City police department said that police must put their personal beliefs aside for the good of the community . Utah Pride Center officials say they're pleased with the department's stance and think officers should undergo sensitivity training before joining the force. 'Clearly the officer’s act was more than just smelling of bigotry, but I think the act was bigotry, choosing to not do a duty that is sworn by police officers to do,' said the executive director of the Utah Pride Center Steven Ha. Jones told reporters that bigotry is not allowed in the department and even though the unidentified officer is on paid leave he may lose his job. 'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,' Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.' Police Chief Chris Burbank is supportive of the gay community and has even ridden in the pride parade. 'The vast majority of officers understand: When they put their badge on . and come to work, they leave their personal beliefs at home, and we . provide service to the community,' said Lara Jones.

        "document": "By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A 12-year-old girl who underwent life-saving gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs following brain tumor surgery has returned to school 50lbs lighter. Alexis Shapiro, who now enjoys activities including swimming again, told NBC News that she feels 'reborn' and grinned for pictures ahead of her first day back in a classroom in almost two years. But while she has shed 50lbs and reversed her diabetes, there are still struggles; she has a hormone condition that must be treated by a drug injection minutes after symptoms appear to avoid a coma. The pre-teen, from Cibolo, Texas was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and surgery to remove the mass disturbed her metabolism and left her body unable to regulate energy or appetite. Back to school: Alexis Shapiro, 12, smiles ahead of her first day of sixth grade on Monday. It comes five months after she underwent gastric surgery to curb her weight gain following a rare brain tumor . Still smiling: When asked how her first day back to schoolwent, Alexis gave a thumbs up and a thumbs down to show that it was fine, her Facebook page explained - but she was still smiling . Alexis, previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight, gained 151lbs in the space of two years thanks to hypothalamic obesity. She developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems. Her parents Jenny and Ian, learned that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery, so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover medical costs. Alexis went under the knife on March 21. Due to complications, what should have been a gastric bypass had to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery at the last minute. The sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size. According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise. If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs. Before surgery: She put on more than 150lbs following surgery for the brain tumor. Her parents, Jenny and Ian, turned to the internet when their insurance refused to cover the gastric surgery for Alexis . Fighter: She is pictured ahead of the surgery in March. Since getting the gastric sleeve, she has lost 50 lbs . All smiles: Alexis is pictured before she was diagnosed with the life-changing rare brain tumor . But three months after the surgery, her mother revealed Alexis' type 2 diabetes was 'pretty much gone'. At 203lbs, Alexis was also suffering form an enlarged liver, but now the large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level. On Monday, when she returned to class, a school nurse stood by with a walkie-talkie and her emergency medicine in case her hormone condition sparked an 'adrenal crisis', NBC reported. The adrenal insufficiency is a side effect of the brain tumor and she also takes oral drugs to manage it. But when a crisis is on its way, she starts to get a headache, vomits and has low blood sugar. If symptoms were to show, she would need a dose of Solu-Cortef within 30 minutes. If she does not get it, her organs will begin shutting down, her mother said. Back in charge: Alexis is now swimming and playing like she did before and her mother says she has more confidence. She is pictured right in a swimsuit - which had been one of the little girl's aims . Jenny Shapiro said her daughter's return to school was both exciting and nerve-racking. 'It's... a huge step in the right direction, but it's just so hard to let go,' her mother Jenny told NBC. 'I'm her security blanket. I've always been with her so I've learned her symptoms.' But shesaid that not only is Alexis more physically capable, she is also returning to her happy, confident self. She recalled a recent conversation that 'melted my heart'. Her daughter told her: 'You know what? I used to see this fat little, chubby girl (in the reflection). I looked in the mirror and I saw somebody pretty. I like that girl.'",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Wanted: Patient person. Physically fit, with basic knowledge of biology. Able to take pictures. Job: Find Bigfoot. Scientists in China's Hubei Province have announced they are looking for additional members for its special team tasked with tracking down the creature. The Hubei Wild Man Research Association (HWMRA) is recruiting researchers internationally to join the group's search in the Shennongjia forest region, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Luo Baosheng, vice president of the HWMRA, told Xinhua that the organization is comprised of more than 100 scientists and explorers who have been chasing the ape-like animal for years. The last time a organized search took place was in the early 1980s, Xinhua reported Saturday. \"Most importantly, we want the team members to be devoted, as there will be a lot of hard work in the process,\" Luo told Xinhua. Team members are also expected to be in good physical health and preferably 25 to 40 years of age, he added. The search for the phantom, known as the \"Yeren\" or \"Wild Man\" in China, will cost at least $1.5 million U.S. dollars, according to Wang Shancai, a member of the the group and an archaeologist with the Hubei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology. The group is seeking funding from various companies and institutions, Wang said. Chinese researchers have been searching since the 1970s. There have been more than 400 reported sightings of the half-man, half-ape in the Shennongjia area. In the past, explorers have found inconclusive evidence that researchers claimed to be proof of Bigfoot's existence, including hair, footprints, excrement and a sleeping nest, Xinhua reported. Witnesses say the creature walks upright like a human but is much taller, and is covered in hair head-to-toe. The search for Yeti is not restricted to China. People in the United States have been looking for years. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) claims it's the oldest and largest organization with the goal of finding Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch. The organization relies heavily on eyewitness reports from residents. According to BFRO's website, the animal began to be referred to as Bigfoot by journalists in the 1950s after a spat of sightings reported in northern California.",

        "document": "By . Associated Press . Michael Phelps is coming out of retirement, the first step toward possibly swimming at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The 22-time Olympic medalist will compete for the first time since the 2012 London Games at a meet in Mesa, Arizona on April 24-26. Bob Bowman, the swimmer's longtime coach, told The Associated Press on Monday that Phelps is entered in three events â€” the 50- and 100-meter freestyles and the 100 butterfly. Making waves: Michael Phelps is due to compete in his first race since the 2012 London Olympic games . 'I think he's just going to test the waters a little bit and see how it goes,' Bowman said by phone from Baltimore. 'I wouldn't say it's a full-fledged comeback.' Phelps returned to training last fall and re-entered the U.S. drug-testing program. He has completed his six-month waiting period by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to be eligible for competition. Bowman said Phelps is 'pretty far' from being back in top form. He's been training Monday through Friday with Bowman's team at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. 'He's gotten back into good shape since September,' the coach said. 'He can give a good effort and certainly not be embarrassed. He's in enough shape to swim competitively.' Besides Phelps, USA Swimming said Olympians Ryan Lochte and Katie Ledecky are among those expected to swim in the Arena Grand Prix at Skyline Aquatic Center. Back on the fly: Phelps, seen here at the London Games, is signed up to compete in three shorter races at a Mesa, Arizona meet later this month including the 100m butterfly . Phelps turns 29 in June and is the winningest and most decorated athlete in Olympic history. He captured 18 gold medals and 22 medals overall at the last three Summer Games. He broke Mark Spitz's record for a single Olympics by winning eight gold medals at Beijing in 2008. Phelps had vowed that he wouldn't swim into his 30s. His camp is being low key about the comeback. 'I think he's just really enjoying it,' Bowman said. 'He enjoys the training and being physically fit. He just kind of wants to see where he's at. It's more really for fun. It's been nice for me to see him swim just for the joy of it really.' In Mesa, Phelps will swim 100 free and 100 fly preliminaries on the first day. Then, if he qualifies, he'll decide which race to swim for the evening finals, Bowman said. He'll swim the 50 free on the second day and might swim the 50 fly 'just for fun,' the coach added. Timing: Former teammate Ryan Lochte (seen competing against one another in 2012) will also be getting back in the pool at the Mesa meet, suggesting that they are both ramping up to compete in 2016 . Phelps will stick to the shorter races and some relays rather than the grueling individual medleys he swam during the height of his career. 'He's really doing this because he wants to â€” there's no outside pressure at all,' Bowman said. Phelps has already entered the remaining Grand Prix meets in Charlotte, North Carolina in May and Santa Clara, California in June, although Bowman said no decision has been made on whether he will compete. Depending on his early results, Phelps could compete in the U.S. National Championships in August in Irvine, California where teams will be selected for the 2015 world championships. 'I wouldn't say it's 100 percent on the radar,' Bowman said. 'After Mesa, we're going to sit down and talk about it.'",

And Good Samaritan laws have been fiercely challenged in courts across the country, leaving the average person unclear about just how protected they may be. \"In America where there's a lawyer behind every defibrillator, there's worry that some people have 'Am I going to get sued?'\" said Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University. Last week, shortly after Bayless' death, the family said they were satisfied with the care she received, according to KGET. \"I never said I was fine with that,\" daughter Pamela Bayless told CNN Monday before hanging up the phone. \"That was completely taken out of context, and I have no further comment.\" From a \"medical ethics point of view, I think if you call 911, and 911 says, 'start CPR,' you have to do it,\" Caplan said. \"You are under an obligation to do it. You've started that process and you must follow through. \"The policy on paper may make sense,\" he said, \"but policy be damned when someone's life is at stake.\" The 911 call . When Bayless collapsed in a dining room last Tuesday morning, someone at Glenwood Gardens called 911, and Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher Tracey Halvorson answered. A Glenwood Gardens employee gave the phone to a nurse who identified herself as Colleen. During the call, Halvorson tried to reason with Colleen to start CPR, and when she said her boss won't allow that, the dispatcher asked her to hand the phone to someone nearby, or anyone the nurse could flag down who was not beholden to the facility's policy. \"I understand if your boss is telling you you can't do it,\" the dispatcher said. \"But ... as a human being ... you know ... is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die?\" \"Not at this time,\" Colleen answered. In the last three minutes of the call, Halvorson said, \"OK. I don't understand why you're not willing to help this patient.\" Colleen: \"I am but, I'm just saying that ...\" Dispatcher: \"OK, I'll walk you through it all. We, EMS take the liability for this, Colleen. I'm happy to help you. This is EMS protocol.\" Colleen is then heard asking someone nearby to call a supervisor. \"Can you get (unintelligible) ... right away,\" Colleen said. \"I don't know where he is. But she's yelling at me and saying we have to have one of our other residents perform CPR. I'm feeling stressed and I'm not going to do that, make that call.\" The nurse asked the dispatcher when the fire department would arrive. \"They're coming as quick ... they've been on the way all this time. But we can't wait. This lady is going to die,\" the dispatcher answers. Colleen replies, \"Yeah.\" Glenwood Gardens' corporate owner is Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., based in Tennessee. CNN asked spokesman Matt Fontana why a nurse would be involved if the facility's policy prohibits staffers from performing medical care. \"(Colleen) was hired to be the Resident Services Director and that is the capacity in which she was serving,\" Fontana explained in an e-mail. \"Glenwood Gardens is an independent living facility which, by law, is not licensed to provide medical care to any of its residents,\" Fontana told CNN. \"We are conducting an internal review to determine all of the facts about what occurred while waiting for the paramedics, who arrived moments later,\" he wrote. \"We have communicated our deepest sympathies and condolences to this resident's family on the passing of their loved one.\" Late Tuesday night, Brookdale released a statement that said it was conducting a company-wide review of its policies. \"This incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical care for our residents,\" the statement said. 'Ethical north star' \"How could someone who is trained as a medical professional have their views so inverted by a corporate policy?\" said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the division of medical ethics at Weill Cornell Medical College. \"If this had happened on a city street in Manhattan, one would be governed by common morality.\" The nurse at Glenwood is \"confused about where their ethical north star is,\" he said. Fins and other experts pointed to Good Samaritan laws that seek to protect well-intentioned helpers who try to save someone in danger. But there have been challenges to California's Good Samaritan law. In 2009, the state Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a woman who tried to pull a motorist from a wrecked car. The woman was accused of yanking the motorist like a \"rag doll\" and worsening the motorist's injuries. The court found that the woman was not covered under the state's Good Samaritan law, which had been in place since 1980. The law provides that \"no person who in good faith, and not for compensation, renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission.\" And according to Caplan, Vermont's Good Samaritan law fines a person $100 if it's clear that they could have stepped in to perform CPR but refused. The Bakersfield Police Department told CNN that they're investigating what happened at Glenwood Gardens. Dr. Graham Nichol, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said he was shocked by what happened there. CPR doubles survival odds, he said. \"If liability was a concern,\" Nichol said. \"I would suspect there is a greater liability if someone dies.\" CNN's Paul Vercammen, Miguel Marquez and Lindsey Knight contributed to this report.",

        "document": "By . Damien Gayle . A television programme is out to test whether innocent people can be brainwashed in becoming unwitting assassins as in the plot of political thriller The Manchurian Candidate. In the 1959 novel, a man is brainwashed into becoming an unwitting sleeper assassin as part of a Communist conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government. The novel and its film adaptations have intrigued many, and related conspiracy theories have long-held that the U.S. government and others have tried to develop techniques to control the minds of individuals. Programmed to kill: Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey in a scene from the 1962 cinema adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, in which a man is brainwashed into becoming an assassin as part of a communist plot . In one famous case, the assassin who killed presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy, Christian Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan, later claimed he was hypnotised into carrying out the killing. Likewise, Patty Hearst, the newspaper heiress kidnapped by the left-wing revolutionary group the Symbionese Liberation Army, claim the gang brainwashed her into taking part in a bank robbery. There have been government-sponsored studies into the possibility of mind control. Between the Fifties and Seventies, the CIA conducted controversial experiments to develop behavioural engineering that many believed aimed at brainwashing subjects. MKUltra was the code name for a covert CIA human research program run by the CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence. The program began in the early Fifties and continued at least through the late Sixties, using mainly U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MKUltra involved the use of many methodologies to manipulate individual mental states and alter brain function, including the surreptitious administration of drugs and other chemicals, sensory deprivation, isolation, and verbal and sexual abuse. It was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. However, investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKULTRA files destroyed in 1973. The Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order. In recent times most information regarding MKULTRA has been officially declassified. It was first made available through a FOIA request in 1977 that uncovered a cache of some 20,000 documents relating to project MKULTRA and led to Senate hearings. In July of 2001 some surviving information regarding MKUltra was officially declassified. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that Richard Helms, director of the CIA, ordered many files related to the programme - known as MKUltra - destroyed in 1973, years before any investigation into it began. It was nevertheless found that the remit of the project was to develop mind-controlling drugs and techniques, with the CIA especially interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders. Now a Discovery Channel documentary aims to see if it is indeed possible to persuade unwitting, law-abiding subjects to become cold-blooded killers who will shoot someone to order, Today's Clicker blog reports. Experimental psychopathologist Cynthia Meyerburg, who oversaw the study, says in a trailer for the documentary: 'Science has only begun to understand how the brain works, and one of the things we don't yet understand is whether it's possible to control someone else's mind.' The programme will show work with a group of test subjects who gave their consent to take part in a hypnosis study for television. They were not told that the ultimate objective of the study, as described in its trailer, is 'to take a mentally healthy, law-abiding individual and program them to shoot and kill a complete stranger'. Not all experts are agreed on whether the goal is possible to achieve. Oxford University neuroscientist Matt Stokes, who also contributes to the film, said: 'What we're trying to do here is strip away someone's sense of free will and see if they can carry out extreme acts. 'Can it be done? Well, I'm not so sure that it can.' Curiosity: Brainwashed will be broadcast on Sunday night at 9pm on the Discovery Channel.

        "document": "(CNN) -- This time of year, I am disturbed at the number of curveballs we see being thrown during the Little League World Series. I coached youth baseball for eight years, each spring and fall. Three years ago, I wrote that Little League Baseball should ban the use of the curveball by its young pitchers. The evidence seemed clear -- and sports injury doctors seemed to all agree -- that pitchers who were 13 and younger were not physically capable of handling the torque and strain on the elbow when throwing a curveball. The ulnar collateral ligaments connecting the lower and upper part of an arm simply couldn't survive the strain, they said. Now, there is evidence the curveball may not be entirely to blame. But there is still debate over whether it should be allowed at such a young age. Little League and others did separate studies -- and got somewhat similar results showing that injuries can result not just from throwing curveballs, but from kids throwing too much, with too little rest between pitching appearances. Little League instituted strict pitch-count and innings-pitched rules five years ago. But those rules don't apply to non-Little League-sanctioned games. \"The difference now is, kids are playing on a number of travel and showcase teams outside Little League, and they have no such rules,\" says Lance Auken, vice president of communications for Little League Baseball. \"Travel ball has no rules on pitch count or number of innings pitched. So you now have kids throwing 300 to 400 pitches over a four-day period,\" he says. Doctor: 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave' Little League Baseball commissioned its study with USA Baseball and the University of North Carolina. More than 1,300 pitchers of all ages were examined. For the Little League age group, 409 pitchers were analyzed, looking for which factors influenced injury risk. \"What was causing arm problems was not the curve ball, but the overuse of the arm. It found no evidence to say breaking pitches caused no more injuries than any others,\" says Auken. Meanwhile, a group of doctors including Dr. James Andrews, the country's leading doctor in sports arm surgeries, conducted their own study. Andrews specializes in \"Tommy John\" surgery, which reconstructs the ulnar collateral ligament and is named after a former Major League pitcher. Andrews and his team at the American Sports Medicine Institute did their study in a laboratory, not on a field. And they found throwing a curveball enacts no more force on the arm than a fastball. But, they say, throwing curveballs early can lead you down a dangerous path later in a baseball career. \"Dr. Andrews still insists, 'Don't throw curveballs until you can shave,\" Lanier Johnson, Executive Director of ASMI told CNN. And, he acknowledges, \"That was a controlled lab setting. The field of play during a game isn't like that.\" \"We've tracked Little League games right through the Little League World Series, and as the competition grows, the kids throw curveballs up to 70% of the time,\" Glenn Fleisig, ASMI's director of research and co-author of the Andrews study, told ESPN The Magazine. \"It's good that Little Leagues have enacted rules on pitch counts, but for say, a kid in the Dominican (Republic), if you see an unusually developed curveball at an early age, who knows the mileage on that arm?\" Johnson says, \"The kid who throws all those curve balls in the Little League World Series is a hero. But does he ever get a change to earn a college scholarship or sign a major league contract? Do you want to take a chance on your son or daughter to get a college scholarship? Do you want to be a hero at 13 or 14 but never much else after that?\" Surgery on the rise for young players? Even though Little League has instituted new pitch count rules, ASMI says Andrews has performed about seven times the number of arm operations on young pitchers that he did 15 years ago. So why not err on the side of caution and take Andrews' advice? \"(Andrews) himself will say that is an opinion of his, and is not based on any empirical data,\" Auken says. \"There wasn't any evidence in this study. It's a fine distinction between the two.\" \"Little League has always been the leader in sports safety. We make changes in our sport based on data, not on feelings. We act out of scientific evidence,\" he says. However, Andrews' office does agree that kids who pitched while fatigued are 36 times more likely to have serious arm problems. Some 2.6 million kids play Little League baseball all over the world. Parents often are sizing up the competition for their 10- to 13-year-olds for future high school teams and college scholarships, and believe their kids should play as much as possible to improve their chances. Little League officials admit too much baseball is not healthy. \"Kids play year-round now,\" Auken says. \"Kids shouldn't be playing year-round in anything. If a parent is making a 10-year-old do that ... it will make them hate the game by the time they are 16 or 17 years old.\" Andrews' group isn't alone on its curveball stance. Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of the Division of Sports Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston, told the Boston Globe in April that he still believes the curveball is best not thrown until a pitcher is at least 14. He also said kids shouldn't attempt to throw a slider, a pitch that puts even more stress on the elbow, until 16. Don Friend, an Atlanta-based pitching instructor and former scout for the Atlanta Braves and the Boston Red Sox, gave my son the same guidance in years of lessons. My son went on to pitch for NCAA Division III Piedmont College. Dr. Timothy Kremchek, an Ohio orthopedic surgeon who is the Cincinnati Reds' physician, told the New York Times this spring he performs 150 elbow ligament reconstructions a year. \"Seventy percent of those surgeries are pitchers who haven't hit college yet,\" Kremchek said. \"I ask each one the same question: When did you start throwing curveballs? And they say: 'I was 10. I was 11.' Sometimes, it's 9.\" Five years ago, I attended a coaches' clinic at Georgia Tech that included the coaches and trainers of Georgia Tech and the Atlanta Braves. At the time, Georgia Tech had a team that counted and documented every pitch of the televised Little League World Series. Team members noted an increase in the use of the curveball every season. Andrews appeared in a video message, and all at the clinic agreed no one under 14 should be throwing the curveball. If you are watching the Little League World Series as a baseball purist, that sweeping hook of the curve can be a thing of beauty. But take a good look at the kids throwing them now. Chances are, you may not see them throw it or any other pitches without major surgery needed before they reach high school. So I will ask Little League again: Why not ban the curveball?",

        "document": "(CNN) -- It's been called the fourth \"R\" of education: reading, writing, arithmetic and now, aerobics. But the gym class of generation Wii isn't the same one you probably remember from school. \"You hear sometimes the old stories ... where you roll the ball out and students just played the game,\" says Hanna Vaandering, president of the Oregon Education Association. \"That's not what physical education is about today.\" As they struggle to keep kids active in the midst of an obesity epidemic, PE teachers are using technology and the latest fitness trends to inspire even the most nonathletic children to develop a lifelong love for exercise. \"If you don't have health, what do you have?\" Vaandering asks. \"You've got to make sure (students) understand how to take care of their body.\" Fighting an epidemic . Stop me if you've heard these statistics before: Approximately 17% of Americans age 2 to 19 years old are obese. Though recent studies have shown signs of progress, an estimated one out of every eight preschoolers in the United States is still obese, according to the CDC. And only 25% of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 met the national fitness recommendation of 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily in 2012. PE teachers have struggled to fight the effects of childhood obesity in class, says Vaandering; many children's motor skills are not where they should be and cardiovascular endurance is a big problem. And frankly, in general, \"kids are lazier,\" says Rich Muller, a PE teacher at Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, New Jersey. \"They don't want to work. They don't want to do anything.\" Not just flag football anymore . In his 28 years as an educator, Muller has seen a significant shift in the kinds of activities taught in gym classes. Just a decade ago, he says, the focus was 95% on team sports. Now teachers are incorporating golf, rock climbing, bowling and even ping-pong into their curriculum. \"I'm trying to find that environment where they can find that one lifelong activity,\" says Matthew Pomeroy, a PE teacher at Merton Intermediate School in Merton, Wisconsin. \"All those different things that kids can kind of be engaged in and enjoy.\" Is yoga too religious for schools? While kids in Pomeroy's district tend to be more active than the average American middle schooler, he sees another troubling trend: students who are spending 10 to 12 months of the year playing only one sport. While that's great for physical fitness, he says, orthopedic surgeons are seeing an increase in children's sports injuries related to such repetitive motions. Both Muller and Pomeroy offer students at their respective schools a choice every day: They can play volleyball or do yoga; they can practice archery or work out in the weight room. Zumba. CrossFit. Geocaching. Tabata. Spinning. All these and more are offered to encourage students to move. \"The participation level has skyrocketed because they have more options,\" Muller says. \"It's fun. We have hardly any complaints like we used to.\" Technology . If there's one thing Pomeroy is pumped about, it's using technology in his class. The self-proclaimed Twitter fanatic has reached out to PE teachers all over the world to bring new ideas to his students. Pomeroy's class uses iPads to analyze their archery or free throw techniques. With an app called Coach's Eye, they record videos of their shot, then play it back while discussing their form. Pomeroy has also split his class into groups to create their very own workout videos -- recording these at home is easier for some students than performing live in front of their peers, he says. Many schools provide pedometers and heart rate monitors for students, Vaandering says. When she taught elementary PE, she encouraged her students to increase the number of steps they took during every class. \"You'd see their little feet moving while we're giving instructions because they want to get more steps,\" she says with a laugh. Pomeroy has taken technology even further, using it to connect his students with others across the globe. In one instance he teamed up with a PE teacher in the United Kingdom to pull off an international dance team competition via Skype. Another time, his students gave jump rope lessons to their peers abroad. \"Sometimes for phys ed, you just need to get out of the gym,\" Pomeroy says. Stress . Perhaps one of the biggest differences Vaandering sees in students today is high levels of stress. An overemphasis on standardized tests and budget cuts has removed important stress outlets such as art class and PE in some schools, she says. A few districts in Oregon have even cut recess for elementary school. \"That's so not in line with brain research and what science tells us about a child's learning (process),\" Vaandering says. \"In reality there needs to be a balance and a respect for the whole child.\" Why kids need recess . Some schools are getting the message that stress reduction is an important part of a child's overall well-being. They're incorporating yoga and meditation, Muller says, while educating the mind, body and spirit. In health class at Dwight-Englewood, students are offered the opportunity to use apps like Calm.com, which provides a soothing screen and sounds in timed blocks to calm the mind. \"It's amazing how much better you feel after two minutes,\" Muller says. What you can do . Parents play a big role in their children's success at school, Vaandering says, whether it's in math class or gym class. \"It really is important to do family activities,\" she says. \"Enjoying each other's company, going hiking, playing pickleball on the weekend.\" Pomeroy agrees. \"You can make such a great connection with your kids through physical activity.\" What does your family do to stay fit?

        "document": "(CNN) -- Yes, safaris are great and the beaches are diverse and dramatic. But an Africa getaway doesn't just have to be about 4X4 game drives or lazy strolls on cotton-soft sands by crystal blue waters. If you're looking to soak up the continent's breathtaking scenery, and have an eye for adventure, then there's only one place to be: at the top. From the snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, through the forest-clothed slopes of Mount Kenya, to the Alpine meadows of the High Atlas Mountains, Africa's magnificent rooftops offer glorious views and a wide range of trekking experiences that appeal to all kinds of climbers, from hardcore mountaineers to weekend warriors and families. \"It's the terrain and the ability to combine a wildlife experience with the climb,\" says Sunit Sanghrajka, president of U.S.-based travel group Alluring Africa, explaining what draws outsiders to the continent's mountainous areas. \"Also, Africa being kind of distant and lesser known, there is an allure to it,\" he adds. Sanghrajka says the continent's growing political and economic stability, coupled with improvements in communications and airlift, have all helped attract more and more tourists in recent years. \"The overall interest in Africa has grown exponentially, especially from the U.S. market,\" he says. Here, Inside Africa picks seven of the best treks and hikes from across the continent. Kilimanjaro . Make it to the summit of Tanzania's 5,895-meter Kilimanjaro, and you'll be standing at Africa's highest point. The majestic mountain is Africa's most-visited trekking destination, attracting tens of thousands of tourists and adventurers every year. \"You don't have to be a technical climber to climb Mount Kilimanjaro; you just need to be pretty physically fit,\" explains Sanghrajka. \"We've had more people requesting Kilimanjaro in the last three or four years because it's something they feel is attainable -- it can be combined with a family vacation and that's why I think it's so popular.\" There are six routes to choose from, each with varying degrees of difficulty, scenery and success. No special equipment is required. On the way to the \"Roof of Africa,\" you will travel through five different climactic zones, reaching arctic cold temperatures around the glaciers that cap Kibo, Kilimanjaro's summit. You'd better hurry, though, as climate change experts say that the ice and snow in the mountain's upper slopes are melting and could disappear within decades. Watch this: Climbing Kilimanjaro . Atlas Mountains . The High Atlas is an impressive mountainous range in central Morocco that hosts North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal, at 4,165 meters. There's a variety of routes to follow during your ascent but inexperienced climbers should note that the trek through the mountain's challenging terrains is quite demanding. Passing though the rugged landscape you'll get the chance to explore spectacular gorges and rolling valleys as well as encounter the local Berber people who've inhabited these tough terrains for centuries. The best time to climb the High Atlas is during the summer months. Mount Kenya . A long-extinct volcano, Mount Kenya is Africa's second-highest peak, at 5,199 meters. Lying just south of the equator, the mountain's glacial valleys, successive vegetation zones and diverse wildlife will guarantee you spectacular scenery and a fantastic trekking experience. The ascent, however, to the mountain's steep ice-capped peaks is quite challenging. \"Mount Kenya is the most technical, probably, in that East African area,\" says Sanghrajka. At the mountain's crest, temperatures rarely rise above freezing point. There are several routes on the way to the mountain's summit, the majority of which take between three and seven days to complete. Mount Meru . Mount Meru may forever be destined to exist in the shadow of its imposing neighbor, Kilimanjaro, but Tanzania's second-highest mountain (4,565 meters) has its own devotees. \"It's lesser known, but Mount Meru is for the true enthusiast who wants to experience what very few people actually do,\" says Sanghrajka. A beautiful volcanic cinder cone, Mount Meru will treat you to stunning views and diverse wildlife. Its slopes are coated with dense rainforest up to about 2,900 meters, which then give way to rocky areas. Mount Meru is often used by mountaineers for acclimatization before trekking Kilimanjaro, or by those wanting a trek with the local Massai.

With its stupendous rock-hewn churches and medieval castles, northern Ethiopia's rich cultural heritage has long attracted tourists from around the world. But visitors to the area are also increasingly being drawn to the spectacular Simien Mountains, a natural marvel where several jagged peaks of solidified lava are separated by deep valleys to form an overwhelming landscape. The mountains are also home to some of the world's rarest animals, including the walia ibex, which is not found anywhere else in the world. Since 1978, the region's national park has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The highest point is Ras Dejen, at 4,533 meters. Read this: Rock churches 'built by angels' Mount Elgon . Mount Elgon is a magnificent extinct volcano dominating the skyline along the Uganda-Kenya border. Its enormous crater is surrounded by several jagged peaks, including Wagagai, which is the highest point at 4,321 meters. Here you can explore ancient caves and zip past spectacular cliffs, over which Mount Elgon's streams cascade as dramatic waterfalls. Elgon's slopes are covered in ancient dense forests and bamboo belts which then give way to a spectacular moon-like moorland zone blanketed by tree heaths, massive groundsels and lobelias. There are several routes to the mountain's peaks, and the full trekking circuit takes up to five days. A descent into the vast caldera, at 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, is also a must. The Drakensberg . The Drakensberg is a vast mountainous range in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, rising to 3,475 meters and stretching for some 1,125 kilometers. The giant mountains are ideal for both casual day hikes through indigenous forests and more serious expeditions along tough terrains and rocky terraces. They also host several game reserves and parks, attracting thousands of tourists every year. \"A lot of people like to go and hike there because it's absolutely stunning,\" says Sanghrajka. \"The scenery is fantastic.\"",

But with the addition of flatscreen TVs, en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning, these shipping containers are now being billed as a solution to London’s housing crisis. The containers come from China and are transformed into studio apartments in Britain which can be stacked on top of each other - and are available to rent for only £75 a week. The scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the Forest Young Man's Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites in Waltham Forest, north-east London. Scroll down for video . From the outside: The YMCA have unveiled a revolutionary housing scheme at their branch at Waltham Forest in north-east London using converted shipping containers to house young people on low incomes . Comfortable: Former YMCA resident Louise Stephenson watches TV in one of the homes in north-east London . Solution: It is hoped these shipping containers from China - which are transformed into studios in Britain and can be stacked on top of each other - could help solve London's housing crisis . The 'mYPads' - which cost £20,000 each - are designed to allow young people to have their own rental accommodation but at a price that allows them to save up for a deposit. It is thought each of the homes could save taxpayers £25,000 each year by taking people off housing and other related benefits. Louise Stephenson, 30, is a former Forest YMCA resident who hopes to be one of the first people to take advantage of the scheme once the sites are completed. The receptionist said: ‘The idea of being able to get your own place for £75 per week and not have to be living with a shared bathroom in London is just unheard of.

Washing up: Louise Stephenson, 30, is a former Forest YMCA resident who hopes to be one of the first people to take advantage of the scheme once the sites are completed . ‘It is so difficult for people on low . income wages to pay their rent and travel costs and still have money to . live on and that is very demoralising and a lot of people are left . feeling like “why do I bother?\" 'The idea of being able to get your own place for £75 per week and not have to be living with a shared bathroom in London is just unheard of' Louise Stephenson, 30, who is hoping to live in a mYPad . ‘It will be quite a story to tell friends that you “live in a shipping container” but the units really are going to be great as they have air conditioning systems that will allow them to stay cool in the summer and warm in the cold winter months.’ A Forest YMCA spokesman said: ‘We developed mYPads as a direct response to the mounting financial issues faced by our vulnerable young residents when they try to make the transition from supported housing to independent living. ‘Young people who gain full time employment, and are no longer in receipt of benefits, are often unable to afford the costs of renting a property privately in East London and the associated costs of securing a home.

How they once appeared: A cargo ship packed with containers at Harwich port in Essex (file picture) ‘mYPads offer an affordable solution to this problem, and they enable our residents to save for a deposit and the other financial requirements of living independently.’ This is not the first time that shipping containers have been adapted into homes. MailOnline reported last November how a housing trust in Brighton wanted to use 36 adapted containers as a stop-gap for people without a permanent home. The containers were transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboarded walls. The structures were designed for a social housing project in Amsterdam in 2010, but the scheme was abandoned after funding issues. High property prices, steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside town have contributed to high levels of homelessness.

Forest YMCA chief executive Timothy Pain said: ‘We’ve been overwhelmed by the support the mYPad project has received since its inception. ‘Equally, we’ve encountered so many obstacles and objections, but all of our hard work and persistence has paid off. ‘This isn’t just great news for us at Forest YMCA, but for the sector as a whole, as the mYPad project will now have its opportunity to prove itself as a credible solution to the affordable housing crisis that is affecting so many young people.' Last month it was claimed by the body which represents London's councils that more than 800,000 new homes must be built in the capital by 2021 to keep up with housing demand.",

        "document": "She parachuted behind Nazi lines and risked her life gathering vital information on enemy positions ahead of the D-Day landings. British spy Phyllis Latour Doyle, then 23, toured occupied Normandy by bicycle disguised as a 14-year-old French girl selling soap to German soldiers. But hidden on pieces of silk among the brave young woman’s knitting were the secret codes used by the slightly-built agent – codename Paulette – to send back her messages to Allied Command. For decades after the war Mrs Doyle, known as Pippa, kept her extraordinary past hidden too, only telling her children 15 years ago. Scroll down for video . French Ambassador to New Zealand Laurent Contini speaks to Phyllis (Pippa) Doyle before presenting her with France's highest honour award in Auckland on Tuesday . Mrs Doyle, 93, spied on German troops and risked her life to send 135 coded messages back to Britain during World War Two . But yesterday the modest heroine, now 93 and living in a rest home in New Zealand, made a rare foray into the spotlight of public acclaim as she was presented in Auckland with the Legion of Honour, France’s highest award for bravery. With a Parachute Regiment wings badge and honours including the MBE she was awarded after the war and France’s Croix de Guerre pinned to her cardigan, Mrs Doyle received the award from the French ambassador to New Zealand, Laurent Contini. ‘Pippa stands out as a formidable example for younger and older generations alike,’ he said. As part of its commemorations of the 70th anniversary of D-Day, France is recognising military veterans and civilians who fought in the Second World War. 'At the age of 21, she decided to join the resistance movement in a foreign country, held dangerous positions and undertook perilous missions to prepare the grounds for the allied troops to march on,' Mr Contini said . Mr Contini said that when mother-of-four Mrs Doyle, who moved to Auckland in the 1970s, was told of her award she was ‘surprised that we have found her and said ‘‘but what did I do to merit that?’’’. What she did began when she joined the RAF to train as a flight mechanic in 1941 and the secret services spotted her potential. With an English mother and a French father, a doctor, she was fluent in French and was whisked away to be trained as one of the few women agents working for the Special Operations Executive. Reluctant: Mrs Doyle said that she spent years hiding her wartime actions and only told her children about her vital role in the liberation 15 years ago. They encouraged her to request her medals, pictured above . Spy: While living in France in 1944, Mrs Doyle was known by the codename Paulette . ‘I did it for revenge,’ she told New Zealand’s Army News magazine in 2009, explaining that she joined SOE because her godmother’s father was shot by the Germans and her godmother committed suicide after being imprisoned by them. As well as extensive physical fitness training, Mrs Doyle told in the rare interview how one of their instructors was ‘a cat burglar who had been taken out of prison to train us’. She said: ‘We learned how to get in a high window and down drainpipes, how to climb over roofs without being caught.’ She first deployed in Aquitaine in Vichy France from 1942, then dropped into the Calvados area of Normandy on May 1, 1944, sleeping rough in forests or staying with Allied sympathisers. In total, she transmitted 135 secret messages to Britain via radio sets after linking up with the French Resistance. If she encountered the enemy she would ‘talk so much about anything and everything trying to be ‘‘helpful’’, and they’d get sick of me’. Mrs Doyle also told Army News how she once sent a message requesting a German listening post be taken out by bombers, but a German woman and two children died. ‘I heard I was responsible for their deaths. It was a horrible feeling,’ she said. ‘I can imagine the bomber pilots patting each other on the back and offering congratulations after a strike. But they never saw the carnage that was left. I always saw it, and I don’t think I will ever forget it.’ After the war Mrs Doyle, who was born in South Africa, married an Australian engineer and lived for spells in Fiji and Australia before settling in New Zealand. Yesterday Mr Contini said Mrs Doyle ‘held dangerous positions and undertook perilous missions to prepare the grounds for the Allied troops to march on’ and told of his ‘deep admiration for her bravery and her unshakeable commitment to ending the war’.

        "document": "By . Bianca London . Spend hours in the gym carving out abs good enough to grate cheese on but nowhere to show them off? Well maybe your body ifs good enough to be on the books of a new model agency called Ripped. As the name suggests, it's looking for well honed men and women who have an athletic body they want to showcase. How do you get noticed? Founder  James said it goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure to be apart of the agency . The agency describes itself as an 'elite group of the UK’s fittest male and female fitness models and bodybuilders who either work in the fitness industry, are passionate about sports, are competitive bodybuilders or simply live for their next workout.' Ripped claims it's at the very cutting edge of fitness and specialise in fitness, underwear, sports, physique and fashion modelling. A lot of the 60 models on its books, who range from a 16-year-old to a 38-year-old, also go on to do swimwear, sportswear, protein bars and vitamin range campaigns. Most of the talent work as bodybuilders, circus performers, boxers, martial artists, fire-breathers and fire fighters and model in their free time. Peak physical condition: Ripped claims it's at the very cutting edge of fitness. One of their models, Adam, 26, is an example of this . Range of talent: A lot of the 60 models on its books go on to do swimwear, sportswear, protein bars and vitamins and supplement range campaigns . In shape: Speaking about the agency, the founder described fitness modelling as an 'art-form' The agency don't charge the models to be listed on its website and claim to only take a small commission when one of their models gets signed for a job. Speaking about setting up the agency, founder James Bishop said: 'I have always believed in physical fitness as a way of de-stressing and as a way of getting some good, quality time to yourself. 'I also enjoy seeing the results it brings. So, I decided to open the agency and it has gone from strength to strength in the short time it has been open.' 'Fitness modelling is an art-form,' he added. 'Just as an artist will put all his efforts into the final product, so do our guys and girls. They spend hours in the gym most days to reach perfection - and this is what our clients want. 'There are huge numbers of underwear brands, fitness equipment manufacturers and fashion labels who want models who are at the peak of their physical fitness. 'They want guys with abs of steel, powerful pecs and muscles on top of their muscles and ripped or defined girls who are the picture of health and fitness. 'Our models are dedicated to their training. Most of them work out in the gym as the basics, most supplement this with running, team sports and swimming. Some of our guys and girls are professional athletes and of course, some have full-time jobs. We have a firefighter, a serving soldier and, of course, we have lots of personal trainers on our books. They work out! Most of the models at Ripped work out in the gym as the basics and most supplement this with running, team sports and swimming or body building like Richard, pictured . 'There has been lots of media attention in recent years about the negative effect of using size-zero models, and there will always be a stereotype that models exist on one lettuce leaf a day. 'Our guys and girls are the opposite. They can eat up to 6,000 calories of nutritional - this is the keyword - food a day, but of course they burn it off through their exercise and training, leaving an amazing body which can potentially earn them thousands.' Speaking about the agency and getting noticed, James said: 'It goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure. With guys, you can be a huge man-mountain of muscle like a really huge bodybuilder, or you can be slim and defined. Here come the girls: For girls to get noticed, James said you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders adding that 'as long as you look amazing, you will be fine' 'What you must have are impressive abs though, this is the true mark of a fitness model. 'For girls, you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders. As long as you look amazing, you will be fine. 'What sets us apart though is that we insist you are fun to work with, and are down to earth. We don't put up with divas and neither do we think much to dull personalities. 'If you look good, know how to stay calm and happy, love showing off your body then please get in touch.' For more information, visit rippedmodels.co.uk .",

        "document": "By . Sadie Whitelocks . PUBLISHED: . 08:54 EST, 12 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 13 December 2013 . She might have earned the title 'Fit Mom' with her impeccably toned body post three children. But Maria Kang, 32, from Sacramento, California, finds keeping in shape a constant struggle because she's not genetically predisposed to looking 'like a model' or 'Barbie doll.' In her twenties she suffered from bulimia, which saw her weight fluctuate dramatically. At her heaviest, her 5ft 4in frame tipped the scales at 152lbs - putting her in the overweight category. Scroll down for video . Fit mom: Maria Kang, 32, from Los Angeles, California, (pictured in 2007) says keeping in shape is something she has to work hard at because she's not genetically predisposed to 'look like a model' In an interview with MailOnline, she reveals how she started feeling self-conscious about her body from a young age. Often she would compare herself to her taller, leaner sisters or supermodels in magazines. 'I was always heavier . . . I was chunky. ' she said. Her mother also battled weight problems and was put on a special diet in a bid to cure diabetes and high blood pressure. Becoming aware of the connection between food intake and weight, Ms Kang says, was a trigger for her eventual disordered eating. Lots of hard work: The petite brunette was overweight and suffered from bulimia before getting in shape - she said the real turning point was meeting her husband and falling pregnant with her first child . Feeling 'lost' in her early twenties, the self-described 'pear-shape' brunette would binge and purge on sweet foods two to three times almost every day of the week. 'I used disordered eating to fill an empty void. It was worse when I was feeling anxious. People often call bulimia the \"good girl drug\" because we don’t do drugs or drink alcohol we just abuse food.' 'I had to let go of being perfect, When I became pregnant with my first child I was like \"Wow this is what my body is really made for\"' As is often the case with bulimia, Ms Kang saw her weight yo-yo and her metabolism 'shut down'. Although friends and family were aware of what was happening, they didn't know how to help. In the end it was Ms Kang who made the conscious decision to start 'loving' herself. Determined to get physically fit and healthy, she started practicing mindful eating. However, the real turning point came . when she met her husband, David Casler, in 2007 and fell pregnant with . her first son two years later. 'I . had to let go of being perfect,' she said. 'When I became pregnant with . my first child I was like \"Wow this is what my body is really made . for.\"' Bouncing back: This photograph shows Ms Kang one week after giving birth with her first child . Made for motherhood: Ms Kang said she got healthier with each pregnancy through diet and exercise - here she is pictured carrying her first child in 2009 (left) and her third son in 2011 (right) Looking back on her days as a bulimic, on her blog she writes: 'It was a horrible habit. 'I felt like I had no control over my  mind and I had such self-defeating thoughts. I felt a variety of emotions, sadness, guilt, emptiness.' After giving birth she started treating herself 'kindly' and eating right. Because she was in a regular pattern the pounds slipped away and she managed to slim down to 125lbs. 'I think fitness always makes me . happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your . life' Ms Kang fell pregnant with another boy a year later in 2010 and again in 2011. Each time, she said she was able to bounce back because the foundations of a 'toned figure' were already in place. Offering a tip to other women she said: 'Be fit before you get pregnant.' Now her favorite parts of her 125lb, . size 2 body include her arms and 'toned abs' but she is less . enthusiastic about her 'short', 'muscular' legs. 'I don’t have long legs. I never wear skinny jeans.' Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted a photograph of her toned post-baby body to Facebook, captioned 'What's your excuse?' Stirring trouble: Ms Kang came to the public's attention last month when she posted this photo of her toned post-baby body to Facebook . The photo, which Ms Kang has since used as her profile picture, shows her knelt alongside her three young sons, dressed in a workout bra and matching micro shorts. While many of her 256,000 followers cited her as an 'inspiration' some also accused her of being 'insulting', 'obnoxious' and a 'fat shaming bully'. Indeed, one woman wrote: 'You are . . . hurtful to women and think way too much of yourself. Disgusting is what you are!' 'If I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!' And a mother-of-two named Sarah added on Ms Kang's website, mariakang.com: 'I have two kids and both have caused my skin to stretch soo bad my stomach, from my rib cage straight down the the middle of my vaginal area, look like the U.S. road atlas. 'People like you who post pictures like this make people like me cry because I know that without surgery to lose the extra skin I will never look like you.' But Ms Kang told MailOnline that she was merely being 'playful' and saying if 'if I can make health a priority as a working mom of three kids who has struggled with bulimia and weight issues, then you can too!’ To maintain her figure she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of 'intense' strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week. Keeping fit and healthy: Ms Kang said that she didn't intend to upset people and she hoped the photo would inspire others to feel better about themselves . Breaking a sweat: The pretty brunette says that she likes to do 30 to 60 minutes of strength training and cardio every morning, five to six days a week .

It’s the ability to be set a goal, take action, remain consistent and create a result. that process takes a lot of discipline.' she said. When it comes to food she likes to eat protein and carbohydrates at each meal. Describing her daily diet she said: 'I have eggs and oatmeal or eggs and fruit for breakfast. 'On the go I like to eat nuts – mainly almonds. Lunch I usually have what we had for dinner the night before. Today it will be turkey meatballs and sweet potato fries. I love salads too.' But it's not all clean eating and, as a busy mother-of-three running on a budget, Ms Kang has admitted to eating fast food, especially when it’s convenient with her kids in tow. 'I think fitness always makes me happier it makes you feel like you can control so many things in your life' Starting from a young age: She says her sons know how to do sit-ups because they watch her workout . ‘There are healthier fast food options that are affordable. for example, I like the $1.50 grilled chicken wraps from Taco bell.' Two of her other biggest temptations - bar pre-made chicken wraps - are dark chocolate and red wine. Concluding on the topic of fitness and health she said: 'I think that we’re obviously struggling as a nation with our weight and it’s a sensitive issue. 'My issue is that people are often push body image before health. Right now, I’m talking about health.’ 'I work to be a role model.

        "document": "Imagine: you are sitting with friends, one day in the distant future, in a space-age house, while robot servants cook dinner, fold laundry and mow the lawn. Inevitably the question arises: \"What was your first robot?\" For many -- 10 million, in fact -- the answer will be Roomba. The mini vacuum cleaning robot, launched in 2002, has become an everyday fixture in homes across the world -- earning pet-names from affectionate owners and a unique place among the internet's viral cat videos. Colin Angle, who co-founded manufacturers iRobot in 1990 with fellow MIT alums Rodney Brooks and Helen Greiner, hails Roomba as \"the world's first practical home robot.\" The company is now hoping to infiltrate the boardroom with its wandering \"AVA\" telepresence robot, and the battlefield with its line of defense machines. Angle sat down with CNN's Nick Glass to talk about making the sci-fi world of robots a reality. CNN: What got you into robotics? Angle: I had grown up with Hollywood concepts of robots, and the labs that Dr Brooks and I worked in were focused on trying to make it real. In fact, our first business model was to send a robot to the moon and sell the movie rights. We actually got quite far. It didn't ultimately succeed but it did get us going, and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers were impacted by the work we'd done. It was very cool but not a great business. How did you go against the movies' concepts of robots? Hollywood likes to imagine robots as mechanical copies of ourselves -- which is a terrible idea. What did everyone think robot vacuuming was going to be? Well, they think Rosie the Robot from \"The Jetsons,\" a human robot that pushed a vacuum. That was never going to happen. We know that robot vacuuming was top-of-mind in how robots were going to help our lives. Our challenge was that we knew how to make the intelligence inexpensive -- but we didn't know how to vacuum. How did you learn to make Roomba? We entered the toy industry: we partnered with Hasbro building robot baby dolls and robot dinosaurs. They taught us how to manufacture very complicated electric mechanical things at a low price. We partnered with Johnson Wax, the guys that make the industrial cleaning machines, and we built giant robot cleaning machines. We were also building robots for the Pentagon to clear minefields. Using that intelligence technology actually gave us the algorithms which Roomba uses to make sure [your home] is thoroughly vacuumed. How did you name your machine? Naming is something not necessarily best left to an engineering organization. We had a contest inside iRobot to figure out what we should name the robot and the best we brilliant engineers could come up with was the \"Cyber Suck.\" What's the future? If you think about what robots are supposed to do in our future, we're just about half of the way there. They can vacuum, they can scrub your floors -- but what about my laundry? What about all these other things that robots are supposed to do? What's the next big need? Well, I think it has to do with extending independent living: allowing our ageing demographic to live independently in their homes for longer. What will the robot home of the future look like? You may have a menagerie of robots that move around and do things: you may want a robot to bring you a beverage. You're not going to talk to your vacuum cleaning robot: in fact you may never see your vacuum cleaning robot because ideally you come home every day and your floors are freshly vacuumed. You may have this robot whose mission in life is to interact with you: it can be a security guard, it can be a robot that a doctor could beam-in and control... [to] see your daughter who has scraped her knee. There's this human interface robot which ultimately will be at the epicenter of this robot enabled home.

        "document": "London (CNN) -- A British spy found dead at his home in 2010 -- his naked body padlocked inside a large red carrying bag stowed in the bathtub -- was either suffocated or poisoned, but it is unlikely his death will ever be satisfactorily explained, coroner Fiona Wilcox said Wednesday. Gareth Williams' death was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated,\" she ruled. He probably entered the bag alive, Wilcox said, reading her ruling to a court around the corner from the home of the world's most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. But she was sure an unknown person put the bag containing his body into the bath and probably locked it, she said. The case has gripped the British public for more than a year and a half, since Williams, an MI6 agent known for his mathematical genius and codebreaking talent, was found dead at age 31 in August 2010. But after a weeklong inquest at which evidence from hundreds of expert witnesses, security camera images and police interviews was presented, the \"most fundamental questions as to how Gareth died remain unanswered,\" Wilcox said Wednesday. There was \"endless speculation but little real evidence,\" she said. And in unusual criticism of the Secret Intelligence Service, as MI6 is formally known, she said a delay in reporting his death and in providing relevant evidence added to the uncertainties about the case. Some of that evidence came to her only in the last 48 hours of the inquiry, Wilcox said. The coroner appeared briefly overcome with emotion as she came to the end of reading her ruling, her voice faltering as she announced her findings. The cause of death remains unknown, but experts agreed it was either from suffocation or poisoning, she said. \"I am therefore satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully,\" she concluded. Among the theories aired by UK media were that Williams might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong, neither of which was supported by the evidence, the coroner said. She also cast doubt on suggestions that he was into bondage or transvestism, fueled by the discovery of women's clothes, wigs and cosmetics in his apartment, saying she thought Williams bought them out of an interest in fashion, rather than any sexual motivation. Expressing her sympathies to his family, Wilcox said the inquest could not bring him back, but she hoped it had at least allowed them to see the evidence out in the open. A lawyer for Williams' family said that losing a much-loved son and brother would have been a tragedy in any circumstances but that the nature of Williams' death had made it all the worse. \"Our grief is exacerbated by the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even the most basic inquiries as to his whereabouts and welfare, which any reasonable employer would have taken,\" he said. \"We are also extremely disappointed at the reluctance and failure of MI6 to make available relevant information.\" The family has called for the Metropolitan Police to review the role of the intelligence services in the investigation. MI6 head John Sawers apologized \"unreservedly\" to Williams' family for the service's failure to act more swiftly and said measures have been put in place to make sure it doesn't happen again. The detective leading the police investigation, Jackie Sebire, said new lines of inquiry had resulted from the inquest and would now be \"actively pursued.\" \"His naked body was found in the most suspicious of circumstances,\" Sebire said. \"It is highly likely that a third party was involved in Gareth's death, and I urge anyone who knew Gareth or who had contact with him to search their conscience and come forward with any information about what happened that night.\" Inside the court, a picture emerged of a man who had few friends but was very close to his family, highly intelligent and physically fit thanks to his love of cycling. A math prodigy who had completed his mathematics degree and master's by the age of 21, he was someone who relished a challenge and had received an award for his \"world-class\" work for the intelligence services. Summing up the evidence, Wilcox said it was \"extremely unlikely,\" but not impossible, that Williams had worked out a technique to get into the bag -- measuring just 32 inches by 19 inches (81 by 48 centimeters) -- and lock it from the inside. But, she said, there was no evidence of footprints or handprints on the walls of the bathroom or the bath itself, as might have been expected if he had done that. He was not a risk taker, she said, and that made it unlikely in her view that he would have put himself into the bag even as a personal challenge without making sure he could get out. Of the four keys belonging to the padlock that secured the bag in which Williams was found, one pair was found inside it with him. A second pair was found on a key ring in his apartment, Wilcox said. There was no sign that evidence had been tampered with, such as traces of bleach. There was also no sign of a break-in or robbery in his neat, tidy apartment, she said. She described his body as \"peaceful\" and said there was no indication of a struggle. Wilcox also said there were no indications that Williams was feeling suicidal. However, tests that might have revealed unusual or volatile poisons were ruled out by the decomposition of the body. Traces of alcohol and a chemical matching the party drug GHB were found, but both can occur naturally as part of the decomposition process, she said. British media have reported that Williams' Internet history showed an interest in sex games and bondage, but Wilcox said the codebreaker had made only a handful of visits to bondage sites. The coroner said there was no evidence of interest in claustrophilia, a fetish for enclosure in very confined spaces. His apartment contained 20,000 pounds ($32,000) worth of high-fashion women's clothing, unworn and packed as purchased, Wilcox said, but she said she found no connection between his death and his interest in fashion and women's shoes and clothing. There also was no indication that his death was connected to his work, she said. He had not taken on any high-risk operations, and he worked only in the UK. There was no evidence of threats arising to him from his work, his employers testified. Wilcox was highly critical of Williams' line manager, who did not report that he was missing for about a week after he died August 16. She said the inability of the manager to recall certain key bits of evidence concerning the week of Williams' death \"is beginning to stretch the bounds of credibility.\" When questioned, the manager said he assumed Williams was absent for a legitimate reason that he had forgotten about, even though he missed several meetings. They worked on a small team of four people. The manager and other SIS employees testified from behind a screen and were identified only as SIS, plus a letter. Williams was finally reported missing by a co-worker August 23, more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work. \"I can only speculate as to what effect this had on this investigation,\" Wilcox said. The decomposition of Williams' body was hastened by the fact it was in a top floor apartment, where the temperature soared in the summer heat. The heating was mysteriously also turned on, despite it being a hot August, she said. Police did not secure the scene until eight or nine days after Williams died. Reports about the \"body-in-a-bag spy\" describe how two experts spent days trying to figure out whether Williams, who was athletic and of medium height, could have contorted himself in such as way as to lock himself into the North Face holdall bag, with a key to the padlock inside. Video provided to the court shows one of them, Peter Faulding, folding himself laboriously into an identical bag placed in a bathtub. Faulding, who specializes in rescuing people from confined spaces, told the inquest that he had tried to lock himself into the bag 300 times without success. A second expert witness, also of a size and build similar to Williams, tried 100 times to re-enact the feat without succeeding. Neither ruled out definitively the possibility that Williams could have somehow done it alone. But a small trace of someone else's DNA was found on the bag, helping spawn all kinds of theories about who else might have been there. Williams was recruited into the intelligence services straight from university, working with Government Communications Headquarters before MI6. The nature of his work and questions around why his spy agency bosses took so long to raise an alert about his absence have added to the intrigue surrounding his death. Concerns about national security have been a factor in the 20-month delay in holding Williams' inquest, and an agency more used to working in the shadows has had an uncomfortably bright light shone into its practices. A series of photographs provided by the Metropolitan Police show the tidy, impersonal interior of the spy's Pimlico home and the small white-tiled bathroom where his body was found. A bicycle parked in the hallway is a clue to Williams' passion for cycling. A glimpse through a bedroom door shows a bed half-made, clothes lying on it. But little else can be gleaned from the images. The Metropolitan Police says it is continuing its investigation, particularly in light of the coroner's findings and the concerns raised by his family. But for now, the identity of the unknown person who apparently put the bag holding Williams into the bath, exactly how he died and the reason why, remain as much a mystery as ever.

He mowed the grass and tended the estate for nearly 20 years. But all those lawnmowers, strimmers and chainsaws took their toll on Clifford Sayers, it was claimed yesterday. The 65-year-old gardener believes he was deafened by the din from the power tools. And now he is suing the 90-year-old baroness who employed him. Battle: Baroness Chelwood (left) is being sued by Clifford Sayers - the former gardener taken on by her late husband Tufton Beamish (right) In a £25,000 compensation battle, Mr Sayers is seeking damages for ‘noise induced deafness’ he says he suffered while looking after the East Sussex estate, home to Pia, Lady Chelwood, widow of Military Cross holder and former Tory MP Tufton Beamish. Yesterday a court heard that when he complained to her about the ringing in his ears ‘her response was that she would get similar symptoms when loading her husband’s guns’. The case of the gardener, the war hero and the baroness emerged at the Appeal Court in London as lawyers argued over whether Mr Sayers had been denied a full hearing of his claim, which the baroness is contesting. Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, widowed Lady Chelwood said she felt betrayed by her former gardener. She said: ‘I’m furious that he has repaid our generosity and kindness with this legal action.‘He came to us in 1981. He was a truck driver and answered my husband’s advertisement for a gardener in the local paper. ‘He knew nothing about gardening but my husband was very kind to him, helped him to learn and we gave him the lodge for him and his sick wife to live in. ‘We paid for all his utility bills, heating, expenses, and a good wage. We looked after him and his family. ‘But when my husband died in 1989 I expected him to look after me and he did nothing. He was terribly lazy and never did the work properly, or weeded my vegetable garden when it was too much for me.’ Lady Chelwood said that after Mr Sayers’ wife died she asked him to leave the lodge. She added: ‘He was totally physically fit, with no hearing problems, when he left here in 2000, and I gave him three months’ notice pay and a six thousand pounds redundancy. ‘I feel so betrayed. This case has been thrown out so many times now it’s ridiculous.’ Celebrated: War hero and MP Tufton Beamish (far left) pictured with friends at the 1968 House of Lords shooting match - he hired the gardener now suing his wife . Claim: Clifford Sayers, 65, wants damages for 'noise-induced deafness' from Baroness Chelwood, caused by cutting her lawn, the High Court heard . Lady Chelwood added that ear protectors, as well as protective clothing, boots and waterproofs were provided for Mr Sayers by her and her husband. Baron Chelwood, formerly Colonel Sir Tufton Victor Hamilton Beamish, took on Mr Sayers as a gardener and forester in 1981. The outspoken backbencher, wounded during glittering war service at Dunkirk and in Italy, stepped down as MP for Lewes and retired from politics in 1974, when he was made a life peer. Although he listed gardening among his hobbies, he needed someone to look after the grounds of his country home, set in the East Sussex countryside above the South Downs. Wedding day: Lady Chelwood married war hero and MP Tufton Beamish in 1975 . Lord Chelwood – long satirised by Private Eye as Sir Bufton-Tufton – was a staunch champion of the countryside and a keen ornithologist. The court heard Mr Sayers worked for him until his death in 1989, then for Austrian born Pia. He is understood to have lived in the lodge until he left in 2000. Duties also included tending pheasants and feeding the ponies. But it was using the mechanical tools, Mr Sayers alleges, that caused the ‘intrusive’ ringing in his ears. He claims he had a 45 per cent reduction in his overall hearing and suffered from what was described as ‘an irreparable industrial disease’. However, he was told in 2005 that his hearing loss could be age related. Three Appeal Court judges reserved their decision on Mr Sayers’ appeal until a later date. Last night he declined to comment on the case. Estate: the couple pictured at their East Sussex home .",

After failing to turn up at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court in Gloucestershire for sentencing this afternoon, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Wanted: Internet troll Frank Zimmerman was due to be sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court in Gloucestershire this afternoon but failed to turn up .

'Sophie's Choice' - a reference to a novel in which heroine Sophie has . to choose between the life of her son or daughter at a Nazi . concentration camp. Zimmerman was charged with an offence of sending by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene, menacing message or matter. At a hearing at Gloucester Magistrates' Court in April, he was found guilty in his absence, having failed to attend on that occasion, blaming his agoraphobia and depression. He attended court last month for sentencing but a district judge adjourned the case until today so that a pre-sentence report could be completed. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said of this . afternoon's scheduled hearing: 'Zimmerman did not appear, and a warrant . for failing to surrender to bail was issued by the court, for him to be . arrested and brought before the court at the earliest opportunity. Concerns: Following a threatening email from Zimmerman, 40-year-old MP Louise Mensch immediately called in the police and arranged security for her family . 'The court declined to pass sentence in his absence.' Zimmerman's email, dated August 22 last year, read: 'Subject: You have been HACKED :D. 'Louise Mensch, nee Bagshawe, the slut of Twitter.

The offensive email was later traced to the IP address of Zimmerman's home computer. Zimmerman denied sending it, saying his computer had been hacked.

Davina Wright, 45, has been breastfeeding her triplets - Willow, Connor and Summer - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable. Ms Wright, who lives in Hong Kong with her husband Jason, was doing 30-40 feeds a day when their two daughters and son were first born but has since scaled back to just morning and night. Scroll down for video . Davina Wright, 45, has been breastfeeding her triplets - Connor, Willow and Summer - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable . 'They each have their own room and I go in to each of them individually and it is a lovely bit of one-on-one time,' Ms Wright told Daily Mail Australia. 'At three years old they are basically just fed to sleep, not that they actually fall asleep, it's more like 'fed to calm/sleepy'. 'In reality it is only about 10-15 minutes of their day, their hectic, chaotic, loud, busy, competitive, triplet day, where they get to sit quietly by themselves with mummy.' Ms Wright also breastfeeds first thing in the morning and she says the three toddlers are highly competitive as they fuss over who has to wait to be nursed. 'My kids walk and talk and eat solid food and drink from a cup and are independent and have a full set of teeth... all the things that people point out as reasons for weaning, but in actuality a child can do all these things and still be breastfed,' she said. Ms Wright says her triplets eat solid food and have a full set of teeth but she still breastfeeds morning and night to spend one-on-one time with each of her children . The three toddlers can be highly competitive as they fuss over who waits to be nursed, according to Ms Wright . 'I think the weaning down of feeds during the day was partly because we got so busy… there was play and stimulation and they just asked for it less. 'I really only say no to them now... when we are out in public. I say that we will wait until we are home for that now, simply because I am aware of how many eyes are on us.' The Wrights, who lived in New Zealand when the triplets were born, tried several plans before finally working out how to breastfeed three hungry mouths and still manage to sleep. 'We finally settled on (Jason) sleeping in the nursery with the two girls and bottle feeding them my breast milk at night,' she said. 'I would sleep in our bedroom with the third one and breastfeed him. Then after every feed I would pump the breast milk, which became the next nights feeding for the girls. Davina and her husband Jason gave birth to triplets after two rounds of IVF when they lived in New Zealand . 'As they got older they got much quicker at feeding and instead of 30-40 minutes, they would be done in 15-20, and then as they got older it still only takes 10 minutes.' Ms Wright, who has two adult daughters from her first marriage, breastfed them until they self-weaned at 13 months. 'I set myself the goal of two years with the triplets, not fully sure that we would get that far, and definitely not thinking we would still be going at three years old,' she said. 'But they are still happy with it and I am still happy with it and it works for our family so we keep going. Ms Wright used to feed 30-40 times a day when the triplets were newborns. But she has since cut scaled back to just twice a day . Ms Wright says a breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues . 'It has been everything to their lives, it has slowly changed to being a very small part of their lives, and one day it will be a distant memory in their lives. 'A breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues. The beauty being that every mother gets to decide for herself.' 'I know that extended, or natural-term breastfeeding isn't for everyone, and that is okay. I would say to people if it's not for you then don't do it, simple as that.'",

Stepping onto the Martian surface unsuited would cause your lungs to explode. The lack of pressure would make the rest of your internal organs burst too, as your flesh is eaten away by temperatures of –55°C. While this is the grim scenario played out in science fiction films, scientists are just as worried about the psychological effects of life on the red planet. Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student and decided to sign up . To find out how humans would cope, a project organised by the Mars Society has attempted to recreate the daily routine of astronauts here on Earth. More specifically, four miles from Hanksville, Utah in a high-altitude desert described as the ‘most Mars-like place on the planet’. For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering around once every three days. For two weeks in January, a group of intrepid space enthusiasts donned space suits and lived in isolation, surviving on rations and showering once every three days . Researchers from the Mars Society live at a simulated Martian base, built with the help of space agency Nasa . The two-storey hut is situated 40 miles from Hanksville in Utah . Among them was Elizabeth Howell, a University of North Dakota student, who heard about volunteers for the project through a fellow student. Speaking to MailOnline, she describes the unusual experiment as enlightening and at times overwhelming. ‘When I was in a spacesuit I felt like I was in an outside world,’ said Ms Howell. ‘It makes you think and behave differently.’ In total, the crew was made up of seven members– two scientists, two engineers, a medical doctor, a journalist and a humanoid robot. During her two week stay, Ms Howell’s home was the Habitat Module, a two storey silo-shaped building with lab areas and living spaces, eight metres in diameter. ‘There wasn’t much personal space,’ she said. ‘There were a couple of disagreements. The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots . Boredom wasn't an issue. The crew were tasked with completing over 20 research projects over the two-week expedition, including mock medical procedures . British student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on Mars. Ryan MacDonald, 20, beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one-way mission. The contest was part of the 'Mars One' project to establish a self-sustaining colony. It would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space. Mr MacDonald is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on Mars - which is 57 million miles away from Earth. The Mars One project was founded by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders, and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025. An initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses. ‘Only little things, like noise in the kitchen when you have to work out what to do. We quickly found out that we need to talk about these things at the beginning.’ If an argument did occur, crew members couldn’t just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support a day in advance. Even then, they had to put on an unwieldy spacesuit. The suits worn by the scientists came with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots. Although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission, the suits, more than anything, made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet. ‘You’d be surprised,’ said Ms Howell. ‘I actually felt like I was on another world, like I had to rely on these people. ‘I felt separated from everything else – you had this feeling that you were zeroing in on a priority.' Contact with the outside world was strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day. The Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) is one of two habitats maintained by The Mars Society. Its goals are to serve as a Mars analog environment for field operations, science and research . If an argument did occur, crew members couldn't just step outside to cool off. Leaving the Habitat Module required a request to Mission Support . This image shows the food the team eat. The experiments are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a journey . Most communication was with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts. That included details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status. Boredom, however, wasn’t an issue. The crew were tasked with completing around a dozen research projects over the two-week expedition. ‘We spent our time setting up a new radio telescope, doing simulated ‘Marswalks’ in spacesuits, and testing out protocols for medical procedures,’ said Ms Howell. Most communication was with 'mission control', who asked the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts . While the technology to conduct these experiments on Mars is advancing, what scientists really wanted to find out was how human error factor into future designs. ‘Something I underestimated was the physical fitness needed,’ said Ms Howell. ‘We did really long walks in the desert and it does make you tired.’ ‘It teaches you a lot about resilience, because when you’re resources are limited it forces you to be more creative.’ Some scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet, and there are currently hopefuls to be on that flight. Ms Howell, however, is an exception. ‘I’d only go if it wasn’t a one-way trip,’ she said. ‘I’d miss my friends and family too much.’ Nasa estimates the cost of the initial Mars landing to be £3.67billion, and every subsequent manned mission £2.45billion. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on Mars . Any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half, waiting for Mars and Earth to align properly for the trip back. During this time, they will supply their own oxygen, power, food, and water. The experiments being conducted in Utah and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip. The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months. Ms Howell admits that living for two weeks on a desert where there is gravity can’t come close to recreating the environment. ‘But I learned a great deal,’ she said. ‘We need to take gradual steps before we’re ready for a mission to Mars, and this is just one of them.’ Although not quite like the ones that would be used on a space mission, the suits, more than anything, made crew members feel like they were on an alien planet .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- As the sun sets over Seattle, Phoenix Jones straps on his bodysuit and pulls a black and yellow mask over his face. He is getting ready to venture into the night, looking for anyone who may be breaking the law. The 25 year old is not a policeman with a quirky dress sense, but one of the most prominent members of the real-life-superhero community, a movement of people who wear costumes inspired by comic book characters, trying to prevent crimes in their area. Jones patrols Seattle's more troubled neighborhoods five nights a week with his group, the Rain City Superhero Movement. His wider network, The Alliance, has 34 members across the United States, London and Dubai. His decision to become a real-life caped crusader came after his car was broken into, and his young son was hurt by the shattered glass. He said: \"I decided to actively fight crime and threw myself completely into it. After my experience I just felt there was so much apathy around and wanted to do something to make my community safer.\" The masked adventurer has been voted Belltown Neighborhood Hero by Seattle Magazine readers' choice poll, and has been documented as stopping a car from being broken into with his group. An unorthodox superhero . Jones, whose day job is teaching autistic children life skills, says he didn't read many comic books when he was young, because he couldn't identify with the heroes. \"It never appealed to me,\" he said. \"For example Batman, he was this billionaire living in a mansion and I was just a broke kid.\" Then, at 14, he came across a little-known character called Nightwing who worked as a waiter during the day, and fought crime at night, and was hooked. \"I fell in love with this idea, that you don't need to have a lot of money to go out there and make a difference,\" he said.

He is a former mixed martial arts fighter, and wears a $10,000 bulletproof, Kevlar reinforced, fire-retardant jumpsuit, made with D3L smart fabric which hardens on impact. His superhero activities landed him in trouble in 2011, when he was arrested for pepper spraying people outside a bar in Seattle. Jones said he was trying to break up a fight, and he was later released without charge. Helping abuse victims . The so-called \"Guardian of Seattle\" is married to fellow superhero Purple Reign, who uses her hero persona to raise awareness of domestic violence. She said: \"I was in an abusive relationship, and a lot of people around me noticed but said nothing. Now I want to inspire others to be heroes and stop minding their own business when they see abuse, as well as speak up for victims who have not yet found their voice.\" In her purple superhero bodysuit and mask, she gives anti-bullying talks at women's shelters and schools, organizes city clean-ups, and runs a project against domestic violence. Her campaigning earned her the University of Washington Women of Courage honor last November. Purple Reign says her superhero name represents the transformation she underwent from a victim to survivor of domestic abuse. \"Purple is a color which is very often used in domestic abuse awareness campaigns, and reign comes from the fact that I now reign over my own life,\" she said. \"Wearing the suit has helped me feel more confident and in control, and move on from my past. I am not a victim any more, I feel powerful.\" She uses the skills developed in her day job as an accountant to bring a more organized approach to the Reign City Superhero Movement's crime fighting. She uses 911 call information released by the Seattle Police department to create crime maps which allow group to target troubled areas of the city. Watch: Where are the superheroines? Purple Reign also regularly patrols with the group, for which she maintains high levels of physical fitness, a condition her husband says is crucial for anyone who wants to be a real life superhero. Superhero requirements . In fact, Jones is adamant that only people of military, police or martial arts background should consider becoming superheroes because their training could help them deal with potentially dangerous situations. In order to be to admitted to The Alliance, the rules are even tougher -- potential heroes must have: a steady job, must not have committed any crimes of dishonesty, be able to run two miles in eight minutes and 30 seconds in full gear, and be able to train with Jones for three days a week during the trial period. Read more: The town where superman lives . For aspiring superheroes overseas, The Alliance fundraises over its Facebook page. Funds are used to help newcomers to travel to Seattle for a two-week intensive crash course in superhero crime fighting. In spite of being shot at and stabbed twice, Jones insists that Seattle heroes don't deliberately try to get involved in trouble. \"Ninety percent of what we do is watching,\" he said. \"If we see somewhere is being burgled, we will call the police and track the perpetrator. We don't intentionally go in to tackle someone, we are just regular people who want to help their community.\" When it comes to continuing to fight crime into his old age, Jones is pragmatic. \"I don't think I will be doing it forever,\" he said. \"When I hit 33 or 34 I will either have to stop, or have some amazing gadgetry.\" But he insists that it doesn't take a supersuit to be an involved citizen. \"What Purple Reign and I are trying to do is promote community activism. Anyone can campaign for a cause, with or without a superhero suit.\"",

Two British soldiers shot dead last week in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge attack by local police. Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Com-mando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident. But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces. Killed: Female medic Channing Day, 25, from Comber in County Down, Northern Ireland, has been shot dead while on patrol in in Afghanistan . Tragic: Miss Day (centre) smiling with friends in a photo posted on Facebook . Last night a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’. Military detectives are exploring whether the soldiers were killed after British troops shot dead an Afghan policeman. And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – . asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on . blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – . said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is . not clear at this stage.’ Corporal Channing Day (left), 25, and Corporal . David O'Connor (right), 27, are believed to have been shot dead by an . Afghan policeman . Sporty: Channing Day dreamed of joining the army since she was a schoolgirl . On Wednesday morning, Cpl Day and Cpl O’Connor were patrolling through the district of Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province. Military sources say that when the . patrol reached the village of Char Kutsa they saw an Afghan male . crouching on the bank of a stream. The man was shot dead and later . identified as a local police officer. An Army source said: ‘The man wasn’t wearing a uniform, so there was no way of knowing he was an off-duty policeman. ‘It now seems that he was washing, a . ritual before conducting daily prayers. If the soldiers saw him with a . weapon he might have been mistaken for Taliban. Misson: Investigators were today interviewing survivors of the firefight amid the conflicting claims about what happened . At work: Channing Day was killed alongside a Royal Marine in the attack . ‘The investigation is focusing on the reasons for the decision to open fire and what happened next. ‘Other Afghan police or villagers . reacted badly to this mistaken shooting, believing they were all under . attack. The situation was messy and confusing.’ The Ministry spokeswoman added: ‘Further investigation into the involvement or otherwise of the dead Afghan male is on-going. ‘Analysis of the events surrounding . this complex incident continues and is likely to take some time while . forensic and other tests are carried out.’ Tragic: The family of Channing Day, pictured with her mother Rosemary, have been informed of her death . Loss: British Soldier Channing Day (centre) who was killed in Afghanistanypctured with friends on her Facebook page . Channing Day harboured a schoolgirl dream of joining the Army, a teacher at her former school said. As a bubbly and sporty teenager in Northern Ireland she completed work experience with the forces in 2002 and worked well with everybody there, Strangford College acting principal Paul Maxwell added. She was always physically fit and achieved top grades in PE, excelling at gymnastics, trampolining and netball. Mr Maxwell said: 'She always said she wanted to join the Army, she was pretty much focused on wanting to join the Army.' He said her sporting prowess revealed her gritty determination to succeed. 'It was not just that she was good but that she always showed commitment, she stayed after school and did all the practice,' he added. Ms Day left school at 16 and Mr Maxwell said he believed she went straight into the Army. The acting principal added: 'Every pupil is dear to us and I can remember Channing as if it was yesterday, somebody we remember as being young, and still so young, is suddenly killed in such a tragic way.' Cpl Day, from County Down, Northern . Ireland, was the third female member of British Forces to be killed on . operations in Afghanistan. Colleagues considered her a rising star and . she was an outstanding sportswoman. She joined the Army in 2005 and . deployed to Helmand Province at the beginning of October. She had completed previous tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cpl O’Connor, from Havant, Hampshire, was on his third tour of Afghanistan having joined the Royal Marines in 2002. He had deployed to Helmand at the end of September. A total of 435 British military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since operations started in 2001. Yesterday Cpl Day’s sister, Lauren, said there were no words to describe the sadness felt by her family in Comber, County Down. She said: ‘We are an extremely close family and this has hit us all hard. ‘Channing loved the Army. If there . was one thing she knew growing up, it was that she wanted to be a . soldier – she would march around the living room and never missed . cadets. ‘Channing grew up into the bravest, beautiful, determined woman. ‘She has done more in her 25 years than most women her age and we are so very proud of everything she  has achieved.",

        "document": "He was simply \"The Man.\" Stanley Frank Musial made a name for himself as one of baseball's best hitters of all time on the field, as well as one of its greatest, most dignified ambassadors off it. And now \"Stan the Man\" is gone. Musial died at his Ladue, Missouri, home  surrounded by family, the Cardinals said in a statement. According to a post on his Twitter page, which is maintained by his grandson Brian Musial Schwarze, Musial died at 5:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m. ET) Saturday of natural causes. He was 92. \"We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family,\" said William DeWitt Jr., the club's chairman. \"Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball.\" The Pennsylvania-born Musial transitioned from a lackluster pitcher to a stellar slugging outfielder, according to his biography on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's website. The left-hander had a batting average above .300 17 times during his 22-year career -- all played with St. Louis -- and earned three National League Most Valuable Player awards as well as three World Series titles. The only blip came in 1945, in the thick of World War II, when he left baseball to join the U.S. Navy. After the 1963 season, Musial retired with a .331 career batting average and as the National League's career leader in RBI, games played, runs scored, hits and doubles. He has since been surpassed in some of those categories, but he still ranks fourth in baseball history in total hits, behind only Pete Rose, Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron. Hall of Fame manager Earl Weaver dead . He also stood out for his grace and sportsmanship -- having never been ejected once by an umpire. In his retirement ceremony, then-Major League Commissioner Ford Frick referred to Musial as \"baseball's perfect warrior, baseball's perfect knight.\" In 1969, Musial was elected on his first try into the Hall of Fame, calling it \"the greatest honor of the many that have been bestowed upon me.\" During and after his playing career, Musial developed a special relationship with the St. Louis fan base, who knew him simply as \"Stan the Man.\" A bronze statue of him stands outside Busch Stadium, which is located in Musial Plaza along Stan Musial Drive. He continued with the organization for more than 25 years after his playing days ended, serving as vice president and general manager. And Musial was active in the community, contributing to causes such as the USO, the Senior Olympics, the Boy Scouts and Covenant House. \"I have no hesitation to say that St. Louis is a great place in which to live and work,\" he said in his Hall of Fame induction speech. \"We love St. Louis.\" His fans returned the favor, revering him for his play as well as his character and commitment to the area. \"Cardinal Nation will never be the same. Rest in peace Stan 'The Man' Musial, the best Cardinal there ever was,\" wrote one woman, by the name of Elise, on Twitter. Musial also stood tall outside eastern Missouri. He served between 1964 and 1967 as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. In 2011, President Barack Obama bestowed upon him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. \"Stan matched his hustle with humility,\" Obama said then. \"Stan remains, to this day, an icon, untarnished; a beloved pillar of the community; a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate.\" Lillian, Musial's wife of 71 years, died last May -- a longlasting marriage that some people, online, called as admirable as anything that happened on the diamond. Stan Musial's passing spurred an outpouring of condolences and praise. Commissioner Bud Selig described him as \"a Hall of Famer in every sense\" and \"a true gentleman,\" former pitcher Curt Schilling called his life \"a clinic in respect, integrity and honor,\" and current Cardinal Matt Holliday said it was \"an honor to the same uniform.\" The messages from fans were no less heartfelt. Wrote Jason Lukehart, on Twitter: \"In a week that's shown the dangers deifying athletes, Stan Musial's death reminds me that once in a great while, there's a man worthy of it.\" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .",

        "document": "(CNN)  -- From personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family, the public's comments on same-sex couples having families was supportive and critical, calm and heated -- sometimes all in one conversation thread. In CNN's documentary \"Gary and Tony Have a Baby,\" Soledad O'Brien follows a gay couple in their struggle through the legal and personal obstacles to become parents. We asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families. \"Whether they are gay as a couple, or gay as a single parent -- as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference. Compared to the atrocious things that we read here on CNN about what parents do to their children, being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing,\" says one reader. \"I work in a medical clinic and believe me, the large number of gay people/couples that we see are a helluva lot more 'normal' (and pleasant) than the straight people/couples!\" Others said that while they were against same-sex marriage, they saw no reason for sexual orientation to prevent having children through adoption or other means. \"My morals and my religion agree that marriage is between a man and a woman,\" says one reader. \"[But] I don't mind gays adopting.\" Another said: \"Marriage is an institution created by God to join a man and a women. That being said, children do need someone to love and if that person is psychologically sound, physically fit and has the wherewithal to create a supportive and loving environment for the child, it would [be] hard for me to say no way.\" Some said having same-sex parents would harm the child. \"Children being raised by gay couples can easily be targeted by bullies,\" said one reader. \"These children will go through a great suffering because they will be confused as to why they don't [have] a daddy or a mommy. It's a shame that the children are being exposed to something that God is against.\" Another wrote: \"If there is a mother and father possibility, [a child] should always go in the favor of the normal mother and father situation. It is the responsibility of those in charge to give them the best chance to survive in a culture that is normally straight. I am not against gays, but I do think there is a reality that one gender of parents is not the norm.\" Other readers shared their stories of growing up with same-sex parents or being a gay parent themselves. \"As a gay single man, it has been my honor to adopt four wonderful children,\" one reader wrote. \"Over the years we have encountered the typical family pressures as everyone else. Our only outward difference is that I am Caucasian and my children are African-American. Two of my four boys are now 18 and 19. Both are headed to college. My younger two are 15 and 16 now. Both successful high school students, happy and well adjusted (well as adjusted as a teenager can be!). ... My kids know about my life and were told when they were young. I have kept no secrets. ... Parenting means being there for your child. It mean participating in their lives. Loving them. Listening to their goals, biting your tongue when necessary and losing your mind when needed.\" Another said, \"My parents love me, that's all that matters. What makes you a better parent then mine? Because you're a Christian? Because you are straight? They love me and that's all that matters. They push me to succeed, and make me the best person I can be. Isn't that what being a parent is, loving you for who you are?\"",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post, but they still train like athletes. When you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse. The riders, as well as their runners, follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well-balanced and healthy body. \"Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking,\" flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. \"Now we're at the peak of our fitness. It's definitely not just sitting on a horse!\" In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. Any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the British Horseracing Authority now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by Perham. Getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world's speediest steeds to the finish. The legs, lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training. Upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse. \"If you looked at a jockey without clothes on, there aren't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin,\" Perham told CNN. \"It's literally muscle and bone. Jockeys are incredibly well-toned athletes in the same way that Olympic champions Jessica Ennis or Mo Farah are.\" Racing fit . Jockey training is not for the faint of heart, or those who like a lie-in. Lane trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on Sunday mornings. \"I'm up around half past five or six most mornings,\" the 27-year-old explained. \"I'd then spend two and a half hours riding out. \"Then I'll have a cycle -- I ride 150 miles each week. The aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season. \"Before the season starts, I'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well. \"In the afternoons I go racing, and race riding keeps you pretty fit too.\" Jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the British Racing School's training suite in Newmarket. Here resident fitness coach Yariv Kam, a former basketball player, oversees bleep tests, squats (at the wall and standing on wobble cushions), timed sit-ups, push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank. All these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so-called \"Martini glass\" position. This precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills, and this is tested on the \"equisizer\" -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco. Complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket, the equisizer is a lifesize, legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. \"Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first,\" explained Perham. \"In the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time, a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance.\" One meal a day . Maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight. They are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements. In the U.S. and Great Britain, the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys. The majority are naturally slim and slight, so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss, although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds. \"I'm lucky that I can literally eat whatever I want and I won't get any heavier than 53 kg,\" explained Lane, who started riding when he was 12. \"But some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day. Mentally, it's a big task not to be eating.\" The British Racing School also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists. There is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie-counted recipes such as Mexican beans and rice, and spicy sausage hot pot. Not just about the horse . But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races? Perham concedes that the work level is split 90% to 10% in favor of the horse. But Lane, who has ridden more than 350 winners, believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit. \"People say, 'It's the horse, you just have to sit there,' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it,\" he reasoned. \"It may only be 10% us but if we're only 50% fit then the jockey can only commit 5% of the work during a race. \"If we're not as fit as we can be then we're definitely affecting the horse.\" As an example, he cited last weekend's Shergar Cup, a team event held at Britain's Ascot racecourse where jockeys compete for international teams. \"The English and European jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world. You could see at the finish they weren't as strong.\" To show how hard it is to train like a jockey, Perham put World Sport anchor Alex Thomas through his physical tests for CNN's Winning Post show. At the British Racing School, Thomas was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer. He also found he was no match for a professional jockey like Lane. In Perham's fitness assessment, Thomas managed to last 40 seconds in the sit-up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds, and while the average rider could stay in the stomach-clenching plank pose for 180 seconds, the journalist managed a third of that time. \"I knew it was going to be hard but I didn't think it would be that tough,\" Thomas grimaced at the end of his grueling physical. \"Safe to say, I won't be applying for my racing license anytime soon!\" All-round fitness . Not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey, but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred. \"The tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do,\" explained Perham. \"The simulator that I've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it's also very, very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment, similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer. It's an all-round fitness tool.\" While following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the Grand National or Breeders' Cup, Lane agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit. \"It's good for an all-round level of fitness,\" he added. \"Being fit makes everyday life so much easier.\"",

And if there are some who are finding it difficult to look for a suitable match, life needn't be a bitch. There's now a website that's dedicated to their need. With dog mating as its raison d'etre, Internet portal candyromeo.com is a platform for all those canine owners who want a partner for their pet. Claiming to be the country's first matrimonial website for dogs, candyromeo. com offers an opportunity to prospective 'brides' and 'grooms' to meet each other before tying the knot. Yappily Ever After: Kareena is . the owner of the first of its kind . matrimonial website for pet dogs . The brain behind the website, Kareena Abbott, was inspired by her love for dogs to launch it. 'I was in college in England and wanted to do something for dogs,' Abbott said. So, she got together with three friends to launch the website to help people find mates for their pets. 'We knew how difficult it is to mate pets as you can't just pick up a roadside animal for the purpose,' Abbott says. 'People today have become very conscious of the lineage of puppies their pets would have.' The portal draws its name from Abbott's two pet dogs, Candy (a poodle) and Romeo (a pug which has three generations now, all living at their owner's house). The proud owner of 10 dogs says that since she already had a kennel and was into dog breeding, handling the rush of visitors on the website wasn't a difficult task. Canine Coupling: The website candyromeo.com . 'Launching a matrimonial and dog mating website was the next logical step. But theme weddings are all that we charge for.' The idea has picked up well. Popularised solely by word of mouth, the website assisted mating of 1,065 dogs from across the country in its very first year. This year, candyromeo. com has already got 665 registrations. For dogs in Delhi, Abbott holds breeding sessions and weddings at her farm in Sultanpur. For other parts of the country she just connects the owners to each other 'who then take it forward from there'. People living in America are also using the website. Pavni Bagga of California found a match for her Maltese named Skittles in Princess from New Jersey via candyromeo.com. The Roman themed wedding took place on October 26, 2011, with three lavish functions - one in California and two each in India at Abbott's farmhouse. Mutt Matchmaker: Kareena Abbott with one of her pet dogs . 'Skittles and Princess have relatives in India too, so it was easy for the families to travel down and celebrate,' says Bagga. 'They now have three puppies. One lives with us in California and two with Princess in New Jersey.' Abbott has other themes to offer as well to dog owners getting their pets married off. Themes such as the Arabian Nights, New Yorker Nights and Caribbean Nights - the idea is to pamper the dogs. From decorations to the dress code, from the wedding cake to the guest list, from snacks to the after party, everything is done with attention to the minutest details. 'For the Arabian Nights theme, we also organise hookahs for dogs,' says Abbott. 'We are about to launch the 'Exquisite Candy' theme, which comes with a booth offering manicure and pedicure for dogs, and the dress code is Gucci and Prada.' Pet mating is a necessity to keep a dog physically and mentally healthy, but candyromeo. com has gone the extra mile to make a regular activity an occasion for fun.",

        "document": "By . Lucy Waterlow . After decades of male dominance, women are finally making in-roads as racing car drivers. This July, Susie Wolff will be the first woman to take part in a Formula 1 Grand Prix for 22 years as she will test drive cars in her role as a development driver for Williams Martini Racing. And now another female driver is making history as it has been announced that British born Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team. Driving force: Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team . Fast female: The 33-year-old said she's looking forward to speeding through the streets . Katherine, 33, from Surrey, is the first female driver in the Formula E Championship, a new initiative from the FIA which was established in 2012. She said: 'For me this is a really exciting opportunity. The car is fantastic, it looks amazing and it will be very quick. 'Racing through the streets of the world's leading cities will be an incredible experience and I think it's a great chance to bring racing to the people. We will be driving in their cities on their streets.' The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but the engine, power train and power supply are unique. Driven: Katherine is an experienced IndyCar racer . New series: The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but are electric . Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h. The fundamental difference is that these cars are powered by a battery and represent the cutting edge of electric vehicle technology. The research and development supporting the Championship has the potential to radically change transport systems around the world, particularly in urban areas, where air pollution caused by fossil fuels is a serious concern. Serious about winning: Katherine has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford . Cutting edge technology: Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h . Amlin's team, based in Donnington, are led by team principal Mark Preston and are currently preparing for their first race in this new Championship, which will begin in Beijing on 13th September. 'Formula E will be a very exciting and demanding Championship and I think it brings an interesting new dimension to the sport. This is as much about strategy as it is about driving fast - it's playing Chess at 220 km/h, said Mark. CEO of Amlin, Charles Philipps, said he was 'very excited' about the championship and said Katherine has been selected to drive as a a serious podium contender. He said: 'We are serious about racing and serious about winning.' Katherine has been race car driving for years and is a seasoned competitor in the IndyCar series in the U.S. She has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford. In . 2005 she was given RACER Magazine's 'Most Promising Road Racer of The . Year' award - previous winners include Kimi Räikkönen, Jenson Button and . Cristiano da Matta. So could Katharine's career in Formula E lead to become a champion of Formula 1? She has already been behind the wheel of an F1 car having test driven for the Minardi team at Vallelunga near Rome in 2005. Another Brit making history: Susie Wolff is a development driver for the Williams F1 team and will take part in July's Silverstone Grand Prix . One of the team: Susie with her teammates Valtteri Bottas, Felipe Massa and Felipe Nasr . But as Susie Wolff has discovered, breaking into F1 driving isn't easy. Many doubt whether women are physically capable of dealing with the G-forces encountered when F1 driving while former British racing driver Sir Stirling Moss told the BBC in April that he doesn't think women have the 'mental aptitude to race hard, wheel-to-wheel.' Women like Susie and Katherine inevitably have to deal with sexism in the male dominated sport. 'I've lost count of the amount of times I've been asked, \"Do you have a lipstick holder in your car?\",' Susie told the Daily Express last week. She added: 'It's got easier to deal with over time. There will always be comments no matter what you do. You'll always have those that are for you and those that are against you... It's hard for their (men's) egos to cope with a girl beating them.' But with more women taking to the track, men might have to start getting used to it.",

        "document": "By . John Hall . Tragic: Kingsman Dave Shaw was shot while on patrol in Afghanistan's notorious Helmand Province . A Taliban bullet fired from half a mile away killed a soldier by 'pure fluke', an inquest has been told. Kingsman Dave Shaw, 23, was shot on January 14 last year while on patrol supporting Afghan police in Lashkar Gah, capital of Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand Province. Investigators were told the bullet that killed Kingsman Shaw, who was from Barrow in Cumbria, had already 'reached the end of its trajectory, with the coroner describing his death as 'terrible luck'. Kingsman Shaw was killed shortly after his patrol arrived at Pupalzy Shak, a fortified checkpoint surrounded by large walls designed to withstand a direct hit from rocket propelled grenades. The British troops had been at the checkpoint around one hour and 40 minutes when Taliban snipers opened fire from farmland to the north west. The court heard how Kingsman Shaw was struck by a bullet that had 'reached the end of its trajectory' and dipped over the northern wall of the 160 square foot checkpoint. South Cumbria coroner Ian Smith said: 'To say this is bad luck is an understatement, it is terrible.' Major Mark McLellan, commanding officer of the patrol, told the court his men had arrived at the checkpoint at around 7.30am, and had seen no signs of enemy activity. Mr Smith asked: 'In due course did the prevailing conditions outside change; did something happen?' Kingsman Shaw was hit at a distance of half a mile by the fluke bullet . Afghanistan death: Kingsman Dave Shaw was on patrol in Lashkar Gah (pictured), the capital of Helmand Province, when he was shot. He was killed shortly after his patrol arrived at the fortified checkpoint at Pupalzy Shak . Major McLellan replied: 'Yes, there was firing. A short burst of arms went over my head. I gave the order to 'stand to' and everyone got their kit on. Then a second burst came through.' The court heard within one or two seconds of firing Kingsman Shaw and his colleague Sergeant Mark Stevens had both been hit. He said: 'I saw Sergeant Stevens had been hit in the back. At that point I saw Kingsman Shaw put his hand up to his neck, and then the sergeant grabbed him and applied pressure.' Major McLellan described the arc of the shot as 'pure fluke' and said there was no way a bullet could have penetrated the walls of the compound. The court heard that although Kingsman Shaw had removed his 25kg body armour after entering the checkpoint - a choice down to the individual soldier - it still would not have stopped the bullet. Sergeant Stevens, whose body armour saved him from serious injury, said that after reeling under the impact of the bullet he saw Kingsman Shaw was in severe trouble. Fluke: Investigators were told the bullet that killed Kingsman Shaw, whose funeral was held in Barrow, Cumbria (pictured), had already reached the end of its trajectory and dipped over a wall . He said: 'Kingsman Shaw was staring at me and he was pointing at his neck. 'I realised he had been hit and I grabbed him and applied pressure straight away. Then he was taken to the ground... The medic reacted straight away.' Army medic Lance Corporal Rachel Hughes broke down in tears as she told of her attempts to save Kingsman Shaw's life. She said: 'One minute we were standing around chatting and then we were under fire. I reached around to grab my body armour and I saw David cupping his neck with his left hand. 'I blinked for a second and that’s when the Sergeant took him to the ground.' Lance Corporal Hughes told the court how she applied pressure to stop the bleeding and administered a clotting agent. She said Kingsman Shaw lost consciousness and stopped breathing twice before being 'brought back' with CPR. After giving evidence Lance Corporal  Hughes was thanked by Kingsman Shaw’s sister, Sarah. A report by forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Alexander, read by Mr Smith, said: 'He died despite heroic attempts to save his life. It is a testament to his physical fitness and to the care he received that he survived as long as he did.' Popular: Kingsman Dave Shaw (second from right) pictured with friends at his home in Barrow, Cumbria . Dr Alexander stated the cause of death was cerebral infarction, caused by a gunshot wound to the neck. Kingsman Shaw was airlifted to Camp Bastion after around 25 minutes, before being flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he died the following day. Following the inquest Sergeant Stevens, 35, from Lancaster, said: 'He was passionate about his job, and he was a good lad. He was always one of the boys.' Major McLellan said: 'He was a real character, and he had reached the point where other soldiers were starting to look up to him.' Kingsman Shaw's dad David said: 'His colleagues reacted as you would expect, completely professionally. 'Hearing what happens brings home how unlucky it was. There was nothing anyone could have done.' Sarah Shaw said: 'It is nice to know there is no-one to blame. The care he received gave us the chance to say goodbye.' The inquest continues.",

        "document": "Nicholas Totty, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to four rapes during a four-hour rampage through Rotherham . A drug-crazed bodybuilder armed with knives violently raped a woman in the street and a teenager three times in her own home after he smashed his way in. Former Royal Navy chef Nicholas Totty, 25, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years following his four-hour rampage in the Rotherham area of South Yorkshire. A mother was forced to watch her daughter being raped three times by Totty and another woman only escaped a sex attack because her dog frightened him off. Sheffield Crown Court heard powerfully-built 18-stone Totty, who is 6ft 4 inches, was hooked on anabolic steroids and was discharged from the Navy in 2010 for using the drugs. Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said Totty had a girlfriend but had several other affairs. The court heard he had a high sex drive and indulged in violent sexual role plays with women. His rampage began at 9.15pm on Friday, September 27 when he tried to sexually attack a 24-year-old woman as she walked her dog on a footpath alongside a main road in Rotherham. Totty cycled up in front of her and waited in the shadows until he pounced on her with his arm outstretched trying to grab her neck. He made three grabs for her but her dog intervened and jumped up, forcing him to flee. The victim recognised him as someone she knew from school. Totty then went home to check his Facebook but was out on the streets by 11.15pm where he banged on a steelworker’s door hoping to find a woman but made a story up about asking directions. A few minutes later he accosted a 27-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant in the street as she walked home from the town’s railway station. He shone a torch in her face before hitting her with it on the head and pushing her to the ground. He told her if she shouted out he would slit her throat with a chef’s knife and then forced her to twice perform a sex act. He produced some kitchen roll out of a carrier bag which he used to wipe her head wound in a bid to get rid of any evidence. Totty forced his way into the home of a mother and daughter, raping the girl three times while forcing her mother to watch. He also forced a woman who was eight months pregnant to perform a sex act on him while he threatened her with a knife. File picture . After she ran away he caught up with her and ripped off her trousers and underwear but a passing motorist heard the woman’s screams and Totty ran off, leaving a second knife on the ground. Mr Dallas said Totty then tried to get into the home of a woman with whom he had a previous sexual relationship but she slammed the door in his face. The worst attack was on a mother, 46, and her teenage daugher who were at home alone in bed at 12.45am. The mother had lost her husband only weeks before and it is thought Totty may have known he would find her and her daughter alone as he knew the teenager’s relative. Totty smashed his way into the house through the front and inside doors and as the mother dialled 999 he raced upstairs. He pushed them both onto the floor and threatened to kill them before dragging them both by their hair to the bathroom. He forced the teenager to perform a sex act before raping her three times. When her mother tried to intervene, Totty knocked her to the floor and stamped on her face and neck. Totty then suddenly changed and 'became sympathetic' when the mother spoke of her husband’s death. He ran off leaving their mobile phones in the garden. He was arrested three days later after a massive police hunt. Totty admitted four counts of rape, wounding with intent, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and assault with intent to cause sexual offence at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured . Totty, of Whiston, near Rotherham, who lived with his mother and stepfather, admitted four rapes, assault with intent to commit a sexual offence, wounding with intent and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Dermot Hughes, defending, said: 'For the physical and emotional destruction he caused during that rampage he is truly sorry.' 'He wished to address the underlying causes of his offending inside jail and his behaviour was very much out of character. 'He is physically fit, mentally able and could have led a fulfilling and rewarding life,' he said. The judge Mr Justice Globe said of the sex attack on the 27-year-old: 'It was a horrific, life-changing experience for her and his first victim was only saved from a serious sex attack by her dog.' He said the women targeted in their home would have been dwarfed by his large frame and had now been forced to change address. 'Both were left with deep emotional and mental scars and can’t stop thinking about the events and are worried about their safety in the sanctity of their own home,' he said. 'The daughter fears she will be condemned to a lifetime of worry, fear and anxiety.' The judge said a psychiatric report showed Totty had claimed he was hearing voices and thought people were plotting against him but it was all part of him trying to take control of his life as the motive for his offending was 'all linked to your heavy and persistent use of drugs.' There was evidence he had a significant personality disorder and was of a psychopathic disposition, presenting a clear risk to the public which was why he was being given a life sentence. 'There is a clear risk of further random violent sexual crimes,' said the judge. Totty’s victims along with family members packed the public gallery and one woman applauded as he received his sentence.",

        "document": "By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 04:52 EST, 20 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:45 EST, 20 February 2013 . John Coatman has been awarded nearly £70,000 after winning an unfair dismissal case against Salford Council for being sacked after raising concerns about inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse . A council worker sacked after pointing out inaccuracies in a report about children at risk of abuse has been awarded £67,995 in an unfair dismissal case. John Coatman, 59, received the payout after a battle with Salford Council, which started in 2008. He says the case caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke. But Mr Coatman, from Salford, has now said it felt 'fantastic' to know he had won 'after years of hell'. He said: 'Even though the tribunal was a success I still wasn't sure I'd get the pay-out I felt I deserved, so this is very important to me. 'I would have taken £50,000 three years earlier if they had offered it, but this has caused me years of stress.' Mr Coatman won his case after an employment tribunal, which began in September 2011. It heard that he emailed a top Salford council director in 2008 over concerns that figures in his line manager's report on the safety of children at risk of abuse were inaccurate. The council's children's services department was under pressure at the time because it was deemed 'inadequate' by government inspectors. Mr Coatman, a statutory returns analyst, says he raised concerns but they were dismissed and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied before the tribunal. But the tribunal heard Mr Coatman was 'disgusted' and sent an email raising his concerns to Jill Baker - then director of the department. He also sent the email to Ofsted, the Audit Commission and Government Office North West. The figures were eventually rectified, but Mr Coatman alleged that after sending the emails he was threatened with disciplinary action, subjected to intimidating behaviour by some staff and forced to move desks before being suspended. His managers said they suspended him for allegedly communicating with colleagues in a highly inappropriate and threatening manner and failing to follow management requests. At a disciplinary hearing, it was alleged the council's trust and confidence in Mr Coatman had broken down. He claimed the allegations were malicious and took the council to a tribunal, which ruled his dismissal was unfair. His award takes into account loss of earnings and pension over three years. Stress: Mr Coatman said the case has caused him so much stress he suffered a stroke . In 2009, Mr Coatman was admitted to Salford Royal hospital suffering from a minor stroke. He said: 'The doctors couldn't work it out because I was physically fit, I played football and worked out, but then they asked if I'd been experiencing stress, and of course I had. It has been very, very difficult.' Mr Coatman has since found a new job with a management consultancy firm. He said: 'I am enjoying being in work again and even more so because my colleagues are great to work with.' Councillor John Merry, who oversees children's services, said: 'We are in a different place now to when Mr Coatman was employed at the council and action has been taken to improve the service. Ofsted has recently lifted the improvement notice and congratulated officers for the good progress made in the last two years.' Inaccuracies: Mr Coatman says he raised concerns but they were dismissed, and his manager asked him to lie about the figures - which his manager denied. Pictured is Salford Civic Centre, the administrative headquarters of the council .",

        "document": "Kristina Chesterman, a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was killed by a suspected drunken driver last year before she ever got a chance to travel, learn how to fly a plane or ride a camel. But now Susan Vieria, 64, has made a commitment to fulfill all the wishes on the bucket list of the young woman whose heart is beating in her chest. Chesterman, from Livermore, was left brain dead after a car operated by 19-year-old Riley Hoover slammed into her bike just a block from her home near Chico State University campus last September. Unbreakable bond: Kristina Chesterman (left), a 21-year-old nursing student from California, was an organ donor, so when she was killed in a horrific DUI crash last year, her heart went to 64-year-old Susan Vieria (right) Scene: Her destroyed bike (pictured) was carried for another 200 feet by a suspected 19-year-old drunken driver . The beautiful college sophomore was studying to be a nurse because she wanted to save lives, and she was also a registered organ donor - a decision that ended up giving at least five people, Vieria among them, a second chance. Three days after Chesterman’s horrific accident, the 64-year-old South Bay resident, who had suffered congestive heart failure, got a call from Stanford University Hospital saying that a match has been found. ‘I never dreamed in my life, how they would remedy my heart,’ Vieira told the station KCRC. Later that same night, Vieria underwent a successful heart transplant. With her health on the mend, Vieria took to Facebook in order to find her donor's family and express her gratitude for Chesterman's selfless act. The 64-year-old woman and Chesterman's mother, Sandra, met face to face for the first time two weeks ago. Life saver: Kristina Chesterman (right) studied nursing at Chico State University and was committed to helping others any way she could . Second chances: A portion of Chesterman's liver went to a baby boy (left), and one of her kidney's was donated to family friend Sakariah Pappachan (right) ‘I felt an instant connection,’ Sandra Chesterman said. ‘I felt that I've known her for a long time. I felt comfortable right away. Even on the phone talking to her, I felt a connection.’ Although she is in her golden years, Vieria has vowed to Kristina's family that as long as she is physically capable, she will do all the things their daughter had aspired to do in her lifetime. According to the late student's mother, some of the items on Kristina’s extensive bucket list were learning how to pilot a plane, travel around the world and ride a camel. ‘Kristina's waiting there to advise me,’ Miss Vieria said while sitting next to her donor’s mother. According to San Jose Mercury News, the young woman also dreamed of running through a poppy field and flying in a hot-air balloon. Besides Vieria, Chesterman has given a new lease on life to four other people, including two babies, one of whom got a portion of her liver, and family friend Sakariah Pappachan, who received a kidney. Daughter's wish list: Kristina's mother, Sandra Chesterman (right) told Vieria (left) that the 21-year-old wanted to learn how to fly a plane, ride a camel, travel, run through a poppy field and fly in a hot-air balloon . Heart to heart: Mrs Chesterman said she felt instant connection with the elderly woman who now has her daughter's heart beating in her chest . Sandra Chesterman told the paper in February that ever since she was a little girl, Kristina was passionate about helping others. She often donated blood, and at age 18, she registered as an organ donor because it was ‘the right thing to do.’ The student’s family are currently working on building a health clinic in Nigeria that will bear Kristina’s name. Meanwhile, her friends also have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, including skydiving, which Bridget Kline did over the ocean off San Diego recently. Another fiend Chris Leslie took Chesterman’s photo with him when he flew first-class to Japan - something she always wanted to do. Living out her fantasies: Kristina's friends have been busy ticking items off her bucket list, like sky-diving and flying first class . Still dreaming big: Chesterman's family are now building a health clinic in Nigeria in her name . ‘You wonder why someone like that is taken so young, but I believe Kristina was one of those very rare people who was so complete as a person already. ... The rest of us are just a work in progress,’ Leslie told the paper. Riley Hoover, the driver who crashed into Chesterman’s bike September 22, 2013, and then fled from the scene, is currently awaiting trial. He could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted of hit-and-run, DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter.",

        "document": "(Health.com) -- People with depression are more likely to have a stroke than their mentally healthy peers, and their strokes are more likely to be fatal, according to a new analysis published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Depression is a relatively minor risk factor for stroke compared to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other health conditions and behaviors that damage blood vessels, the researchers say. Still, their analysis suggests that as many as 4% of the estimated 795,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year can be attributed to depression. \"If you have depression but no other health issues, you probably don't have to pay too much attention to stroke risk,\" says An Pan, Ph.D., the lead author of the analysis and a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. \"But if you are depressed and are also obese, or have hypertension or...unhealthy lifestyle factors, your risk is going to increase dramatically.\" Health.com: The 10 most depressing states in the U.S. Pan and his colleagues combined data from 28 studies dating back to the mid-1990s that included about 318,000 people overall. Roughly 2.7% of the participants had a stroke during the studies, which ranged in length from two to 29 years. Compared to those who showed no signs of depression, people who received a depression diagnosis from a doctor or who reported feeling depressed were 45% more likely to have a stroke and 55% more likely to die from a stroke, the researchers found. Depression increased the risk of ischemic stroke, in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and cannot send blood to the brain. But it did not measurably raise the risk of the other major type, hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel leaks or bursts open. Health.com: 12 signs of depression in men . The new study is the latest in a long line of research linking depression to chronic disease and serious physical health problems. \"We knew that depression raises a person's risk of developing diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,\" Pan says. \"We also knew that depression can occur after patients suffer a stroke. We just didn't have strong enough evidence to know if the reverse was true, or what really comes first.\" Researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks (and especially fatal ones), so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke, says Norman Rosenthal, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, in Washington, D.C. \"Strokes and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ, whether it's the heart or the brain,\" says Rosenthal, who was not involved in the new study. \"They're essentially the same disease.\" Health.com: Careers with high rates of depression . Depression could contribute to strokes in many ways, Pan says. For starters, people who are depressed are more likely to smoke or drink heavily, to follow an unhealthy diet, and to neglect their personal health. Most of the studies included in the analysis controlled for these and other risk factors, but the data suggests that at least some of the stroke risk in depressed people can be explained by an unhealthy lifestyle. There are other possibilities, as well, that aren't as easily measured. Depression can increase the production of stress hormones in the body, for instance, and can trigger dangerous inflammation in the blood vessels. \"Little things, like keeping up good dental hygiene or socializing with friends, all affect inflammation levels -- and these are things that a depressed person is less likely to do,\" says Rosenthal. Depression may also cause people to slack on taking medications needed to control other stroke-related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. On the other hand, some medications prescribed for depression -- most notably the class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics -- have been shown to cause weight gain and obesity, a known risk factor for stroke. More research is needed to determine whether depression drugs contribute to stroke risk. Doctors should monitor weight gain and blood pressure levels in patients taking these drugs, but there's no reason for patients to stop taking them, Pan says. \"For now, physicians should prescribe medication if they think it is necessary, or if non-drug treatments haven't worked.\" Although depression isn't the most important risk factor for stroke, the researchers say it likely has a noticeable impact on the stroke rate. They estimate that depression is responsible for an additional 106 strokes per 100,000 people in the United States each year. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .",

A Chinese school has solved its problem with a lack of space for a school sports day by using the emergency lane of a nearby motorway. The Xingguo School, in Guiyang, Guizhou province, is a school that mainly has children from rural migrant workers in the city and therefore does not have a lot of resources. It did have a small playground, but this ended up being built on, leaving the kids with nowhere to exercise until teachers came up with the bright idea of using part of the local motorway. Risky: Running races at the school take place on the emergency lane of the motorway . There are about 500 students in the school, but without even a small playground the children need an alternative location. The local council could only tell them that there was nothing suitable where the children could enjoy running or any other form of exercise. Headteacher Manchu Ni, 56, said: ‘We rarely organised sports which require a larger space than we have available. But we were then told that we faced closure if we did not do something as it’s the law that primary school students should have physical fitness test. There was nowhere else we could go. ‘We always stage events after rush-hour and will make sure that teachers stand along the edge of the emergency lane to make sure cars realise the children are there and drive carefully.’ Lack of resources: The school, Guizhou province, doesn't even have a playground . Duty-bound: The headteacher said that the school faced closure if it didn't host sports lessons . The school has now organised several races where the kids have a running test on the road bridge despite the busy traffic. ‘We know it’s dangerous and is also not that healthy with all the smog, but we don’t have any other choice if we are to stay open.’ said the headmaster. Poor: Most of the children belong to low-income rural migrant families .",

        "document": "(CNN)If marrying design and engineering is a fine art, then who better for the job than sailing's answer to \"David Hockney with an iPad?\" Like Hockney, this is man whose canvas is a tablet. His subject? Ultra-slick, quick racing boats. Dirk Kramers, who counts Ted Turner among his former employers, has been tasked with designing a vessel capable of winning the 2017 America's Cup -- sailing's most prestigious race. His new boss is a man who knows a thing or two about winning, multiple Olympic champion Ben Ainslie. The knight of the realm is behind a bold bid to bring the Auld Mug to British shores for the first time. The competition is still two years away but at the temporary home of Ben Ainslie Racing HQ on an industrial estate just outside Portsmouth, they are plotting victory. \"Everyone wants to see the champagne flying at the finish -- that's the sound bites and visual bites that people live for,\" Kramers told CNN. \"But the main chapters of this are being written now. The America's Cup is being won now.\" BAR's temporary base -- they will relocate to a bigger headquarters next May on Portsmouth's waterfront -- gives little indication of the expertise at work with its white, spartan interior. Inside there are decades worth of experience among the 55-strong workforce, which will rise to near 100 by the time of the Cup. Money and cutting-edge technology are key to this operation but, for Kramers, who modestly downplays himself as \"the old guy on the team\", the most valuable ingredient is far more simplistic. \"Most of the time it's not the biggest spender that wins,\" says the American. \"The most expensive commodity is time. You're always learning and it's the person that learns the most that will have the fastest boat.\" With every minute precious in the countdown to the big race, no wonder the pictorial greeting on the first flight of stairs from the entrance for any visitor to Team HQ is a quote from Muhammad Ali: \"Don't count the days, make the days count.\" \"In terms of setting structure and design philosophy, that happens now,\" says Ainslie as he reflects on the process of filling key management roles before steadily expanding the sailing, design and on-shore workforce . \"If we get this bit wrong, we'll never recover. And unfortunately until we're on the start line, we won't know for sure how we've done.\" Ainslie's first call was to Andy Claughton, the team's technical director. In Formula One terms, he is like an Adrian Newey, who has since signed up to the BAR project, to a Sebastian Vettel during their time together at Red Bull. Claughton competed in the same era as Ainslie's coach Sid Howlett and has been involved in America's Cup racing since 1983. He and Ainslie got to know each other during the 2007 America's Cup when Ainslie was part of the Team New Zealand set-up. A keen engineer for as long as he can remember, Claughton likens the project to, \"a Mecano set -- you have to make sure you pick all the right bits.\" But, because of the sheer numbers involved, he admits \"it's like playing rugby with 100 players.\" Fortunately for Claughton, it's not a case of starting from scratch. \"The thing is that someone's always done something similar before so there are rules of thumb,\" he explains. \"A lot of projects aren't rocket science. We're not going to invent some new technology that will win us the Cup. What we will do is reassemble existing technology that can help us.\" That starts with the simplicity of a Kramers sketch either on paper or more often an iPad, which he started to use to share his ideas more easily with his colleagues. This is then fed into a 3D computer model overseen by Francesco Azevedo. Portugal's Azevedo is one of 11 nationalities currently represented on the design team, which also prides itself on a \"best of British\" approach. A rarity on the team as an America's Cup debutant, the former architect explains: \"I try to model the ideas from everybody and try to make it as a 3D model so everyone can sit around and discuss. \"Everyone feeds it into me and I try to give everyone feedback because sometimes ideas clash and you cannot physically fit them together so I try to come up with solutions and present solutions to everybody else and say 'this idea didn't really work - what about this?'\" How versatile the team can be with their design is curtailed by the America's Cup rule book. For example, it tells you the boat must have two hulls a certain length apart and be of a certain length and width. \"Under the rules, it quickly becomes clearer in a picture what the boat looks like,\" adds Claughton. \"To the naked eye, all the boats will look similar. The disparity will come as these boats are fantastically difficult to sail. There's lots of opportunity to do things well and badly.\" The designers may use a wind tunnel to test a certain part but the computational tools at their disposal are so accurate it is not always required. So once sent through the 3D model, individual parts are sent to an external supplier with the touch of a button and, as Claughton says, \"it turns up in a box at the end of the week.\" Deciding how long to spend designing products while also minimizing manufacturing time is a balancing act. The first testing boat (T1) is already out on the water, T2 is expected to be fully operational in May while the eventual boat on which Ainslie and his team will race for the Cup is set to be finalized in design terms by the end of next year's sailing season. \"There is an end point and that's the $64,000 question when that is,\" explains Claughton. \"You're balancing pushing the design time but also the amount of time the guys can spend on the water.\" A myriad of different organizations are on board with Ainslie's team from the British Ministry of Defence to big players in aerospace and engineering company Prodrive, which boasts a rich motorsport history. And while the majority of the staff have been picked for their America's Cup pedigree, others have been headhunted from elsewhere. James Roche is the boyfriend of British Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and previously worked at UK Sport and latterly McLaren Applied Technologies. He helped design the sleds that Yarnold and, before her, Amy Williams, drove to Olympic glory. His role at Ben Ainslie Racing is simulation support and the once budding sailor is adamant his skills translate from ice to water. \"It's engineering and optimization and working with athletes with equipment so there are a lot of parallels,\" he says. His job is to work on performance prediction programs and writing code to foresee how the boat will behave and react with sailors and new equipment. But for all the brains and cutting-edge technology behind it, there is no guarantee this $130 million project will ultimately prove successful. \"That's the elephant in the room,\" admits Claughton, though the buzz through the open-plan office suggests a team brimming with confidence that it is currently on the right path. Ultimately, Ainslie is a fiercely determined sailor and he is adamant the team can \"bring back the Cup to Britain\" for the first time in the event's history. Time will tell.",

Cruel: Angela Maier poisoned her friend and sister-in-law which saw them miscarry . Two pregnant woman miscarried after a jealous friend poisoned their drinks, a court in Austria has heard. Secretary Angela Maier, 26, was desperate to have a baby of her own but suffered three miscarriages. The depressed woman was consumed with jealousy when she then learned that her sister-in-law and best friend were pregnant. Maier told a court in Klagenfurt, Austria: 'I couldn't stand the thought of them having babies who would be growing up when mine was dead. 'Mine should have been with them as well, but instead mine died while theirs went on.' She was suffering from depression as a result of her loss and the sight of her friend's impending births. The woman cruelly poisoned the expectant mothers' drinks with medicine she was prescribed after her miscarriage. The court heard how the woman and her best friend had become pregnant at the same time, and had been shopping for baby clothes and planning together. The friend said: 'I asked for a glass of water, and she said she had a special drink for pregnant women, that she didn't need any more. 'A short while later I started to bleed, and then I lost the baby. When I found out what she had done, I wrote back and told her she was a murderer. I can't forgive her.' Two months later she invited her sister-in-law to visit and did the same thing again, mixing the medicine into her hot chocolate, and then 'watched me as I drank it', the victim told the court.

Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her . This is the elderly woman who passed at her California retirement home after one of its nurses refused to give her CPR. The 87-year-old woman, identified as Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Bakersfield, California facility on Tuesday. Though a nurse quickly called 911, she refused to give the woman CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department. 'Not at this time,' said the nurse, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help. It was later revealed that Ms Bayless . had signed a Do Not Resuscitate form, and it is against the policy of . the retirement home to give CPR to residents against their wishes. The executive director at Glenwood, Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the individual needing attention until such personnel arrives. ‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident . Scroll down for video . An 87-year-old woman identified as Lorraine Bayless collapsed in the dining facility of Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California; an on-duty nurse refused to give her CPR . At the beginning of the Tuesday . morning call, the nurse asked for paramedics to come and help the woman . who had collapsed in the home's dining room and was barely breathing. Halvorson . pleaded for the nurse to perform CPR, and after several refusals she . starts asking her to find a resident, or a gardener, or anyone not . employed by the home to get on the phone, take her instructions and . help the woman. NBC affiliate KGET reported that Ms Bayless, a resident of Glenwood Gardens’ independent living facility, collapsed in the dining room Tuesday morning. The nurse on duty, who identified herself as Colleen, called 911 and was patched to the Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher. The dispatcher begged for the nurse to give the woman CPR, even though it was against her wishes and against the retirement community policy. Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener. The nurse refused, saying: ‘I can’t do that.’ The director for Glenwood Gardens said the woman had signed a DNR form, and that it was against policy to administer CPR in independent living facilities . Obviously frustrated, the dispatcher . said: ‘I don’t understand why you’re not willing to help this patient… I . understand if your boss is telling you you can’t do it. ‘But…as a human being… you know…is there anybody that’s willing to help . this lady and not let her die,’ Halvorson asked. EMT workers arrived around seven minutes after the 911 call was placed and Ms Bayless was taken to Mercy Southwest Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her daughter, who is also a nurse, later told KGET that she was satisfied with the retirement home’s handling of the incident.",

A man who had his penis chopped off by a gipsy gang has been named locally as Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt. The 40-year-old was mutilated in a horrific attack in the early hours of Thursday morning in Middlesbrough. He was rushed to hospital and put into an induced coma, but is now conscious and in a stable condition, police confirmed. Attack: It's believed that Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt (pictured) is the man who had his penis cut off and subsequently placed in an induced coma . Affection: Mr Hewitt's Facebook profile picture shows him kissing a blonde woman . Possible connection: The man was attacked near a gipsy campsite on John Boyle Road on Teesside . Motive: It's thought that the gipsy gang (not necessarily connected to the picture) cut off the man's penis for sleeping with one of their girlfriends . Standstill: Police closed a busy dual carriageway to hunt for a man's penis after he was discovered severely injured at the side of the road . Distressed: The 40-year-old was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 dual carriageway in Middlesbrough on Thursday morning, Cleveland Police have confirmed . Probe: A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident and was released on bail . Police brought a busy dual carriageway . to a standstill to hunt for Mr Hewitt's penis after he was discovered . severely injured at the side of an A-road. Mr Hewitt is thought to be a father-of-five although it's not clear who the mother is. On social networking sites Leanne Trewhitt, appeared to identify herself as one of his children. She wrote on Facebook: 'Think I've felt every emotion there possibly is today, thanks for all your kind messages my phone hasn't stopped. My dad's stable now just hoping for a speedy recovery.' Her friends flooded her page with get-well messages after she posted the above note. Mr Hewitt indicated he had a previous relationship with a lady named on social networking sites as Carla Hill. However, it is unclear if she is the mother of his children or if they are still a couple. Cleveland police said: 'The victim remains in hospital and is now conscious. Officers visited him today but were unable to carry out a detailed interview. They hope to speak to him today or tomorrow to establish exactly how his injuries were sustained. Inquiries are on-going.' Mr Hewitt was discovered in a distressed state on the side of the A66 . dual carriageway. He often stays at gipsy campsites in Middlesbrough, including Haven Travellers Site, according to his Facebook page, and recently commented on a meal he ate at a McDonald's on the A66. Facebook comment: Mr Hewitt recently posted a message about a meal he had at McDonald's on the A66, close to where he was attacked . He joked on March 3 about dreading going to work. Dr Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost. He said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, the options are limited. 'It may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery. Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also have to be reconstructed.' A . member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he . heard that a man had suffered the horrendous injury to his groin. He added: 'A few of the Asda staff have been talking and apparently it was some gipsy men doing it to another guy after they found out he had slept with one of their girlfriends. 'I don't know his name but that seems to be what I have heard.' Although police at the time would only say that the . man had suffered serious injuries and wounds to his groin area, around eight officers were seen combing a grass verge at the side of the road, while tape was used to seal off a section of the carriageway. It's believed that they were searching for the missing body part. Officers search the verge of the dual carriageway for the man's organ and other forensic evidence . A member of staff at Asda close to where the incident happened said he heard the victim had suffered a horrendous injury to his groin . Road block: This stretch of the A66 was sealed off by police investigating the incident . The road closed some time between 4.20am . and 9am and was open again by midday. The police closed east bound . carriageway first while they searched, then west bound. A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident was held in police custody on Thursday. He was bailed pending further enquiries. Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am and was taken to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Ambulance: Mr Hewitt was found at 4.50am with serious injuries and was taken to hospital . Investigation: Officers were said to be 'keeping an open mind' as to how the man was injured . 'The road closures were required as part of the investigation into how the man received his injuries,' said a police spokesman. 'This . is necessary so that officers can look for anything which may shed . light on how he became injured or his direction of travel.' The police had taped off a Vauxhall Zafira on a nearby gipsy site. He added: 'If the road was not closed any evidence could be lost or destroyed.' 'Investigations are at a very early stage.' Missing: It is understood that his penis had been cut off and was missing, prompting officers to close sections of the route in order to search for it . The spokesman added: 'Officers are keeping an open mind as to how he received his injuries and key to this will be speaking to the man himself when they are able to do so.' A second man who did not wish to be named said: 'I work on an industrial site close to where it happened. 'When I came into work this morning it was bedlam because the whole place was at a standstill. 'Nobody has told us what has happened, we heard there had been a body found and that there had been a stabbing but these could just be rumours.' Mr Nim Christopher, a leading expert in penile reconstruction at University College London Hospitals, told MailOnline: ‘For a complete penile reconstruction, a procedure called a free flap phalloplasty is performed. This involves taking a chunk of tissue still intact (in terms of nerves, veins, arteries) from another part of the body. This is then rolled into a tube like a sausage roll with a pipe inside it for the urethra.’ Parts of the body where skin may be taken from are the arm or the thigh. The tissue is then transplanted onto the groin area and the nerves, arteries and veins are connected. Cosmetic surgery is then performed to give the transplanted penis the appearance of one that has been circumcised. The whole procedure usually takes three operations and sensation – if it returns at all – can take a long time while the nerves heal. If a man wishes to be sexually active, he can undergo surgery to have a ‘penis pump’ device implanted. Here, two cylinders are placed either side in the tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. Squeezing the pump fills the cylinders with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. This type of surgery can be very successful and save sexual relations when all else has failed. But there are some risks attached to the operation, though, including infection and damage to the penis. A man who had been walking his dog through the area when police started closing the roads said: 'From what I could gather there had been some sort of stabbing. 'I asked an officer what was going on and he said there was no risk to the public but someone had been seriously injured, they said it was just an individual incident though.' A man working in nearby ScS Sofas said: 'There has been a heavy police presence in the area all day, they have been walking around the area and generally chatting to public. 'Lots of people have said there had been a stabbing but that they had heard it from someone else so it was probably just rumours. 'Whatever it was it must have been pretty serious for them to have closed the roads for so long, it was a nightmare getting into work this morning. 'People have been coming in and asking if we knew what had happened but we had no idea either. 'I instantly thought it must have been a road accident seeing as they closed the roads.' A lady taking her shopping from Asda said: 'I know there has been a man hurt but there hasn't been much else said on the matter. 'There . is a lot of gossip about a stabbing but it could just be rumours with a . lot of people speculating over what it could be and coming to their own . conclusions.' Two community support officers who were patrolling said a man had been seriously injured earlier today. They said 'no comment' when asked if a man's penis had been chopped off. All road closures have now been lifted.",

The water isn’t clear and you often can’t see what’s in there, among the many other risks. 'No police officer wants to tell a family their loved one has been killed doing something silly. I know it might look very enticing but go to a proper pool where there are rescue facilities.' And a spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It is very unsafe and we don’t say that just to take a nanny state stance.Going from experience, we have been put in a position where we have to attempt to rescue people from canals but often we only succeed in recovering a body. 'Because the effects of cold water can be so sudden, a rescue is not possible. There is a very real risk of injury and death.' Up to 760 people have lost their lives as a result of Britain's blistering heatwave with the figures set to rise, experts warn. A heatwave death toll has been calculated by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) for The Times. Researchers used temperature data supplied by the Met Office and compared the figures with previous studies conducted on deaths during heatwaves in Britain. They found that between 540 and 760 people will have perished in England alone during the first nine days of the heatwave and warn the figures could easily double in the coming days.",

Three people died and 23 were injured in the other attacks. In those explosions, a roadside bomb in western Baghdad killed one person, and a roadside bomb in the city of Hilla in Babil province, south of Baghdad, killed two people.

        "document": "England are less than 12 months away from a home World Cup but have just lost four Tests on the trot to New Zealand and one to South Africa. The game with Australia on Saturday week is now ‘must-win’. But do the southern-hemisphere nations agree that England are in crisis? NIK SIMON asked three legends… . MICHAEL LYNAGH (72-cap Australia fly half, 1991 Rugby World Cup winner) Michael Lynagh won the 1991 World Cup . It’s not time to press the panic button just yet but there was not a lot of creativity in England’s play at the weekend. That played into South Africa’s hands because they’re a physical side that love people running straight at them. Owen Farrell hasn’t played a lot of rugby this season and it’s not an easy task to find your feet against New Zealand and the Springboks. Maybe he wasn’t quite ready. I think there’s an option to have George Ford come in at No 10, with Owen at 12. It gives you more options with kicking and also two ball-players that can stand either side of the ruck. Defensively Owen is very strong at inside centre and he’s used to playing alongside Brad Barritt, who has been at 13. Maybe it’s time for Ben Youngs to have a go at scrum half against Samoa and show us what he’s got, but the most important thing is getting a win over Australia. Owen Farrell has been criticised for his displays against New Zealand and South Africa . The Saracens fly half could be moved to inside centre, but seems unlikely to start the next game at 10 . SEAN FITZPATRICK (92-cap former All Blacks skipper) Sean Fitzpatrick is a legendary All Black . England are going through a building phase but they will be disappointed with the performance against South Africa. They should be a bit harder on themselves but, in the context of where they were three years ago, they have made huge strides. As fans here we want England to win and the nice thing is now people are expecting them to win. Injuries have not helped their cause and South Africa at Twickenham is a game they would have targeted as a win. The fact that southern-hemisphere players are being contracted to their union also certainly helps, especially in the autumn. It makes them almost like a club team. That’s where the northern hemisphere are going to struggle against the southern hemisphere. Perhaps the RFU should look to buy out the clubs. George Ford, who came on in both games, could start for England in the next fixture against Samoa . THINUS DELPORT (Former South Africa and Gloucester full back) Thinus Delport played 18 times for South Africa . The guys all looked very nervous at Twickenham and England must learn to handle the pressure and expectation that will come over the next 12 months. South Africa had less possession and territory in the first half but capitalised on ill-discipline and unforced errors — a lot of that is down to pressure and in particular the decision-making at 9, 10 and 12. Unfortunately pressure is building on the England set-up from all angles. How they handle that will be crucial to their chances of winning the World Cup. They can go out for a beer, but if they get caught out by the media and then the result doesn’t go their way, then it becomes the wrong thing to do. But it can swing both ways and England have to find that balance between focus and relaxation very quickly. England could call on Ben Youngs to help break the malaise in the half-back positions . The Autumn Internationals on Sky Sports are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international, European and domestic game.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman visiting her mother in Oregon is suing her neighbor and seeking $275,000 for pain, suffering and other damages that she says were inflicted when a pet duck ambushed her for no apparent reason. Cynthia Ruddell, 62, of Washougal, Washington, was on her mother's property in Estacada, Oregon, about 25 miles southeast of Portland, when a neighbor's duck attacked her without warning. According to the suit filed in Oregon state court last Friday, in her attempt to run away from the agitated swan, Ruddell fell to the ground, breaking her right wrist and spraining an elbow and shoulder. Scroll down for video... Quack attack: An Oregon woman is getting sued for a whopping $275,000 after her pet duck allegedly attacked a woman on the street, breaking the woman¿s wrist and spraining her elbow . The incident occurred in May 2012. The complaint accuses the bird's owner, Lolita Rose, of failing to maintain control of her pet or 'to warn or otherwise inform neighbors of her duck's dangerous propensity in attacking individuals.' Ruddell, a retired nurse, is seeking up to $275,000 in damages, including roughly $25,000 for medical expenses, with the remainder being for pain, suffering and the toll her injuries have taken on her daily life. 'These injuries, some of which may be permanent in nature, have caused her, and continue to cause her pain, suffering, inconvenience, humiliation and interfere with [her] normal and usual activities and have caused her permanent scarring all to her noneconomic damage in an amount to be determined by a jury, but are currently estimated not to exceed $250,000,' the lawsuit states.Ruddell said she has about $25,000 in medical bills so far because of her injuries. The lawsuit claims Rose should’ve known that the duck could be violent, and that the Oregon woman should be on the hook for negligence and the medical bills. Duck face: Cynthia Ruddell says a duck (not pictured) caused her to fall, leading her to file a negligence lawsuit against the duck's owner . 'As the possessor of a domestic animal that the defendant knew, or had reason to know, had abnormally dangerous propensities in attacking people in an aggressive manner similar to how it attacked and injured Mrs. Ruddell, defendant is strictly liable for all injuries her duck caused Mrs. Ruddell' the suit goes on to say. Ruddell's lawyer, Gregory Price, said it was his understanding that Rose had her duck killed after the incident. Rose could not be reached for comment on the case. Price said he expects the damages will ultimately be paid by Rose's insurance policy, but filing a lawsuit was necessary as a precaution because of continuing medical bills from a second surgery on his client's wrist and a two-year statute of limitations on such claims. Along with the lingering effects of the attack, the legal case has brought Ruddell a measure of unwanted attention, her attorney said. 'I've learned a lesson,' he said. 'In any future lawsuit I'll talk about my client being attacked by a domestic animal. Not by a duck.'",

        "document": "Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Saturday that \"most [Department of Defense] civilians placed on emergency furlough during the government shutdown will be asked to return to work beginning next week.\" Under Secretary of Defense Robert F. Hale said close to 90% of the 350,000 members of the civilian workforce will be called back. \"My guess is that we will bring most of them back and no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough. And it may be substantially less than that,\" said Hale. The ongoing government shutdown left more than 800,000 workers furloughed since Tuesday. Cruz promised Republican victory in shutdown fight . Hagel said Pentagon and Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys concluded that the law allows the DOD to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members. \"We immediately began working with the Department of Justice on how to implement it,\" said Hale, \"and the Department expressed the opinion that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all DOD civilians. The Department of Justice did say that we could undertake a careful review of civilians who support members of the armed forces and determine who to recall. Needless to say, this is a difficult process and a very time consuming one.\" Hale said officials established a series of categories for civilians who will return to work and those who will not. The first group to return will be \"accepted civilians, the ones that are working right now connected to military operations and the safety of life and property.\" Obama blames Boehner for ongoing shutdown . \"We will recall a category of civilians who provide ongoing support to military members on an ongoing basis like health care, family programs, training and maintenance and commissaries. We will also recall a second category of civilians whose work, if interrupted by a lapse for a substantial period, could cause future problems for military members. Falling in this category is acquisitions, program oversight, contract logistics, financial management, supply chain management,\" said Hale. The group that will not be recalled from furlough includes staff who are \"less directly related to military members,\" said Hale. Those that will not be recalled include some of the Information staff, some of the legislative and public affairs staff, the deputy chief management officer staff, auditors and staff working in non-DOD activities. House passes measure to bring military chaplains back to work . \"Because of the letter of the law and the advice from the DOJ we had to identify those with the less direct effect on military members,\" said Hale. Just hours before the announcement, the House passed a bill providing back pay to federal workers who were furloughed. It's unclear when the Senate might vote on the bill. On Friday, the White House said the president would sign such a measure. Speaker John Boehner and GOP House leadership held the vote as part of a strategy to pass piecemeal spending legislation that addresses the issues brought up by the shutdown. Although Democrats oppose the incremental approach, saying it amounts to conservatives choosing to fund programs and services they like, the bill passed with strong bipartisan support. Retroactive pay is provided under the bill, but federal workers can't expect paychecks until after the government shutdown ends and Congress reaches a resolution on the budget. Hagel's announcement guarantees that many of the Defense Department workers no longer have to wait on Congress in order to go back to work. Shutdown sidelines U.S. Merchant Marine Academy cadets .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Mobile World Congress returned to form this year, with Samsung, Sony, and Huawei all choosing to launch flagship devices in Barcelona. These are my picks from the show: . Nokia X . Just months after being sold to Microsoft, Nokia chose to launch its first Android phones. The devices, all dubbed Nokia X, will run Android but be packed with Microsoft services like OneDrive and Skype. The company says the budget phone will enable Microsoft to enter emerging markets it currently can't reach, but whether they still feel that way when Microsoft takes control in March remains to be seen. Samsung Galaxy S5 . Samsung launched a much more sensible, more cohesive smartphone than previous Galaxy S devices. There's a finger print scanner, a heart rate monitor, new camera tricks, and a clever way of making your downloads faster by combining Wi-Fi and signal coverage together. Samsung also announced a fitness band with a curved OLED screen as it continues its push into wearables. Expect to want the gold one come April. Sony Xperia Z2 . The Sony Xperia Z1 was very well received. However, the Z2 sports the latest Qualcomm processor, bringing with it a stack of improvements. That's the main takeaway here for Sony. Harder, better, faster, stronger, as Daft Punk would say. Early reports and a my own \"hands-on\" test suggest this is going to be one of the best Android phones released this year. Huawei MediaPad X1 . There are two ways to talk up your shiny new powerful tablet. The first is to let it quietly sell on the merits of what you include; the second is to do that and then make sure everyone that comes to your press conference knows how good it is by you trashing the nearest competition - in this case the Nexus 7 and the iPad mini. An amazingly crisp screen, slim form factor, 4G LTE capabilities and a price that is aggressive all help. A Bluetooth battery . Mobile World Congress is not all about state-of-the-art handsets. One gadget that caught my eye is the Tethercell. It appears to be an AA battery, but it's actually a case for a AAA battery. The case is also Bluetooth enabled, so after placing it in your child's noisy toy, you can shut it off with your phone when playtime gets too much to bear. Peace and quiet. How lovely.

        "document": "Nature is more often a display of  majestic beauty: Imagine peacocks fanning their feathers in the sunlight, graceful cheetahs racing across the savannah and technicoloured fish basking in warm waters. But alongside these exquisite displays is a dark underworld of misfits – creatures so ugly and strange they have been described as the ‘counterculture of the natural world.’ From the ‘hipster toad’ with a weaponised moustache to a ‘werewolf mouse’ who howls at the moon, these animals are the antidote to nature’s show-offs. Scroll down for videos . The hardest bat in the world: This long-eared bat has a taste for scorpions. After killing the scorpion, the bat carries it back to a roost and eats it head-first. Usually it eats the whole thing, including the stinger and poison gland . Now, some of the most bizarre examples of these creatures have been compiled in New Scientist’s ‘Mavericks and Misfits of the Animal Kingdom’ publication. Take, for instance, ‘the hardest bat in the world.’ Lurking in isolated patches of desert across Morocco and the Middle East, desert long-eared bats seem to be fearless. In one experiment a team of scientists from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, caught eight bats and watched them hunt scorpions in their lab. The bats ignored dead prey, only attacking live ones that moved. They also showed an interest in boxes containing live scorpions, suggesting they were homing in on sound. Misfits: On the left is a hipster toad that boasts a weaponised moustache and on the right is a unique turtle that urinates through its mouth . The mouse that howls at the moon: In the dark expanses of the Sonoran desert in the US, a terrifying creature stalks the night, searching for fresh meat. Anything will do: crickets, rodents, tarantulas – the nastier the better . Fish with its genitals on its head: The male fish, a Phallostethus cuulong, his reproductive organs by his face. He weaves between drifting vegetation in the sluggish waters of a canal. He closes in on a female, swims alongside her and tries to mate . When a bat landed on a scorpion, it immediately tried to bite the scorpion’s head. Once the scorpion was dead, the bat carried it back to a roost and ate it head-first. Another oddity is the Texas horned lizard. To scare other creatures, it first turns side-on advertising both its length and the spines running down its body. If that’s not enough, it inflates its body like a balloon and shows off the two horns on its head. As a last resort, the lizard will assault the predator by squirting a jet of blood out of its eyes. This extreme weapon confuses the predator allowing the crafty lizard to escape. Emei moustache toads, meanwhile, grow spines on their upper lip to spike rivals males. Just like a human moustache is meant to signify masculinity, these toads display their upper lip with pride. The hipster toads can be found showing off their moustaches in New York’s Williamsburg, London’s Hackney and San Francisco’s Mission district. Then there is the turtle that urinates through its mouth. When the Chinese soft-shelled creatures need to urinate, it does so by sticking its heads into a puddle of water and wiggling its tongue. Several years ago, scientists discovered that the turtles carry a gene that produces a specialised protein to help expel urine. However, this gene was expressed in their mouths, rather than their kidneys. Horror lizard squirts tears of blood: If ever there was an animal that said 'don't even think about eating me', it would be the Texas horned lizard. It has more defences than the Death Star, ranging from camouflage to bony spines on its head. It can also squirt a jet of blood out of its eyes . Super-sensing sea cow: Manatees' hairs, it turns out, are like whiskers turning them into super-sensors. However, their sensitive hairs can only pick up objects within a few metres, which doesn't stop them from being attacked by speeding boats . Bigger eyes than its brains: The eyes are the most distinctive thing about tarsiers, rivalling those of orangutans for size. A tarsier’s eyes are truly enormous in proportion to the rest of the body, typically 1.5cm in diameter, whereas the entire tarsier is only 12cm long . The male Iberian emerald lizard has a blue head and green body which helps them blend into their background when viewed from above . It's the holy grail for Harry Potter and Star Trek fans, but it seems a bright blue headed lizard has already developed its own invisibility cloak. Biologists were baffled as to how male Iberian emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring. While the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate, it should also make them easy for predators to spot. However, researchers from the University of Valencia in Spain and the Unviersity of Porto, Portugal, have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry birds of prey - their own cloaking device. They discovered that the lizards' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from. When viewed from above, the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds. However, when viewed from ground level, the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate. Dr Guillem Pérez i de Lanuza, a biologist at the University of Porto, say their findings are the first evidence of iridescent colours being used by animals to alter their visibility depending on viewing angle. He said: 'Our results suggest that the blue heads are less striking for a bird above the lizard than a lizard in the same plane. Birds see a less UV pure colour that is more whitish and less chromatically conspicuous when seeing the lizards from above.' But the Chinese soft-shelled turtle isn’t as bizarre as the ‘werewolf mouse’. In the dark expanses of the Sonoran desert in the US, the creature stalks the night, searching for fresh meat. Dubbed the southern grasshopper mouse, it has a habit of standing on its hind legs and letting out a dramatic, high-pitched howl once it has killed its prey. Another creature to make the list of misfits is the male fish, a Phallostethus cuulong, which is just 2cm (0.7 inches) long. When attempting to mate with a female, a Phallostethus cuulong swims alongside her, with his head is right next to the female’s head. This might seem like a misguided tactic, but actually he’s doing it right – because the fish’s genital are on his head. The spotted salamander, meanwhile, have eggs that often contain single-celled green algae. Biologists strongly suspect it is a symbiotic relationship. The embryos release waste which the algae feed on, while the algae photosynthesis and release oxygen. This makes it the first solar-powered vertebrate. These oddities of evolution have survived for millions of years, and in many cases they have been around far longer than humans have. They are also a treasure trove of information for scientists. In their genes they carry records of past evolution, of how life on Earth has changed over millions of years. They may not be as graceful as a gazelle or as beautiful as a hummingbird, but they are just as fascinating.

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:25 EST, 10 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:24 EST, 10 December 2013 . Three courts have now denied the efforts of an animal rights group that was pushing for chimpanzees to be granted the same rights as human beings. The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three different lawsuits in an effort to get four chimps- Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo- the legal rights ‘to bodily liberty’ but the courts rejected their arguments. Tommy, the 26-year-old ape, is owned by Pat Levery in Gloversville, New York, and in spite of the animal rights’ group claims that the animal is confined in a ‘prison’, Mr Levery said that the cage where Tommy lives in is completely adequate. ‘I’d be happy to show you Tommy’s home, to show you how well he is cared for,’ Mr Levery told CNN after the ruling against the lawsuit was announced. Remaining with their owners: Three lawsuits in New York have kept chimpanzees (similar to those above) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary . The group sought to have a court-backed order handed out that would free the four chimps from their caged confines, allowing them to live the rest of their lives in a primate sanctuary. 'In this case, we are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous,' the group’s founder Massachusetts lawyer Steven Wise said. 'That is, being able to self-determine, be self-aware, and be able to choose how to live their own lives.' Even before the rejected verdicts were handed down, Wise said he didn’t expect the decisions to be favorable because the judges have no legal precedent to rely on. He added: 'We'll take it to the Appellate Division and then the state Court of Appeals. We've been preparing for lawsuits for many years. These are the first in a long series of suits that will chip away at the legal thinghood of such non-human animals as chimpanzees.' The national group says it is dedicated to changing the common law status of some species other than humans. The group's board of directors includes Wise and chimpanzee research pioneer Jane Goodall. The lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities, such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices, and display complex emotions such as empathy. 'Once we prove that chimpanzees are autonomous, that should be sufficient for them to gain legal personhood and at least have their fundamental interests protected by human rights,' Wise said. Against his will: A nonhuman rights group sued a couple in New York for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named Tommy (who is not pictured above) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case . If the lawsuits had succeeded, similar ones were planned on behalf of other species considered autonomous, such as gorillas, orangutans, whales, dolphins and elephants. Tommy’s lawsuit was filed in the state Supreme Court in Fulton County, while a different one was filed in Niagara Falls on behalf of Kiko who currently lives in a cage in a brick building. Kiko’s owners Carmen and Christie Presti have said they plan to move Kiko and other monkeys to a new facility on a large rural property. The third lawsuit were filed on behalf of the remaining two chimpanzees who are used as part of locomotion research at Stony Brook University on Long Island. All three have since been rejected. David Favre, a professor of animal law at Michigan State University who's not part of the lawsuit, said chimpanzees ought to have recognition within the legal system. He said animals typically are protected by anti-cruelty and animal welfare laws, but prosecutors often don't pursue animal cruelty complaints. He called the lawsuits 'unprecedented' and said if they had succeeded, 'it would be the first time a court has been willing to step forward and examine the living conditions that a particular chimpanzee is in, and take jurisdiction over the chimpanzee and move it someplace more suitable to its needs.'",

The Portuguese Football Federation confirmed Ronaldo has been ruled out of the clash against Mexico in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Saturday, along with defender Pepe and midfielder Raul Meireles. The Real Madrid forward has been struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there are serious fears he may miss Portugal’s opening game of the World Cup against Germany on June 16.

Raising the bar: Ronaldo still has a little way to go before confirming his fitness for the finals . ‘The situation is evolving and our expectations are evolving constantly,’ Portugal boss Paulo Bento told reporters in Foxborough, when asked when the 29-year-old would be fit. ‘When he’s ready to play is a decision that will be made just like any other player, regardless of who it is. As soon as he is ready to train, we will make that announcement. ‘We have to prepare for Germany regardless. The decision of if he will play and when is up to me, the player and the doctors. Ronaldo is not the only good player we have.’ Portugal will play their final warm-up game on Tuesday against Republic of Ireland before flying from the United States to Brazil. Despite his injuries, Ronaldo has spoken of his desire to win the World Cup with his national side. And while the national team captain admits Portugal are not favourites for the World Cup – they have been drawn in a group with Germany, Ghana and the United States – he said he would like to win a title with the national team ‘one day’. Relaxed: Ronaldo missed the friendly with Greece but was in jovial mood alongside Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao . ‘We aren’t favourites but we will try to perform our best as always.

The couple were seen leaving Sydney Airport on Sunday morning and later arrived with the Communications Minister at a Liberal Party fundraiser in Woollahra, eastern Sydney. The trio appeared relaxed until Mr Panton became caught up in the media scrum at the event which prompted Mr Turnbull to shout 'where's David' before reaching out to save him. This came just hours after Prime Minister Tony Abbott moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out of the leadership challenge. Scroll down for video . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and partner David Panton pictured at Sydney Airport on Sunday morning . The couple were heading to a Liberal Party fundraiser in the midst of a leadership challenge . The couple arrived at the event with Malcolm Turnbull, who could be the new Prime Minister of Australia by Monday . Ms Bishop was first seen with Mr Panton at the Melbourne Cup in November but after admitting they were an item, she later turned around and denied it. The Foreign Minister said she and Mr Panton were 'just friends', trying to end suggestions that she and the businessman were in a relationship. But since then, the couple - who've been dating for about 10 months - have attended events together including the Portsea Polo near Melbourne last month. Intensely private when it comes to her personal life, Ms Bishop, who was married to Perth property developer Neil Gillon from 1983 to 1988 revealed Mr Panton is 'supportive'. But she said she doesn't include him in any of her day-to-day work, saying, 'I don’t expect other people to get involved in my job but it’s nice to have support.' After divorcing her husband in 1988 she dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years before stepping out with Mr Panton. The smiley trio appeared relaxed while the media were sent into a frenzy as they arrived together at the fundraiser . At one point, a media scrum engulfed Mr Panton and prompted Mr Turnbull to shout 'Where's David?' before reaching out to save him . Ms Bishop was first seen with Mr Panton at the Melbourne Cup in November (left) and also together at the Portsea Polo near Melbourne last month . The couple's attendance at this morning's fundraiser with Mr Turnbull comes as Mr Abbott has moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday. This was shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out a leadership challenge. Businessman David Panton was previously married to his wife Karen. Together they set up Panton Vineyard in the resort town of Shoreham just outside Melbourne, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. They had three children: Sally, Laura and Matthew. Mr Panton's two daughters accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival last year, where he made his first appearance with Julie Bishop. A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham. Mr Panton's son Matthew lives in New York. 'The last thing that Australia needs right now is instability and uncertainty,' Mr Abbott said in a brief press conference held on Sunday morning. Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them. 'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' Mr Abbott asked the Chief Government Whip, Philip Ruddock, to call a special Party Room meeting for 9am on Monday February 9 to consider the spill motion. 'It is important to end the uncertainty at the very beginning of the parliamentary sitting week,' he said. 'The normal Party Room meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning will also go ahead in the usual way.' Tony Abbott has moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday .",

        "document": "By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 14:00 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:41 EST, 27 March 2013 . A Swedish department store has sparked a fresh body image debate after pictures of its 'normal sized' mannequins appeared on social networking sites. Åhléns, the Swedish equivalent of John Lewis, introduced the new-look mannequins to all of its 76 stores back in 2010 - to widespread acclaim from customers - but a picture originally posted by blogger Rebecka Silvekroon garnered fresh interest this week after appearing on a Facebook page claiming to be shot in a H&M store. The majority of mannequins used in clothing shops, including H&M, have similar proportions to catwalk models and are usually a size 8-10, hence the huge interest in the 'real' sized models. Scroll down for video . Bigger: Åhlens say their use of larger mannequins reflects the differing sizes found among their clientele . H&M denied that the mannequins belonged to them, and the real source of the image was quickly established. but the reaction online has been immense. So popular have the maxi mannequins . proved so far, the picture has gained 'over one million likes and shares', according to Åhléns, and has generated comment from as far afield as the USA. 'Åhléns is using mannequins in different sizes because our customers, mainly women, look different,' explained Åhléns spokesman, Monica Hultgren. 'We're all proud of them because of the positive reaction [from customers] and because it's good to encourage a positive body image.' The fashion industry has come under pressure in recent years, thanks to its use of very skinny shop dummies that don't necessarily reflect the average woman. Most mannequins are around 5ft 10\" tall and a size 10. By contrast, the average British woman is a size 16 and just 5ft 4\" tall. In Sweden, the average height for a woman is 5ft 7\" and most take a size 12. Because of the disparity between the average height and size and that of a mannequin, shop dummies have become a battleground in recent years with health and women's rights charities lining up on one side and the fashion industry on the other. See the difference? A standard shop mannequin (left) and one of Åhlens' bigger ones (right) Slim: Most mannequins reflect the catwalk and are around 5ft 10\" and a size 8 or 10 . 'B-eat has long campaigned for the fashion industry to reflect the diversity of shapes and sizes of mankind and we welcome any initiative that embraces this,' says Mary George, a spokesman for eating disorders charity, B-eat. 'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of peoples' different shapes, sizes and build. Although the mannequins in the majority of Britain’s retailers’ windows are a size 10 they are generally taller than the average woman and with the addition of heels create an unrealistically long and lean image. 'These images are unachievable in the main and can provide unhelpful pressure causing women to compare their own bodies unfavourably.' 'Well done to the department store [Åhléns]', said feminist author and founder of Endangered Bodies, Susie Orbach. 'There's too much focus on one image. We all come in different sizes, shapes, colours and heights, and thank goodness for that!' Sophie Bennet, spokesman for women's rights charity, Object, added: 'Women and girls are constantly under pressure to worry about what they look like. 'Advertising, the media, music videos, video games all perpetuate the myth that, for women, to be beautiful is to be young, white or light-skinned, able-bodied and thin, pressurising women to define success by how they look rather than what they have achieved. 'This has a negative impact on women’s self esteem, promoting the idea that women are valued only on the basis of their appearance. 'The introduction of more diverse mannequins would be a positive step forward in challenging sexist representations of women and the sex object culture which promotes them.' Perhaps more pertinent, for the retailers at least, is a report in the Journal of Consumer Research, which looked into the different ways in which women respond to pictures of models. The research found that all women, barring the very underweight, reacted negatively to images of very thin women or mannequins, and their self-esteem suffers as a result. 'Our research confirms that normal females' self-esteem can shift upwards or downwards depending on the model they are exposed to,' explain authors, Dirk Smeesters, Thomas Mussweiler and Naomi Mandel. Changing times: Mannequins used to reflect women like Twiggy. Today, the 6ft tall Erin O'Connor is popular . 'Normal females (with BMIs between 18.5 and 25) have higher levels of self-esteem when exposed to moderately thin models (because they feel similar to these models) and extremely heavy models (because they feel dissimilar to these models). 'However, they have lower levels of self-esteem when exposed to moderately heavy models (because they feel similar) and extremely thin models (because they feel dissimilar).' The research, coupled with B-eat's findings, clearly show that ultra thin mannequins and models can have a negative effect on self-esteem. The big question now is whether or not the UK's shops will follow Åhléns' example. Although Debenhams has trialled size 16 mannequins - which, according to the store, were very well received - and H&M has said it isn't against the idea, hinting at the possibility of using them in future, it remains to be seen whether any others will follow.",

There's a side of potatoes and you finish it off with a scoop of ice cream. Here's the twist -- this all comes with a generous helping of dirt. Not normal, backyard variety dirt, special nutrient-rich soil. The unique tasting menu is the creation of Toshio Tanabe, a former gymnast and boxer turned culinary inventor. Tanabe says the dirt menu was a logical addition for his quaint restaurant, Ne Quittez Pas, which is located in Tokyo's Gotanda neighborhood. \"This is a seafood restaurant, so we have the flavors from the ocean,\" he says. \"I was also looking for flavors from the earth.\" The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . But this is not the typical dirt you'd find it your backyard. It comes from a garden wholesaler, which provides the high quality soil, taken deep beneath the earth's surface -- 10 meters down, in fact. Germaphobes can take some comfort, perhaps. Tanabe tells us the soil is first lab tested, and then heated to extreme temperatures, to kill off any bacteria. After that process is complete Tanabe will work it into his menu. This special fare is certainly not dirt cheap. The set course is about US$110 per person. And how does it taste? According to one adventurous eater, who wished to remain anonymous the night of our visit, \"I didn't think it would be real dirt. I was a bit nervous. But it was a subtle taste.\" When we ask Tanabe, about his next key ingredient, he shrugs and says he's not sure. \"This idea came about naturally.\" Whether diners dig into the dirt or not, it does take the idea of organic to a whole new level.

A road safety campaigner is being quizzed on suspicion of attempted murder after his car was driven into his family home with his estranged wife and three children inside. Andrew McGarry was arrested after claims the Vauxhall Zafira may have been deliberately rammed through the front wall of the property. The 37-year-old architect is believed to have got out of the blue vehicle before it caught fire. Scene of investigation: The car was driven into the family home and exploded - no-one inside the property was hurt . Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame. At the time of the 7am incident McGarry’s estranged wife Heather, 27, and three children believed to be two boys and a girl aged between two and six were inside the £100,000 house. They all escaped uninjured. Wrecked: Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame . Today Greater Manchester Police said the suspect who was arrested near the scene of the crash was being held at a police station after also escaping injury. They are investigating whether the car was driven at the house deliberately and then set on fire afterwards - or whether the vehicle caught fire as a result of the impact. An officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire. The remains of the front wall were piled up in front of the lounge window which had been shattered by the force of the impact. One neighbour said: 'It was about 7am when I heard a loud bang and I went out to see what happened from my front door. I could see the car had collided with the wall and there was smoke and flames everywhere. Crime scene: An officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire . 'The next thing we knew was there were police everywhere and a police helicopter flying around. If one of those kiddies had been in the front room we could have been looking at a fatality.' Another neighbour said: 'There was a large bang and I came out and saw flames coming out of the front window. Quite a few people came out too. 'I only moved here in November last year and knew that a woman lived there with three kids and partner. They must have only recently split up because i thought I’d seen them together. 'I’d never heard anything untowards coming from the house or an shouting or disturbances. The children are all very small, I think two are a nursery and one at primary school.' A police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 7.05am on Tuesday 24 July 2012, police were called to Victoria Road in Horwich following a report that a car had collided with the front of a house. 'Police officers and firefighters attended and found that a Vauxhall Zafira had collided with the house and was on fire. 'Three children and a woman were inside the house at the time of the incident but were not injured. A joint investigation is being carried out by police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service to look into the circumstances surrounding the fire.' 'A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken into police custody for questioning.' Roads were closed temporarily whilst forensic officers examined the scene. The incident occurred after McGarry who runs his own design and architect practice campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter Lacey - then aged two years old - was knocked down by a car outside their home in September 2010. She survived the impact and made a full recovery but Mr McGarry collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area. As a result mobile speed checks were carried out on the busy road last year. In an interview with his local paper McGarry said: 'I get really emotional when I talk about what happened to Lacey, and I am just so glad she is still here. 'I want to thank everyone who is supporting me. The roads will be a lot safer if people are reminded about the 30mph speed limit and how to spot it. 'On roads that have a lot of pedestrians and houses on each side, children can just run out into the road like my daughter did. 'If the driver is doing more than 30 mph, it can be difficult for them to stop and there can be a serious accident.' McGarry set up Facebook and Twitter pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages instead about his work designing loft and garage conversions.

        "document": "(CNN) -- Sean Sasser, whose relationship with the late Pedro Zamora on MTV's \"The Real World: San Francisco\" broke cultural barriers on U.S. television, has died, his longtime partner told CNN on Thursday. Sasser was 44. Sasser, who had been HIV positive for 25 years, died Wednesday from mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that was diagnosed just last month, Michael Kaplan said. He died in the Washington home he shared with Kaplan. Sasser was not one of the original cast members but became a household name as his relationship with Zamora was explored during the show's third season in 1994. The couple's exchange of vows during a commitment ceremony, the first ever broadcast on U.S. television, became a landmark moment in TV history. The couple began dating during the taping of the series. Their relationship and Zamora's battle with AIDS while living in \"The Real World\" house with seven strangers became must-see-TV for teens and young adults, many of whom had never been exposed to a gay couple, much less someone living with HIV. Zamora, who had been diagnosed with AIDS at age 17, was a well-known AIDS activist at the time he was cast on the show at age 21. Sasser, who was also working as an activist and educator, also revealed on the show that he was HIV positive. During the taping of the series, Zamora's health took a turn. \"This wasn't a romantic death. It wasn't a heroic death. It was horrible, and Sean couldn't do anything except watch it happen,\" fellow co-star Judd Winick told the online magazine POZ in 1997. Winick chronicled his friendship with Zamora and Sasser in the graphic novel \"Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss and What I Learned.\" Zamora died on Nov. 11, 1994, with Sasser at his side just hours after the airing of the final episode of the season, which featured the two men exchanging their vows, according to MTV. Sasser continued his work as an AIDS activist and educator. Sasser recently moved from Portland, Oregon, to Washington when Kaplan took a job with AIDS United, a non-profit group. The couple had dated off and on for years since the 1990s, but moved in together about six years ago, Kaplan said. Sasser was a pastry chef at RIS, a Washington restaurant, but he was unable to work for the last five weeks, Kaplan said. His last week was spent in bed at home, his partner said. His illness evolved quickly, with the July diagnosis of stage 4 mesothelioma following a June blood test showing an abnormality, Kaplan said. News of Sasser's death spread quickly across social media, with Winick posting a series of photos of Sasser and Zamora via Twitter. Actor and gay rights activist Wilson Cruz wrote on Twitter: \"My heart breaks. Another beacon of light in our community is darkened tonight with the passing of Sean Sasser.\" \"It is because of Pedro and Sean that I made safe decisions about protection and partners in 1993 at just 15. Thanks,\" Yasemin Abdulraouf wrote in a post on Twitter. Another person, identified by the Twitter handle Hollis, wrote: \"U & Pedro showed true grace & dignity in the face of adversity. Hope u have found peace.\" MTV wrote, simply: \"RIP to a member of the MTV family, groundbreaking Real World star + AIDS activist.\" People we lost in 2013 .

The conventional wisdom is wrong. On Wednesday, something important is happening in Washington. On that day, a bipartisan group featuring dozens of members of Congress, state and local leaders and business, citizen and community leaders is gathering at the No Labels National Ideas Meeting to kick off a yearlong process to set a path for where America needs to go and how we get there. This isn't the type of gathering you'd expect six weeks out from an election. These days, members of the two parties barely talk, let alone work with one another. To crib an old Bill Murray line from \"Ghostbusters\": the sight of Democrats and Republicans actually meeting together may cause mass hysteria. The subject of debate will be No Labels' National Strategic Agenda, which sets a framework for action on four goals chosen with input from a nationwide survey that No Labels conducted last fall: Create 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years; balance the federal budget by 2030; secure Medicare and Social Security for the next 75 years; and make America energy-secure by 2024. The process to create No Labels' National Strategic Agenda has been endorsed by over 80 members of Congress, and it's coming together with an entirely original approach. This is not just another policy plan. In fact, at this point, the National Strategic Agenda isn't a policy plan at all, because its details will be filled in over the next year -- with input from people across America. This agenda will be developed in a step-by-step fashion that solves problems the way they should be solved. The way we tried to solve problems when we served as the governors of Utah and West Virginia. At the National Ideas Meeting, participants will join working groups (with a member of Congress in each group) to focus on one of the four signature goals, progress to agreement on the fundamental facts, and conclude by agreeing on broad policy principles that can inform the creation of specific policy and legislative solutions. Subsequent meetings in New Hampshire, Iowa and elsewhere will take a similar approach. The effort will culminate on October 5, 2015, when the fully formed National Strategic Agenda will be unveiled in New Hampshire and Iowa. No Labels will work to inject the agenda into the emerging presidential debate by activating our network of citizens, members of Congress, and state and local leaders. The ultimate aim of this exercise is for the next president and the next Congress to use the National Strategic Agenda as a basis for bipartisan action. Like everything No Labels has proposed since its launch in December 2010, the National Strategic Agenda will be a product of discussion and agreement from every part of the political spectrum. We don't for a moment underestimate how hard it will be for a future Congress and president to coalesce around even one of these goals. But difficulty is no excuse for inaction. For too long, Washington has been a place defined by all tactics, and no strategy. We spend all our time focused on winning the day, the week or the next election, and in the process, we've lost sight of doing what's necessary for America to win the future. With the National Strategic Agenda, No Labels is bringing a unity of purpose that has been missing in our government. We're not just identifying what needs to be done. We've developed a rigorous process for how it gets done. To the many millions of Americans who are wondering what, if anything, they can do to fix the dysfunction in our government, this is your chance to get involved. These National Strategic Agenda meetings could be coming to a town near you, and you can help determine what is in the final plan. If you can't make a meeting, you can still work to ensure that candidates and members of Congress endorse the National Strategic Agenda. This is no time to let frustration with the political process lead you to tune out. Because America is facing a fork in the road. We can continue the partisan fighting and failures of the last decade. Or we can choose a different path. Our leaders can come together around a shared vision to deliver good jobs, a balanced budget, peace of mind for our seniors and energy security. We've done it before. We can do it again.",

        "document": "Ronnie O'Sullivan started his UK Championship campaign against Daniel Wells on one leg but will withdraw from the tournament if he feels no let-up from his broken ankle by the weekend. The Rocket beat plucky amateur Daniel Wells 6-2 at York's Barbican Centre, coming through after a tricky first half of the match. It has often been said that the five-time world champion could win a snooker match with all manner of handicaps enforced, and playing on a broken left ankle after a fall while running backs that up. Ronnie O'Sullivan was clearly in during his first round match at the UK Championship . But for all the admirable courage shown, O'Sullivan admitted afterwards he will not start Sunday's second-round match against Leeds veteran Peter Lines or Northern Ireland's Joe Swail if he has felt no improvements. 'The injury is disappointing, a broken ankle. It is not too comfortable and I didn't enjoy any of that,' the 38-year-old said at his post-match press conference. 'I thought I would give it a go but if it doesn't improve I'm not sure I'm going to play my next match. 'I can't get on the shot properly, I'm hobbling around, it's swelling up and it's painful. 'I've taken all the painkillers, done all I can do, and if it's not better by Sunday I probably won't play.' The Rocket beat plucky amateur Daniel Wells 6-2 at York's Barbican Centre on Thursday . A withdrawal from the sport's most popular player would be a severe blow for the tournament but would, even at such an early stage, open the field up. O'Sullivan has looked near-unbeatable since his return to the main tour after a self-imposed year-long exile, and he was a short-priced favourite to win a fifth UK title. The Essex man has cited running as one of the key reasons why he has finally beaten the mental troubles that plagued his career. He revealed in his recent autobiography, entitled 'Running', that he had contemplated quitting snooker all together and dedicating himself to athletics. Now, though, he says he is going to put the trainers away until he retires. 'I am absolutely gutted. I am enjoying my snooker more than ever and to do that through running - I am really angry with myself,' he said. 'I am so annoyed at myself. I think I will probably stop running now until the end of my snooker career because you can't do this. O'Sullivan gets on a shot against Wells but broken ankle could force him to pull out of tournament . O'Sullivan tweeted picture of his broken left ankle on Tuesday . 'It's the third time I have broken my foot. I fell over in the forest. I was running with my mate and he'd asked me what time I was doing on the run. I looked at my watch and I just lost my footing and I slipped. 'That was it. Partly his fault, partly my fault and I am frustrated with myself because I am a snooker player, not a runner. I just shouldn't do it. It is really frustrating.' O'Sullivan was not the only walking wounded at York, with two-time world champion Mark Williams beating Steven Hallworth 6-1 despite a muscle injury picked up during weight training. Jack Lisowski also won by that scoreline against Chris Melling. Elsewhere, 1997 world winner Ken Doherty beat Mitchell Mann, Marco Fu avoided a shock loss to Ahmed Saif while Mark Davis, Liam Highfield, Luca Brecel, Robin Hull and Jimmy Robertson also progressed. In Thursday’s evening session, defending champion Neil Robertson waltzed through 6-0 against Joe O'Connor, while Stephen Maguire beat Lu Ning 6-2. Oli Lines failed to follow his father Peter into the next round after succumbing 6-2 to Yu Delu, while 2008 champion Shaun Murphy beat veteran James Wattana 6-3.",

        "document": "By . Mark Duell, Lydia Warren and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 11:59 PM on 4th January 2012 . The mother of the suspected LA arsonist is facing deportation over claims she failed to pay for a breast enlargement operation in her native Germany. Harry Burkhart, 24, was arrested on suspicion of starting more than 50 fires in the Hollywood area and has now been charged with dozens of counts of arson. He is suspected to have started his arson spree after seeing his mother dragged off by State Department officials. Yesterday his mother Dorothee Burkhart, who is in her 50s, appeared in court charged with 19 counts of fraud in Frankfurt, some of them allegedly carried out 'as a member of gang'. She claimed her son was 'mentally ill', and produced a letter from a Canadian doctor which appeared to support this, suggesting that he is autistic and suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Burkhart is currently on suicide watch in police custody. It emerged today that he is suspected of being responsible for a fire at a house in Germany owned by his family. Detained: Harry Burkhart, left, has been arrested at a time when his mother Dorothee faces deportation. The picture on the right was posted on an advert linked to a phone number believed to belong to her . Taken in: The suspect's arrest was a measure of relief to anxious residents who had grown fearful after several nights of seemingly random blazes . Los Angeles county sheriff's department detain a man they described as a 'person of interest', in West Hollywood, January 2, 2012. Online: This picture comes from an advert for an erotic masseuse, also linked to Mrs Burkhart . Ad: This page links to a website believed to be registered to Ms Burkhart . Ms Burkhart appears to own an erotic . massage business, and has been linked to websites offering the services . of 'Goddess Annabelle' in the Hollywood area. The sites describe their owner as a 'sexologist', but emphasise that her massages are not to be confused with prostitution. The potential deportation of Ms . Burkhart, who is said not to have a valid visa, is thought to be . connected to her pony-tailed son's alleged rampage through Los Angeles. In a brief court appearance, where . she was accused of crimes including avoiding payment for her breast . augmentation surgery, she appeared perplexed, wondering aloud if her son . was dead. 'Where is my son? What did you do to my son?' she asked the judge. Harry Burkhart was being held without bail after being arrested in the arson case on Monday. According to a police officer, Mr Burkhart erupted into an anti-American rant at a recent immigration hearing for his mother. More: Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters extinguish cars on fire in a carport in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles earlier this week as the spate of arson attacks reached its fifth night . Attacks: The arsonist set 12 new fires early on Monday morning, in North Hollywood, California . Outside his Hollywood apartment, some . neighbours described him as a loner who loitered around the busy . commercial strip at night and could be heard arguing with his mother. But Shlomo Elady, a hair stylist who . regularly trimmed Burkhart's long hair, recalled someone who spoke three . languages, dreamed of visiting Jerusalem and cared for a sickly mother . who had trouble walking. Mr Elady said he was stunned that the . man who lived with his mother above his Sunset Boulevard shop is . suspected of torching vehicles, some just steps from his home. The fires . caused an estimated $3million in damage. 'He loved his mom, the way every son loves his mom,' Mr Elady said. 'He's not a creepy guy.' Mr Burkhart was described by Los . Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca as ‘the most dangerous arsonist’ he . could remember in the area, after more than 50 fires caused $3million in . damage. The arson . attacks destroyed parked cars and scorched buildings across Hollywood, . West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. Since the arrest firemen . have not attended any more suspicious fires. Burnt out: The onslaught of fires left residents on edge over the weekend in some of the city's most densely populated areas . Destroyed: One of dozens of cars damaged by the Hollywood arsonist over the last few days . After the blazes: The 50-plus fires have also damaged buildings around the wealthy neighbourhood . Battle: Firefighters try to put out an apartment fire that started from one of the 12 new carport fires set by an arsonist early Monday morning . ‘Our long four-day nightmare is . over,’ Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said, after the . suspect was arrested for investigation of arson of an inhabited dwelling . and held on $250,000 bail. Burkhart, of Frankfurt, Germany, was . pulled over by a reserve sheriff's deputy who works for $1 a year - . although the investigation is ongoing and authorities haven't ruled out . others being involved. 'Our long four-day nightmare is over' Zev Yaroslavsky . Police . searched a Sunset Boulevard apartment located above a hair salon and . optician's on Monday night where Burkhart is believed to have lived for . more than a year, reported the Los Angeles Times. The . arrest was a measure of relief to anxious residents who had grown . fearful after several nights of seemingly random blazes. Police have not . released any motive. He is due in court on Wednesday. Galina Illarionova, who lives in the . same apartment complex as the suspect, told reporters that an agitated . Burkhart visited her on Sunday and said his mother was in trouble with . authorities. Advice: Firefighters and police are urging residents to check their cars and ensure they keep parking lots secure . Attacks: The fires have been started in several areas of Los Angeles over the last five days . Surveillance: Police say the person of interest (right) is a white male between 20 and 30 years old with a receding hairline and a shoulder-length ponytail . ‘We are very confident in this . arrest, but we have a long way to go,’ said Police Chief Charlie Beck . Authorities do not know how long he has been in the U.S. and said he . isn't cooperating with them. One . of Sheriff Baca's reserve deputies, Shervin Lalezary, pulled over . Burkhart's van sought by arson investigators shortly after 3am. Mr . Lalezary works as a lawyer and said he was glad he helped out. ‘I'm . ecstatic that law enforcement gets to shine a little bit,’ Mr Lalezary . said. Burkhart reportedly told authorities 'I hate America' as he was . arrested, according to ABC News. 'I'm ecstatic that law enforcement gets to shine a little bit' Shervin Lalezary . Rick Savage, who was there when a man . believed to be Burkhart was arrested, said witnesses gave him the . middle finger when he was sitting in the back of the squad car, and he . smiled in response. The . onslaught of fires left residents on edge over the weekend in some of . the city’s most densely populated areas. Hundreds of investigators, . police officers and firemen dealt with the blazes. Police conducted extra patrols all weekend, and the noise of helicopters and sirens persisted virtually nonstop in Hollywood. The . blazes forced many apartment dwellers from their homes. But there were . no serious injuries - one fireman was hurt in a fall from a ladder, and . another person suffered smoke inhalation. Locations: A map displayed at a press conference on Monday shows the locations of dozens of arson fires that were set over the weekend in Los Angeles, California . Response: The fires started shortly after midnight and occurred over a four-hour span before dawn . Feeling the heat: A firefighter battles flames in Hollywood, California, after another night of blazes . One of Saturday's fires was at the . Hollywood and Highland entertainment complex, a popular tourist spot . bordered by the Walk of Fame in a neighbourhood including Grauman's . Chinese Theatre. Shervin Lalezary,  a reserve sheriff's deputy who works for $1 a year, was billed as a 'true hero' by Sheriff Baca. The Beverly Hills real estate lawyer spotted Burkhart's Dodge Caravan in the early hours of Monday morning. He qualified to ride a patrol car solo last month and had back-up from LAPD officers when he went up to the van. One of . the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim . Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27. It was listed for . nearly $1.2million earlier this year. He . used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s . and it was the inspiration for the Doors' song ‘Love Street’. Despite . the arrest, authorities continued to urge vigilance. ‘We're . not resting, and we're not stopping’ the extra patrols, Police . Commander Andrew Smith said on Monday. ’If you have lights in your carport area, . keep them on tonight.’ Other deliberate fires were reported in Hollywood on Thursday and . two people were arrested. But police said that those suspects were not . connected with the 52 other blazes.",

A father and son who were filmed laughing as they encouraged their dogs to tear animals to shreds will be released from prison in just a few weeks after being given light sentences today. Ronald Guy, 63, and his son Lee, 42, both from Birkenhead in Merseyside, were branded 'absolutely inhumane' after filming themselves feeding live pigeons to ferrets, cutting off the heads of chickens with knives and setting a pack of dogs on a fox. But the the pair were today jailed for just 12 and 22 weeks respectively after admitting a total of seven animal cruelty offences at Wirral Magistrates' Court. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Cruel: Ronald Guy (right) and his son Lee (left) were branded 'absolutely inhumane' after filming themselves cutting off the heads of chickens with knives (pictured) Attack: The two men were heard laughing as they encouraged their three dogs to attack wild rats . Lee Guy was jailed for 22 weeks after he used a mobile phone to film himself feeding wild pigeons to ferrets and setting up a fight between three dogs and a fox. His father Ronald Guy, 63, was jailed for . 12 weeks after causing unnecessary suffering to animals through the . ‘inhumane’ slaughter of chickens. At an earlier hearing in February, . Lee Guy pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including the inhumane . slaughter of chickens, causing wild rats to be attacked by dogs and . taking feral pigeons to feed ferrets. He also pleaded guilty to causing an animal fight by placing a fox with three dogs. Ronald Guy had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of the inappropriate slaughter of chickens. Trapped: Lee Guy is pictured holding a cage containing a wild rat he captured. Lee and his father Ronald would later set the rat loose in a courtyard and encourage their dogs to tear it to pieces . Hunt: The captured rats were released from their cages into a rundown courtyard, where Lee Guy and his father Ronald would then set their dogs on them . Sick: On a video released by the RSPCA, the three dogs can be seen chasing the terrified rat before pinning it in a corner and tearing it to pieces . Referring to Lee Guy’s role in the . acts, Chris Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'The charges involve the . slaughter of chickens, and the causing of wild rats to be attacked by . dogs. 'There are three offences relating to the rats and there’s also an offence relating to the feeding of wild pigeons to ferrets. 'And . an offence - perhaps the most serious - of causing the animal fight to . take place between a fox and three dogs. The dogs were set upon the fox . that was kept in a caged box, tearing it apart and killing it.' Several . of the offences - which took place between November 2011 and June 2013 - . took place in front of gathered crowds and were captured on video. Lee Guy could even be heard laughing on the footage. Pain: The dogs eventually get hold of the rat as it tries to escape down a drain. They then tear it apart . No escape: Elsewhere in the footage, the dogs are seen being encouraged to enter a small cage in which a fox is held. The dogs can then be seen viciously attacking the animal . John Ballam, defending, said both defendants were ‘very ashamed’ by their actions. He . added Ronald Guy had enjoyed success at dog shows with pets in the past . and that the prospect of being banned from owning animals would be a . 'considerable punishment' to him. But District Judge Michael Ableson ignored pleas to give the defendants suspended sentences. 'This was absolutely inhumane behaviour to treat animals in this way,' he said. 'Most people would not be able to comprehend how you could treat animals with such cruelty.' RSPCA officer Anthony Joynes described the case as the worst one of its kind he had ever dealt with and welcomed the sentences. Vicious: The fox is quickly torn to pieces by the dogs, as one of the two men is heard encouraging them to increase their aggression . Death: The fox eventually escapes from the cage, but the dogs follow it to a grassy area, where it is torn apart . 'These sort of offences are just barbaric. It is abhorrent cruelty that belongs in the history books,' he said. 'There has been a rise in this sort of behaviour across the North West and if people are going to take that decision to get involved in that sort of cruelty then they can expect to spend time in prison,' he added. 'Lee Guy is clearly obsessed with the interaction between predator and prey, even to the point that I could hear laughter in the background,' Mr Joynes went on to say. The defendants were also ordered to pay £300 each in court costs. Their four dogs, one of which has since given birth to six puppies, have also been seized.",

        "document": "(CNN)The chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph has quit after describing the British newspaper's lack of coverage of the HSBC tax-dodging scandal as a \"fraud on its readers.\" Peter Oborne, who had been at the London-based broadsheet since 2010, accused its executives of placing the interests of the bank -- a key advertiser -- above its duty to bring the story to its readers. He lamented the sharp fall in circulation and the arrival of a \"click culture\" at the newspaper, which meant stories were no longer judged by their importance, accuracy or appeal to those who actually bought it. \"With the collapse in standards has come a most sinister development,\" Oborne wrote Tuesday, in a rambling commentary published on opendemocracy.net. \"It has long been axiomatic in quality British journalism that the advertising department and editorial should be kept rigorously apart. There is a great deal of evidence that, at the Telegraph, this distinction has collapsed.\" He was referring to the recent \"HSBC files\" case, where documents leaked to French authorities by a former HSBC employee, and then analyzed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) accused the banking giant of using a secretive Swiss banking system to conceal the identities of account holders, and in many cases, help them avoid paying tax. Oborne pointed out that while the story was splashed across the front pages of its competitors for days, \"you needed a microscope to find the Telegraph coverage.\" \"Nothing on Monday, six slim paragraphs at the bottom left of page two on Tuesday, seven paragraphs deep in the business pages on Wednesday,\" he wrote. \"The Telegraph's reporting only looked up when the story turned into claims that there might be questions about the tax affairs of people connected to the Labour party.\" The Telegraph is a politically conservative title, largely supportive of Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party. Shortly after Oborne's blistering attack, the newspaper hit back. \"It is a matter of huge regret that Peter Oborne, for nearly five years a contributor to the Telegraph, should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo, on his own paper.\" An HSBC spokesperson declined to comment on Oborne's claims when contacted by CNN Wednesday. Oborne said this isn't the first time the newspaper had suppressed stories relating to HSBC. Last year, he recalled working on a piece about how prominent British Muslims had received letters out of the blue from HSBC informing them that their accounts had been closed. \"No reason was given, and it was made plain that there was no possibility of appeal,\" he wrote. When he tried to publish the story, he described being \"fobbed off\" and given non-existent legal issues as an excuse. \"When I pushed the point, an executive took me aside and said that 'there is a bit of an issue' with HSBC. Eventually I gave up in despair and offered the article to openDemocracy,\" he wrote. Oborne said the reporting on HSBC is part of a wider problem at the newspaper. He described the Telegraph's stance on last year's pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as \"bizarre.\" When rivals including The Guardian and The Times wrote in December about the refusal by the Chinese government to allow a committee of British lawmakers into the former UK colony, he said the Telegraph remained silent. In September that year, the newspaper published a commentary by the Chinese ambassador to Britain to coincide with what Oborne described as its \"lucrative\" China Watch supplement. It was given the headline \"Let's not allow Hong Kong to come between us.\" When he expressed his concern about the direction the paper was taking, Oborne recalled a meeting with Murdoch MacLennan, the chief executive of the Telegraph Media Group. \"I told him that I was not leaving to join another paper. I was resigning as a matter of conscience. \"Mr. MacLennan agreed that advertising was allowed to affect editorial, but was unapologetic, saying that 'it was not as bad as all that' and adding that there was a long history of this sort of thing at the Telegraph,\" wrote Oborne.",

Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara have opted to stay away from other people to protect Mr O'Neill's daughter Eliza, four, who has the rare metabolism disorder, Sanfilippo syndrome. Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Glenn and Cara O'Neill with their children, Eliza, four, and Beckham, seven, have been in self-quarantine for 160 days in order to protect Eliza who has a rear metabolic condition from getting any worse . In May Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Ms O'Neil left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Mr Neill now works from home as a purchasing consultant. Mr O'Neill told the New York Daily News: 'People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?' The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They leave their house a week, but only to places they know will be empty, like a deserted beach. States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies mandating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines. Medical experts have said the regulations are unnecessary and many people placed under the mandates have resisted them. Eliza has Sanfilippo syndrome; children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads . Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox was placed in a tent outside a New Jersey hospital with no shower, no TV and only a portable toilet after returning from Sierra Leone on Friday, The New York Post reported. She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday. She was then allowed to return to her home in Maine where she served her 21-day quarantine. The only time Mr O'Neill has gone somewhere where there were other people, was a bank, to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation -  and it almost went horribly wrong. The 42-year-old informed the bank ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything. But after pulling on a protective mask and gloves while in the car park, a fellow motorist quickly retreated, 'he thought I was going to rob the place'. Mr O'Neil then called the bank and reminded them of his circumstances before entering. Despite testing negative for Ebola, Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox, who had just returned from Sierra Leone, was placed in a tent outside a New Jersey hospital and kept there for several days; she was later allowed to return home to serve a 21-day quarantine . The family leaves the house once a week, but only to spots where they know other people won't be . Eliza, who is soon to turn five, is at a critical stage. A simple cold or illness could accelerate her deterioration, and keeping her away from people has paid off. Mr O'Neill said she has not gotten sick and is doing as well as can be expected. The family is raising money to fund a clinical trial that will hopefully cure the disease. They will remain under quarantine under the procedure is available, which the hope is early next year. The family are raising money to fund a clinical trial that will hopefully cure Eliza's disease . Ms O'Neill said her and her husband appreciate the time they spend with their children, but conceded living under the conditions wasn't easy.  The family don't have a TV and spend a limited amount of time using computers. She said: 'We're OK. We do what we can do. Sometimes we get overwhelmed, but it's just life. We have bad moments and good ones.' The family doesn't get visitors, but they will Skype their relatives and Eliza's speech therapist.",

A man is fighting for his life after crashing his Audi TT into a house in the early hours of this morning. The male driver, believed to be in his twenties, embedded the red sports car into the side of the house in Lowestoft, Suffolk, at 1.45am after coming off the road and crashing through a fence. He was taken to the James Paget Hospital with serious head injuries but was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he was in a 'critical condition', said Suffolk Police today.

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . She was spotted in London on Thursday with a pram that cost a staggering £1,450. But, within 24 hours, Tamara Ecclestone has ventured out into the capital with her baby daughter Sophia pushing a second pram, a Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, in as many days. Just like her cars, it seems just one ride isn't enough. Here we go again: Tamara Ecclestone seen pushing her other pram, a . Bugaboo Cameleon3, £819, on a stroll with pampered princess Sophia . Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue . fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked . through Kensington Palace Gardens . The heiress - who is married to Jay . Rutland - made her public debut with their little girl on Wednesday but . obviously doesn't want her pride and joy to be seen in anything but the best. Bugaboo is the popular choice for new parents, but while it may be significantly cheaper than her blingtastic Silver Cross, it is still a premium choice, with the cheaper models starting from over £400. Wearing a pair of leggings and a blue fleeced top, the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked through Kensington Palace Gardens. Matching her look with a pair of blue and white trainers, she has clearly snapped back into shape after giving birth less than one month ago. But onlookers will question Tamara's need for a secondary pram given how indulgent her other one iswith Swarovski . crystals. The daughter of Bernie Ecclestone displayed a more modest baby stroller when she was spotted out on Friday . Mother's nature: The brunette beauty has clearly taken to motherhood well . While it is not clear just how much . pram's customisation cost, just the Silver Cross - the iconic Balmoral . pram - itself costs a staggering £1,450. And . while there are several companies in the UK who offer the . customisation, it wouldn't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the . pram changed to her liking. However, Tamara didn't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister Petra. Only the best! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland stepped out with daughter Sophia in a customised, crystal-encrusted pink Silver Cross pram in London on Wednesday . Doting: Tamara and Jay looked like the picture of parental bliss as they strolled along with Sophia in the sunshine . Personalised: . The pram also had the name 'Sophia' in a name plate on the front - in . case there is any doubt over who it belongs to . Bling: The pram itself, the Balmoral, costs £1,450 - while the customisation would have been more - including the baby's 'Sophia' nameplate would have been more . Fit for an Ecclestone princess: Sophia is riding in style in her blingtastic baby carriage . The Balmoral pram has been popular among celebrities for years, with stars including Lily Allen splashing out on the designs for their children. It not only looks good but boasts a hand-sprung chassis, is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels. The transport also includes a lever operated brake system, a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket. While the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram, it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that Tamara would have had to pay extra for. The pram also features a silver nameplate which read 'Sophia' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to. Despite only giving birth to Sophia on 17th March, Tamara already appeared to have snapped back into shape. Are you ok in there? Tamara and Jay couldn't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll . In 1877, inventor William Wilson created Silver Cross because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children. He opened a small workshop in Silver Cross Street, Leeds, where he grew the business with the help of his three sons. In 1913, it became the official royal pram, and a special edition was created and sent to George VI for Princess Elizabeth, who is now Queen. After moving to larger premises, an old silk factory in Guiseley, it has grown to a worldwide brand, with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries. Tamara's Balmoral pram from the Vintage Collection costs £1,450. The Kensington style starts at £950. The 29-year-old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three-quarter length black leggings and pink Nike trainers for the outing on Tuesday. With her make-up and hair completely flawless, it's hard to believe that Tamara is a first time mother. Speaking to Hello! magazine recently about parenthood, Tamara said: 'Motherhood is the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm enjoying every minute of it. 'I knew I would love it - I just didn't know how much. I feel born to be a mother. 'Although I've always wanted children, . I've never felt that intensely before. But Sophia has turned my world . upside down in an amazing way and I've never been happier. 'Having my own . family with Jay is just perfect.' How did she do that? Tamara already appears to have snapped back into shape, less than three weeks after the birth of her daughter . Proud family: Tamara looked flawless in Sophia's first picture just minutes after her daughter's birth . Jay looked equally relaxed for the jaunt, keeping a protective arm around his wife's waist as they walked along. Within hours of welcoming Sophia into . the world, Tamara and Jay announced the birth of their first child by . uploading an intimate shot of mother and baby onto the former reality . star's Instagram page. She . wrote alongside the immaculate snap: 'Welcome to the world Sophia, our . beautiful baby girl, born yesterday 6lb 9oz. Proudest day of our lives, . never felt love like this.

        "document": "Angry at her Nascar rival for apparently spinning her off the track for a second time in two days, Danica Patrick certainly let Denny Hamlin know about it when she confronted him after a qualifying race. The pair were involved in a heated argument in which she accused the Joe Gibbs Racing driver of spinning her off the track during the 150 mile race before Sunday's Daytona 500. Patrick needed to finish 15th or better to guarantee a spot  and managed to come in 10th despite the setback. A furious Danica Patrick (right) calls out Denny Hamlin after the pair had a coming together during the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Budweiser Duel 2 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida . Patrick, in car 10, span off track after being sent sideways by the incident with Hamlin seconds before . She was not happy with her fellow driver, telling him straight 'you got on my left rear and spun me out' Hamlin eventually clasped his head in his hands as Patrick refused to accept his explanation for the spin . But she wasn't about to let Hamlin of the hook as, with cameras rolling, she marches over to Hamlin, grasps him by his race suit and makes her feelings clear in front of dozens of closely packed onlookers post race on Thursday. The two had already been involved in an incident in practice the day before where Patrick accused Hamlin of the very same thing. In yesterday's confrontation over the dangerous high speed smash, she berated him furiously, saying: 'What are you doing, seriously? You did the same thing in practice. 'You get on my left rear and it spins me out. 'Don't be up my a** on my left corner again.' Hamlin replied: 'Nobody has your back like I do but I can't give you an extra two feet because it's you.' The heated argument continued, with Hamlin try to calm Patrick, who stares him out intensely while he makes his case. He holds out his hands in a conciliatory gesture and grasps Patrick round the shoulders at times, but there is no placating her and Hamlin finally seems exasperated and covers his face with his hands. Hamlin tried to tell Patrick the problem was with her car's aerodynamics but sh was having none of it . The spin left Patrick fighting to finish high enough to qualify for the 500, but she still managed to do so . Patrick told Hamlin: 'You did the same thing, nobody else left me with a problem out there' 'He cut across my rear bumper and pulls the back end around,' Patrick said. 'I don't want to have these issues, but if we're going to have these issues then we're going to have to deal with them. 'We can't be putting ourselves out of our race at someone else's expense and nothing's happened to him.' Tony Stewart, her team co-owner, entered the fray and instructed Hamlin to watch the video. 'What do you want me to do Tony, not race close?' replied Hamlin, adamant that Patrick's car was too loose and he didn't make contact. He maintained the spin was caused by aerodynamics, not contact. 'I try to treat everyone as equal,' Hamlin said. 'If you're in this Cup series, you deserved your way here and you can handle a lot of situations. 'I just got close to her and her car got loose again. I just tried to explain that, \"Danica, oh, it's you, I've got to stay away two feet because your car is loose?\" 'I guess I just have to give more room because once I get close enough to her, her car just gets out of control.' After the crash Patrick's Stewart-Haas Racing team worked frantically on rapid repairs and she restarted 18th with two laps to go. She was pushed all the way around Daytona International Speedway by teammate Kurt Busch to finish high enough to make the main event on Sunday.",

        "document": "By . Naomi Greenaway . A family are still desperately searching for a missing mum  after she vanished during a shopping trip near her home in Collinstown, West Dublin, three years ago. Esra Uryun was 38 years old when she disappeared leaving behind her husband of seven years, Ozgur, her then two-year-old son Emin, now five, and her older sister, Berna Fidan. ‘Has someone got hold of her? Has something horrible happened to her? It just doesn't make sense,’ Berna says fighting back tears on tonight’s Channel Four documentary, The Missing. Scroll down for video . Berna Fidan, sister of missing mum Esra Uryun, whom she's searched tirelessly for since her disappearance three years ago . The harrowing programme delves into the mystery of the 2,000 missing people who vanish without a trace in Britain each year. ‘She wouldn't just run off on her own. That child was everything to her. I don't believe she would have taken off and left her baby behind,’ says Berna as the documentary airs touching home video footage of a doting mother kissing her little boy and saying, ‘I love you’. Esra's distraught family is unable to . continue normal life and unable to grieve, but live in hope that they . will one day be reunited. Esra Uryun, 38, has not been seen since leaving her home at Collinstown in a silver Renault three years ago . After Esra’s disappearance, her husband and son moved to London and in a heart-wrenching moment little Emin talks about the mother he hardly remembers. 'She went to the shops by herself. She didn't know the way home, then she got lost somewhere,' he says as he plays at home with his father. Ozgur tries to describe how hard it’s been for his son, ‘I can't understand what's going on. Think about his little brain -- how he's trying to cope with the situation.’ Turning to his own experience he says, ‘You’re always fighting between your heart and your mind. Your heart is saying she's coming back but your logic is saying the probability is getting low.’ An hour after Esra left for the shops that fateful morning, her silver Renault was clocked on CCTV footage in the nearby town of Bray. Since her disappearance Berna has gone to extraordinary . lengths to bring her sister home and has visited Bray fifteen times in the hope of uncovering further evidence. ‘It hurts me to be here, but I keep coming back all the time -- because she's here somewhere and I need to find her,’ she says bravely of her search. ‘I try and block it all out my head and pretend it's not my sister. I hate putting these posters up. I see lamppost with missing dogs and cats and I'm having to put my sister's picture up,’ she says reaching breaking point. The police found Esra’s car abandoned in the town’s parking lot, but there’s no proof Esra herself was the one who drove it there. 'There wasn't a shred of evidence she was ever in Bray because the CCTV footage is so appalling, you can't see who the driver is,’ explains Berna. 'All I want is an answer and that's when I'll be at peace. There’s a baby, who's now five years old, who's growing up without the love of his mum.' Because there’s never been a sighting of Esra since her disappearance, police have downgraded the investigation. The detective leading the search suspects suicide. 'I know she's here somewhere -- I just have to find her': Berna Fedan with a picture of her missing sister Esra Uryun . Blurry CCTV footage showed a female walking from where the car was parked towards Bray Head, a nearby hill. 'I can't say whether that's Esra or not but I can say the CCTV does not pick up that person coming back down,’ the detective explains. But Berna is convinced the woman is not her sister. The detective believes the passing of Esra’s father in 2010 may be linked. ‘It affected Esra more because she was living away from her family,’ he says and adds, ‘In 70 per cent of suicides, there's no note.’ But Berna is far from convinced and continues to publicise her plight. 'What damn proof do they have that my sister's dead? 'How can you commit suicide and no one come across the body in such a public place. It's still a search in my eyes. She could not bear to be away from her son.’ As she prepares to leave Bray, where she will no doubt return, Berna explains, ‘It’s hard coming and it’s even harder going back. She’s my flesh and blood, my only sister. She’d do the same if it was me.’ ‘I know I‘m torturing myself but how can I let it go? With no closure, how can I let it go. It’s impossible,’ she says. Berna continues her search to bring her beloved sister home but, like thousands of families round Britain, a lifetime of uncertainty may lie ahead. Berna Fidan’s search is featured in the Channel 4 series The Missing, which starts today at 10pm. The charity Missing People is at: missingpeople.org.uk .",

        "document": "Lebanese authorities have arrested a wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- the man spearheading the Islamist terror group's sweeping rampage across Syria and Iraq -- said a source with knowledge of the arrest. The woman is one of al-Baghdadi's two wives. Her arrest came as part of a \"planned operation,\" according to the source. The source described her as a \"powerful figure (who is) heavily involved in ISIS.\" Not much is known about the reported wife, including what her involvement is with the terrorist group, if any. \"We will gain some intelligence from her. We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. Another intelligence source identified the wife as Saja al-Dulaimi. She was detained with her 4-year-old son more than a week ago when they tried to enter Lebanon, that source said. The arrest was a coordinated operation involving agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, said the intelligence source. The source said the Iraqis had help from U.S. intelligence. In Washington, the CIA declined to comment. Also in Washington, several American sources suggested the person arrested was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one. Al-Baghdadi has been calling for the release of his son, the intelligence source said, adding that al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody in March as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in exchange for a group of Syrian nuns. The Greek Orthodox nuns had been kidnapped and held captive by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which al-Baghdadi had helped establish. Lebanese authorities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN. Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified Lebanese security officials, reported one of al-Baghdadi's sons was detained. But Reuters, also citing Lebanese officials, said that a daughter, rather than a son, was being held. The two agencies similarly differed on when the two were picked up by Lebanese forces: Reuters said it happened \"in recent days;\" AFP reported it was 10 days ago. Regardless, the very idea that a government may be holding close relatives of al-Baghdadi is significant, given his pivotal role in ISIS' meteoric rise, the extremist group's widely reviled tactics under his leadership and the breadth of the international coalition aimed at defeating ISIS. \"It's certainly a new dynamic because we've never seen anybody connected so close to al-Baghdadi being detained,\" terrorism expert Sajjan M. Gohel said. At the same time, the reports raise a lot of questions, such as what the family members might have been doing in Lebanon. \"Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?\" asked Gohel, who is the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation. Lebanon is one of several countries heavily affected by Syria's yearslong conflict and the flood of refugees trying to escape the violence. Lebanese authorities \"have been cracking down very heavily on the border to prevent members of ISIS seeping into Lebanon,\" Gohel said. \"They don't want the problems spilling over from Iraq and Syria into their territory.\" Another question raised by the reports is whether the wife is affiliated with ISIS. \"If she's simply an ex-wife, the first thing you got to deal with is she's an innocent person, potentially, who was married to a bad guy, with a child,\" said Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official. \"The first hurdle ... before we deal with what she knows, is how closely was she affiliated, and how hard can you press her based on that affiliation.  That's an ethical question,\" he said. Mystery surrounds arrest of woman who may be ISIS leader's wife . ISIS rises after al-Baghdadi took over . The group that in 2006 would become ISIS began in Iraq, where it targeted the U.S.-led coalition as well as Shiite Muslims in the country. It suffered heavy losses, but ascended over the past few years to take advantage of a void wrought by Syria's civil war as well as instability in Iraq. Not coincidentally, this all happened after al-Baghdadi took over ISIS in 2010. Before that, he'd been at a U.S. prison camp for insurgents at Bucca in southern Iraq, where he was taken after being detained in February 2004 amid fighting in the flashpoint city of Falluja. Media reports have claimed U.S. authorities held al-Baghdadi for four years. But the Pentagon has offered a different  time line, saying he was at Camp Bucca until early December 2004, when officials there recommended his \"unconditional release.\" Beyond this, little is known about al-Baghdadi. According to the U.S. government, he was born in Samarra, Iraq, and is in his early 40s. What motivates him, how he was trained and who he's close to -- including his family -- largely remains a mystery. He has emerged from the shadows in fits and spurts. After the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, al-Baghdadi issued a eulogy in which he threatened violent retribution. (Al Qaeda disowned ISIS earlier this year, blaming it for \"the enormity of the disaster that afflicted\" others trying to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.) There were unconfirmed suggestions last month that al-Baghdadi had been wounded in airstrikes in northern Iraq. But days later, an audio recording emerged that purportedly contained a message from al-Baghdadi saying the U.S.-led coalition to destroy ISIS is \"terrified, weak and powerless.\" 'He's created this myth' ISIS itself has never been more powerful, having taken over vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years. And it has used brutal tactics to do so -- such as mass kidnappings, rapes, killings and other abuses against civilians and fighting foes alike, actions that a U.N. panel characterized as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Al-Baghdadi, who has gone by a variety of aliases during his career in terrorism, has been at the center of it. The U.S. State Department's Reward's for Justice program, which refers to him as \"Abu Du'a,\" offers $10 million for information leading to his arrest. When his group rebranded itself as the Islamic State in June, al-Baghdadi was tapped as spiritual leader of the new caliphate. He's sought to burnish his theological credentials, with a biography posted on jihadist websites last year claiming he had earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad. \"His knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence is somewhat dubious, but nevertheless he's created this myth and this aura behind him,\" Gohel said.",

        "document": "By . Sarah Griffiths . You may have created a battery using a potato or a lemon in a physics class at school. But one artist has taken the humble experiment a step further by using an array of fruit from limes to apples in order to make self-powered lights that light up his photographs. Caleb Charland uses nails hidden inside the fruit which are connected with copper to make batteries, inspired by the classic potato classroom experiment. Scroll down for video . A bright idea: An artist has taken the humble potato battery experiment a step further by using a vast array of fruit from limes to oranges (pictured) in order to make self-powered lights . The popular school experiment involves inserting two electrodes made of different metals into a potato or lemon to generate a small amount of electricity. Almost any liquid or moist object that has enough ions to be electrically conductive can serve as the electrolyte for a cell. The fruit/vegetable battery is a simple type of electrical battery that illustrates their main components. They are used in schools to illustrate the type of chemical reaction - oxidation-reduction - that occurs in batteries. A piece of zinc (such as a galvanised nail) and a piece of copper (wire or a penny) are used as electrodes, while the juice inside is the electrolyte. Several lemons or potatoes can be wired together to form a more powerful battery that will power a light, buzzer or digital clock. Fruit batteries are similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice. The artist, from Bangor, Maine, transforms the fruit into electrochemical cells, which he arranges artistically before taking long-exposure photographs of his work in a bid to highlight the potential of sustainable energy. The fruit itself provides enough light to illuminate the photographs, which are all taken in the dark. He writes on his website: ‘To understand the world and to profit from it one must interact with it, one must experiment. ‘My practice as an artist combines a scientific curiosity with a constructive approach to making pictures. ‘I utilise everyday objects and fundamental forces to illustrate experiences of wonder. Mr Charland explained that his Back to Light project ‘expands upon a classic grade school science project, the potato battery.

        "document": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 10 members of Pakistan's military were killed in a gun battle with Taliban militants at a naval base in the coastal city of Karachi, authorities said Monday. The clashes raged for hours after attackers with guns and grenades stormed the compound Sunday night. By Monday afternoon, the base had \"been cleared from the terrorists,\" a Pakistani navy spokesman said. In addition to the 10 dead, at least 15 other Pakistani troops were wounded in the fighting, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said. Investigators have found the bodies of three attackers and believe a fourth is buried in debris, he said. They suspect two militants escaped, he said, citing witness reports. The Pakistani Taliban said the attack at the Mehran naval air station was to avenge the killing of innocent civilians. The group's spokesman, Ihsan Ullah, told CNN on Monday that Pakistani security forces are carrying out those killings on the instruction of the United States in the name of a \"war on terror.\" One of the attackers had detonated a suicide jacket, Malik said, and another one was found wearing an undetonated jacket. \"We have daily 9/11 in this country. You see how we are suffering,\" he said. \"And therefore, this is my appeal to the international community ... trust us, trust us, because this is a time we need you to support us morally.\" Authorities said militants wielding rocket launchers, automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked the base about 11 p.m. Sunday. They used ladders to scale a wall at the back of the base and jumped into the compound, Malik said. Two witnesses -- Amjad Bashir and Talha Hashmi -- reported at least 10 explosions in the subsequent hours. Each blast was typically followed by a sustained exchange of gunfire, Hashmi said. He said that several of the explosions -- thought to be the result of two military aircraft and a fuel tank catching fire and releasing plumes of smoke -- were particularly large. The attackers destroyed two P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft sold by the United States to Pakistan, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. Six American contractors at the base during the attack moved to safety and were not injured, he said. The nation's military personnel responded with what an Malik called a \"major operation\" at the base, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Karachi's main airport. According to the Pakistani navy's website, the Mehran base \"is efficiently supporting day and night operational activities of all (naval aviation) squadrons.\" A host of courses are also offered on its grounds, from helicopter and air navigation instruction to sea survival. The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is separate from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda. Karachi, which is considered the main commercial hub of Pakistan, has seen a drastic increase in political, ethnic and religious violence in recent months. Just over three weeks ago, three people were killed and at least 20 were injured when a hand grenade exploded at a gambling club in the southern Pakistani city. The grenade was tossed into the club by one of two unidentified people riding past the facility on a motorbike, according to Javed Baloch, a senior police official in Karachi. The Taliban said it was behind an April 28 roadside bombing on a main road through Karachi that left at least five dead and 10 injured. Two days earlier, three were killed and more than 30 wounded when remote-controlled bombs detonated near two buses carrying Pakistani navy officials. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Stan Grant, Nasir Habib, Greg Botelho, Jack Maddox, Aliza Kassim and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.",

A woman with narcolepsy who suffers up to six sleep attacks a day has had her life transformed by a very special dog. Annick, 35, from Belgium, never knows when she will drop off. She slept up to 16 hours a day and needed careful supervision from her parents. But she has been given a new lease of life thanks to the arrival of a little white dog called Idefix. The five-year-old mixed-breed dog is trained to wake her by nipping her ankles or ears at train and bus stops or when he hears an alarm. New lease of life: Idefix has been trained to nip gently at Annick's ankles and ears if she suffers a sleep attack . Wakey wakey! Idefix can spend up to half an hour rousing his narcoleptic owne .

Hospital in La Louvière, who came up with the novel solution, told Mail . Online: 'Annick couldn't do simple routine tasks such as ironing or . cooking because it was too dangerous if she fell asleep. 'She is now able to move around the city, meet friends, arrive at appointments on time, cook and go for walks.' It is one of the first times a dog has ever been trained as an assistance dog for someone with a sleep disorder. However, . the road to creating a successful pairing was not a smooth one. The . team were turned down by a number of animal charities until one called . 'Coeur a coeur' agreed to help. The charity trains hearing-assistant . dogs who are selected for their interest in sounds. Sadly . their first trainee dog had to be turned down because he couldn't be . stopped from running after trams. Quick learner: Idefix was trained to respond to various cues by waking up his owner . The five-year-old dog is the first trained to help someone with a sleep disorder . Then charity trainer Chantal picked . out Idefix - so named after the dog in the cartoon Asterix. 'He had a slightly peculiar character,' Dr Le Bon said. 'He was rather isolated from the other dogs and was quite stubborn.' Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological condition producing disruption to the normal sleep pattern. This produces excessive daytime sleepiness that can prove impossible to resist.They may therefore nap during normal activities such as eating and talking. It affects around one in 4,000 people and usually develops during adolescence. The precise cause is unknown though the neurotransmitter orexin is thought to be involved. There is no known cure. Scheduled naps and exercise can help ease symptoms. Stimulants can be prescribed but have significant side-effects. Further information from the NHS here . Idefix took to the unusual training . straight away. Over the course of a year he learnt to wake up Annick on . hearing an alarm clock in the morning, even if this required half an . hour of gentle biting. The five-year-old dog was then . trained to wake his owner up when he heard her mobile phone ring or when . a timer went off. Finally he learnt to wake her  at the next bus, metro or tram stop if she had nodded off on public transport. Annick's new canine companion has given her the independence she has long craved for. She said: 'I had been handicapped by my condition for many years and now I feel like I have been given a second life.' Meanwhile Dr Le Bon hopes more dogs will be trained to help narcoleptic patients who don't respond to medication. 'I have met several other patients with sleep disorders who are interested in our success, and the charity Couer a couer has agreed to do the training,' he said. Annick's unique case has been reported in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal.",

        "document": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 17 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 17 December 2013 . Arrest: Linda Cooney shot her adult son nearly 20 years after she shot dead her ex-husband . A mother who was acquitted after shooting her ex-husband dead 20 years ago is now facing charges for shooting her adult son and paralyzing him - with the same gun. Linda Cooney, 64, was cleared in the death of James Cooney on February 7, 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle after she claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife. Then in June 2011, she shot her son Kevin, 32, in the neck in Las Vegas with the same .357 Magnum after an argument about his girlfriend, whom Linda Cooney had been accused of stalking. Again, Cooney, a former legal secretary, claimed she shot out of self defense after her 6ft 9 inch son, a bouncer at a local club, had attacked her during the argument. Attorneys are now discussing whether . or not a jury in the newest case against Linda Conney should know about . her acquittal; her defense team argues it is not necessary as she was . found not guilty. A hearing will be held on Friday to determine the decision. Interestingly, . Kevin Cooney's testimony when he was just 11 years old had been key to . his mother's acquittal, the prosecutor in the case, Peter Magrino, told . the Sun Sentinel. He had initially told police that his father's hands were empty when he saw him killed on the floor, but in the 1993 trial in Palm Beach, Florida he said that his father may have been holding something. Injured: She claimed her son Kevin, pictured, had tried to attack her so she shot him in self defense. He has become less cooperative with prosecutors since speaking with his mother, they said . Charges: Linda Cooney, charged with murder in her ex-husband's death, is taken into court Tuesday. When the hearing continues Monday, Cooney's attorney, Richard Lubin, will ask Circuit Judge Marvin Mounts Jr. to release Cooney without bond . 'Unfortunately, the children were at . such a young age and had been so traumatized, it presented the . prosecution with a problem in terms of the inconsistency of their . statements,' Magrino said. Las Vegas prosecutors are concerned the son could again testify positively for his mother, who has been speaking to him via his brother's cell phone from hospital, authorities say. The argument that led to the shooting came after years of tension over Kevin Cooney's girlfriend, Karina Taylor, whom he met in 2009 but did not tell his mother. Taylor told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting Linda Cooney because she was 'crazy and it would cause nothing but problems'. And when Cooney did finally meet Taylor, she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a series of texts calling her a 'stripper,' 'w****,' 'prostitute' and 'skank'. She also reached told a non-profit cancer organization where Taylor volunteered and said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs, prosecutors said. Home: They argued over Kevin's girlfriend, whom Linda had allegedly called a 'skank' and 'w****' Prosecutors added that Taylor was genuinely fearful of Cooney, and this led to the argument on June 28, 2011. Police received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from Cooney and one from Kevin's younger brother, Chris, a Las Vegas police officer. But the calls came after a 15-minute call between Cooney and Chris. By this point, Kevin had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not feel his legs. When Chris called police, he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him, and Linda Cooney called police to say her son had been shot in the neck. Cooney refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son, although at one point said: 'The gun, it's my fault, it's my fault.' When police arrived, Kevin was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him, he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident. In November 2011, Chris visited his brother at the hospital and allowed his mother to talk to his brother on his cell phone - and Kevin has since been less cooperative with prosecutors. Linda Cooney was charged with bribing or intimidating a witness to influence testimony but Chris Cooney was not charged. Chris testified last year that his brother had a history of being physically abusive.",

        "document": "Manchester City take a break from their revitalised title challenge to begin their latest FA Cup quest this weekend. The Barclays Premier League champions host Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the knockout competition on Sunday. It is the second time City have faced the Owls this season, having thrashed them 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pellegrini speak about the importance of the FA Cup . Manchester City are flying high in the Premier League and are challenging Chelsea for top spot . Manuel Pellegrini insists his side are focused on the FA Cup after missing out on the Capital One Cup . Now City are in even greater form having gone unbeaten in their last 12 games, winning 10 of them. Their hot sequence has seen them claw back an eight-point deficit to draw level with Chelsea in the Premier League and reach the knockout stages of the Champions League. It seems a daunting task for Wednesday but, coming soon after the draining Christmas programme, manager Manuel Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted. The Chilean said: 'It has been a difficult moment because we played three games in a week, very important games in the Premier League. 'We had to play for nine points in one week but we have finished that and now we must think about Sheffield Wednesday. 'For our team it is a very important cup. Last year we were eliminated here against Wigan but we won the Capital One Cup. 'This year we are eliminated from the Capital One so we will try to continue in the FA Cup as far as we can.' City were knocked out by Wigan in the last year and the Pellegrini is determined not to see a repeat . Sheffield Wednesday will be hoping to repeat Wigan's heroics at the Etihad Stadium this weekend . City were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle in October amid a poor spell that saw them win just once in six games. That brought scrutiny of Pellegrini and his methods but doubts appear to have been swept away by City's form since the November international break. It was at a similar stage last season when City began to click into top gear. Pellegrini said: 'For different reasons we had a low performance for around two weeks. 'We were not playing so bad in that moment but we made important mistakes and when you make mistakes the score is not what you want. After that, we arranged again the way we were playing. 'Important players returned to their normal performance and I am very happy with the way we are playing now. 'We still have so many injured players but we arrange in different ways and continue winning.' Vincent Kompany is nearing a return but won't be fit in time for the third round clash . Joe Hart could be on the sidelines again this weekend with Pellegrini hinting Willy Caballero will retain his place . Influential captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are the key players currently sidelined. Kompany is thought to be the closest to a return after calf and hamstring problems but has been ruled out of the Wednesday clash. Dzeko and Aguero are expected to return later in January. Midfielder Yaya Toure could face Wednesday in what would be his final appearance before joining up with Ivory Coast for the African Nations Cup. Pellegrini has hinted that second-choice goalkeeper Willy Caballero is likely to remain in the side after England number one Joe Hart was rested against Sunderland on New Year's Day. Pellegrini said: 'It is important when you play so many games - not only for Joe but for other players - to have an important rotation. 'I did the same in the Capital One for Willy Caballero. I think it's good for Willy, good for Joe and good for the team. It's exactly the same as other positions in the team.'",

Morosini's parents and brother died in his teens, and his death at the age of 25 leaves only his sister, Maria Carla. Morosini was playing on loan at Livorno from Serie A side Udinese, which said in a statement on its website that the severely disabled Maria Carla is cared for in a residential facility in Bergamo, and has \"no-one left but an elderly aunt.\" \"Our duty is now not to leave her alone after fate has taken away from her all her family,\" Udinese said. The club published the details of a bank account and is inviting donations from other clubs in order to establish a fund that will be administered by Maria Carla's legal guardian. Morosini died after suffering suspected cardiac arrest during the first half against Pescara. He was taken to hospital where doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him. All of the weekend's matches in the Italian league were postponed, and a period of silence was observed at many other games across the world. Former Italy Under-21 international Morosini moved to Udinese in 2005, but made only five appearances and had been loaned out to several clubs. He joined Livorno in January. \"He was an exceptional lad, so full of life,\" Udinese captain Antonio di Natale told the club's television channel. \"Despite all the problems he had, he was always at the disposal of the team and every day he gave us all strength.\" Di Natale said it was the club's duty to look after Morosini's sister. \"We know the situation of his sister and we as a team, the club, and Udinese for Life (the club charity) have decided to help her because she is in real need,\" he said. \"It is essential that we stay at the side of Piermario's sister for her entire life. She needs us and we want to help, both for her and for Mario.\" Livorno announced Monday it has retired the No. 25 shirt that Morosini was wearing at the time of his death.",

Labour leader Ed Miliband will admit in his party political broadcast that immigration has let too many low-skilled workers into Britain, undercutting wages . Ed Miliband will admit today that Labour was wrong on immigration and let too many low-skilled migrants into Britain. In a party political broadcast tonight, the Labour leader will say that communities struggled to keep up with the speed of new arrivals to Britain. And he will concede that the scale of immigration meant workers' wages have been undercut. Mr Miliband will pledge to introduce a ‘One Nation immigration policy’ for the many and not the few. But his party, which has consistently refused to support a cap on numbers, will again fail to spell out any firm policies to cut immigration. In an astonishing about-face, Mr Miliband will say: ‘Low-skill migration has been too high and we need to bring it down. ‘That . means the maximum transitional controls for new countries coming in . from Eastern Europe, it means properly enforcing the minimum wage so . people aren’t brought here to undercut workers already here, and it . means proper training for people here so that they have a fighting . chance of filling the vacancies that exist. ‘There’s . nothing wrong in employing people from abroad but the rules need to be . fair so that local people get a fair crack of the whip.’ In . an attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open-door’ immigration . policy, which let hundreds of thousands of migrants from new EU . countries come to Britain, he will add that it is ‘not prejudiced when . people worry about immigration, it’s understandable’. Jobs: In the film, Mr Miliband will admit that Labour got immigration 'wrong in government' and promise more training for British workers to fill jobs . Mr . Miliband will say that every foreigner who settles in Britain should . learn English, and all public-sector workers who deal directly with the . public must be able to speak English. And he promise to step up enforcement of the minimum wage to ensure that migrant workers are not paid less to undercut Britons. But . a Tory source said: ‘Vague rhetoric about One Nation does nothing to . explain how Labour would control the number of people coming into . Britain.’ And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'What will you do Mr Miliband, about the relaxing of controls on Bulgarians and Romanians? Are you prepared to defy the EU treaties and take back our border controls? If not these comments are mere crocodile tears.' Diane Abbott appeared to torpedo Mr Miliband’s change of tack, insisting Labour would not pander to ‘anti-immigrant’ feelings. Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Labour’s public health spokesman wrote: ‘There is no path to victory for the Labour Party through the thickets of anti-immigrant politics.’ Mr Miliband will attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open door’ immigration policy which led to hundreds of thousands of migrants from the new EU countries coming to Britain as the UK did not introduce transitional controls. Family: Mr Miliband (right) filmed the broadcast at The party political broadcast was filmed at Acton College in West London, where his late, Polish father the academic Ralph Miliband came to study English 70 years ago . Nearly 600,000 European migrants came to the UK in 2010 alone, making Labour’s predictions of just 13,000 incomers from the new EU countries laughable. Mr Miliband will say: 'One of the things I've done since I became the leader of the Labour Party is understand where we got things wrong in government, and change them. 'And one of the things we didn't get right was immigration, and that's why I've got a new approach. Millions of people in this country are concerned about immigration and if people are concerned about it, then the Labour Party I lead is going to be talking about it.' Labour's public health spokesman Diane Abbott appeared to torpedo Ed Miliband's plans saying the party would not pander to 'anti-immigrant' feelings . He will add: 'Britain's diversity is a source of our great strength. It makes us a more successful country. 'But people can lose out if migration isn't properly managed. The pace of change can be too fast or people can see their wages undercut.' The party political broadcast was filmed at Acton College in West London, where Mr Miliband’s late, Polish father the academic Ralph Miliband came to study English 70 years ago after fleeing the Nazis. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will make a speech on immigration tomorrow in which she will unveil plans to crackdown on unscrupulous employers who force migrants into overcrowded housing and pay them below the minimum wage. She will also target 'gangmasters' employing illegal migrants in the social care, hospitality and construction industries - including a ban on housing workers in over-crowded accommodation. Ms Cooper is also expected to detail proposed reforms of the immigration system and action to improve the training of UK workers so they can fill jobs in shortage occupations. The news came as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said migrants could face a minimum period before they could claim tax credits and out-of-work benefits. Sources said it could be introduced before the lifting of restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants this year.",

Rescue workers dug through mudslides as they struggled today to reach thousands of villagers cut off by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 53 people and damaged more than 100,000 homes in mountainous north-eastern India, Nepal and Tibet. Heavy rains slowed the relief effort and made conditions miserable for many homeless villagers as they prepared to spend the night outside. Three emergency workers were killed in the frantic rescue effort, Indian Home Secretary RK Singh said. Hole in the wall: huvadra Pathi looks out from her apartment after a section of it collapsed in an earthquake in Kathmandu . Search for survivors: Nepalese police search for casualties in the ruins of a quake-damaged house at Lokanthali in Bhaktapur . More than 6,000 army and paramilitary troops were working to clear concrete slabs, bricks and mud to rescue scores of people trapped under houses that collapsed when the 6.9-magnitude quake struck the Himalayan region yesterday evening. Nine helicopters dropped food to villages, airlifted a medical team, evacuated the injured and conducted damage assessments, Singh said. Heavy construction equipment was used to clear some of the blocked roads, he said. 'The rescue and relief operations are in full swing though they were hampered ... by poor weather,' Mr Singh said. Collapse: Locals congregate by a house after a wall came down in the quake . Structural damage: Two women look from a window in Bhaktapur which was badly cracked in the quake . By midday today, workers had managed to clear mudslides from one lane of the main highway leading to the Indian state of Sikkim, where the quake was centred near the Nepal border, Singh said. An initial convoy of 75 paramilitary soldiers started moving toward Mangan, the village closest to the epicentre, but still had not arrived by evening. At least 32 people died and 100 others were injured in Sikkim, Singh said. At least 10 of them worked for the same hydroelectric project, but it was not immediately clear how they died. Seven other people were killed in the neighbouring Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal, Mr Singh said. Victims: Two adults and a child died in Kathmandu when the British Embassy wall fell during the quake . Crushed: Members of the Nepalese army gather around a damaged car after the wall surrounding the British Embassy in Kathmandu collapsed . China's official Xinhua News Agency reported seven deaths and 24 injuries in Tibet. It said the quake triggered hundreds of landslides that disrupted power and water supplies. Nepal's government said seven people died there, including two men and a child who were killed when a brick wall toppled outside the British Embassy in the capital, Kathmandu. Nearly 70 people were injured, some of them seriously, and were in hospitals across Nepal. Most of the deaths in India occurred when houses, already weakened from recent monsoon rains, collapsed due to the force of the quake. More than 100,000 homes were damaged in Sikkim state alone, state officials said. Rescue mission: Nepalese troops on the streets of Kathmandu after the quake hit last night with a magnitude of 6.9 . Mr Singh said it was still unclear what the final toll might be. 'There may still be villages where people are trapped under collapsed houses that we have not been able to reach,' he said. TV broadcasters showed footage of buildings buckled, pavements cracked and two major roads collapsed in Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, 40 miles south-east of the quake's epicentre. Police cordoned off the office of the state's top elected official after the building was severely damaged, police Chief Jasbir Singh said. In West Bengal state, utility workers toiled to restore power to a large . swathe of the state which plunged into darkness after power lines were . snapped by the quake. The region has been hit by major earthquakes in the past, including in 1950 and 1897.",

        "document": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Doctors and nurses face being banned from eating junk food in hospital canteens to force them to set an example to patients. NHS England boss Simon Stevens said staff must 'get our own act together' before it can lecture the public on cutting down on calories. He said too many hospitals serve 'chips and burgers' to both patients and staff, and suggested more 'positive incentives' should be offered to encourage healthier meals. Too many hospital canteens serve junk food like burgers and chips to staff and patients, the head of the NHS has warned . Around 700,000 of the NHS's 1.3 million staff are either overweight or obese and Mr Stevens wants to introduce incentives for them to lose weight. More gyms are to be built and NHS sites will become increasingly cycle friendly, while prizes such as pedometers will be on offer for staff who shed the pounds. Mr Stevens said the rising obesity epidemic of recent years was bad both for people's health and for the health service itself, and tackling obesity would put less pressure on the nation's finances and would free up funding for new treatments. Recent figures show that almost three quarters of people aged 45 to 74 in England are either overweight or obese. Young adults are the only age group who have a normal average body mass index, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The NHS is facing a funding crisis and senior health figures have said it may need an extra £30 billion by 2020 to maintain the current level of service provision. NHS England boss Simon Stevens (right) said staff must 'get our own act together' before it can lecture the public on cutting down on calories . The clock could be turned back on staff meals, with nurses and doctors offered simpler, healthier meals . Promising to tackle the obesity problem, Mr Stevens told The Sun: 'It's hard for the NHS to talk about how important this is if we don't get our own act together. I think the NHS has got to take an example in helping our own staff and hopefully other employers will follow suit. 'A lot of the food in hospital canteens, not just for patients, but for staff, is chips and burgers. The NHS as an employer, for our own nurses and other staff, could we offer positive incentives? Yes, I think we could. And some hospitals have begun doing that.' Mr Stevens also called on parents to help keep their children healthy by swapping juices and fizzy drinks during meal times for water or milk. Looking to the future, he said that further progress in technology would keep patients out of hospital as people live longer, and he wants greater partnership between the NHS and social services. He said: 'What's great about the NHS can't excuse what needs to change about the NHS. That is the approach that we have got to take. We've got to support people doing great things, nurses, doctors, the frontline of healthcare. But we've also got to raise our game.' He also called for thousands more GPs to be trained, and wants to give them more power to make decisions about how NHS money is spent.",

Sanchez is scoring at such a prolific rate he would eclipse even Henry in full flow. His late winner was his 14th in his last 18 games for Arsene Wenger’s team and completely transformed the mood of a frustrating night. He is a worthy heir to Henry’s mask and cape. For 88 minutes, the Emirates Stadium had grumbled and grown increasingly agitated as chances came and went. Many were missed by Daniel Welbeck and supporters chanted for Olivier Giroud to be unleashed from the bench. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Arsenal 1-0 Southampton .

Fraser Forster performed superbly in the Southampton goal, reaching out his giant paws to produce save upon save, the best to keep out a looping header from Giroud. A minute later, however, Forster was beaten as his defensive shield tired and made a rare mistake. They were down to 10 men having lost Toby Alderweireld to injury after Ronald Koeman had used all his substitutes. It allowed Aaron Ramsey to collect a stray ball in the Saints penalty area and cut it towards Sanchez, who gleefully turned it over the line. It was a shame for Forster, who did not deserve to be beaten. But a triumph of sorts for Arsenal, who have won three on the bounce after losing at home to Manchester United and have kept three clean sheets with rookie goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in the team. Wenger confessed he was a little ‘cautious’ of declaring his problems were in the past. It was a relief to be stronger in defence, and he was grateful to have Laurent Koscielny back. But while tightening up at one end, his side seemed to lose some punch at the other, although piercing Southampton’s defensive shield is no mean feat. This was only the 10th goal they have conceded in 14 games. They are the best in the Barclays Premier League, superbly well-drilled and committed. Even when a first-half injury to Jack Cork had forced a reshuffle, with Alderweireld moving from central defence to midfield, they remained solid while dangerous on the break. Sanchez (front) tries to go past Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne on Wednesday night . Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini (bottom) perfectly times a sliding challenge on Saints striker Graziano Pelle . Gunners boss Arsene Wenger (centre) watches proceedings as his side seek that elusive first goal at the Emirates . Southampton were dealt a blow midway through the first half when midfielder Jack Cork (bottom) pulled up with a hamstring injury . Cork (right) was replaced by defender Maya Yoshida (centre) as Toby Alderweireld was moved into central midfield from centre back . ‘We were unlucky with the injuries,’ said Koeman. ‘That gave Arsenal the motivation to carry on until the last second. Fraser Forster was outstanding but it not enough. That’s the risk in football. A lot of players are having hamstring problems. When it’s a kick maybe you can ask a player for five minutes more but it was a hamstring and you can’t continue as a player.’ It is a third game without a win for the Saints and the temptation is to think their bubble has burst. Next up are Manchester United, at St Mary’s on Monday, but Wenger said: ‘Don’t bury them too quickly. They are a good side. You have to count with Southampton for the top four. ‘Up front they are quick to come out, up front always first on the ball. They play in a very intelligent way. You always see they are a threat.’ Having won here in the Capital One Cup in September, Southampton arrived with confidence and Koeman’s fluent team did not take long to open up Arsenal. Graziano Pelle and Steven Davis linked up neatly on the edge of the penalty area to create a clear chance for the Italian but his volley soared over. Koeman claimed it was the best chance of the half, although Welbeck had already missed one just as good. Santi Cazorla unzipped the defence for Welbeck who, having been restored to a central role with fit-again Giroud resting on the bench, swept the ball wide. Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (centre) battled his way into the Southampton box before firing a backheel shot towards goal . Unfortunately for the 23-year-old (centre) he can only watch on as his strike fails to find the back of the net . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was denied by Forster and a slip by Maya Yoshida, soon after coming on nearly proved costly. Welbeck, however, was unable to convert an ambitious back-heel from a tight angle. Forster made a reflex save to deny Welbeck in stoppage time at the end of the first-half. Welbeck’s glancing header from a free-kick swung in from the left by Sanchez, hit Alderweireld and deflected towards goal. It was directly at Forster, but the England goalkeeper had to be quick to turn it over. Koscielny produced a smart block to thwart Pelle soon after the restart and Shane Long darted clear on the right only to miss the goal by some considerable distance. Welbeck was soon in the thick of the action before half-time when he saw his fine header denied by man-of-the-match Forster . Forster (right) lept up brilliantly to tip over Welbeck's effort up and over his crossbar in the first half . The England international (centre) was brilliant throughout the match, this time denying Aaron Ramsey in the second half (right) Arsenal were far more direct and threatening once Giroud was sent on for the last 25 minutes. Up went the pressure on Forster’s goal but the England keeper only increased in stature and confidence. He beat away a sweet volley by Giroud at his near post and then made another splendid reaction save from Welbeck, throwing out a strong left hand and clawing the ball out. Cazorla fired high and Wenger climbed to his feet as Arsenal fans roared on their side in search of a winner. Aware that Chelsea were winning across the capital, they did not want to surrender more ground at the top of the table, but it was heading that way until Sanchez pounced. ‘He has such desire to fight and find something special to get the goal,’ said Wenger. ‘We are in December and he only arrived in July. When you look at his goals and the impact he has had on the team it is tremendous.’ VIDEO Koeman unhappy with second half performance .

        "document": "The parents of a popular track star at the University of Pennsylvania who committed suicide on Friday, begged her not to go back to school when she revealed she was unhappy over Christmas. The death of 19-year-old freshman Madison Holleran has rocked UPenn community and sent shockwaves through her hometown of Allendale, New Jersey. And the tragedy has come even more into focus as her devastated family and friends have revealed her sadness stemmed from the strains the student found herself under since going to college. Her father James Holleran told the New York Post the student was struggling with her school workload while a family friend revealed her supportive parents told her she could stay home or transfer at Christmas. But sadly the determined teen insisted on going back. Holleran posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to her Instagram account around 6pm on Friday night - just an hour before police say she jumped to her death from a city center building. She was pronounced dead at the scene at 7.17pm, the New Jersey Record reported. No one else was injured. Loss: Madison Holleran, a track and field star at UPenn, has jumped to her death. Her father James, right, said she had taken her life because she was overwhelmed by the workload at her new school . Final moments: She posted this image of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death . Her . father told the New York Post that she killed herself because she was . overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn - changing her from the happy . student she had been throughout high school. 'There . was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' James Holleran tearfully told . the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and . stress.' Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist. 'We . knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost . confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track . abilities.' On the day that . she jumped to her death, her father texted her that morning encouraging . her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she . would. But just hours later, . she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family . on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not . detail the contents of the note. Distraught: Madison, who was one of five children, poses at a Penn meet with her mother Stacy . Beautiful: Hundreds of friends have shared their condolences on Madison's social networking pages . Popular: Madison, pictured left with a friend just months ago at Halloween, was remembered as 'bright and well-liked' by university staff . Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents. Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself. 'People talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News. “This kid didn’t have a boyfriend. There were no drug issues. There were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last two, three weeks where they saw a change in her,' said Weckworth. 'Something snapped.' 'She got a 3.5 her first semester, and I think just the high expectations that she put on herself was that that’s just not acceptable. 'She was not happy at Penn, but the parents had told her then, ‘Don’t go back. We’ll transfer. We’ll look at other schools. There’s no reason to go back, it’s OK,’' he said. Madison's funeral will be held today and her family have asked well-wishers to donate to . the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in lieu of flowers. Holleran . was a member of the university's varsity track and field team at UPenn. Her teammates were given the option of whether or not they wished to . compete in Saturday's meet. The school also canceled formal recruitment for sororities, in which Holleran was set to take part. 'The . entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison . Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement. 'She . was bright and well-liked with an incredible future ahead of her. There . are simply no words that can properly convey the sense of heartache . that we all feel at such a tragic loss.' 'Our thoughts and prayers are with . [Holleran's] family and friends,' said Steve Dolan, Penn's director of . track and field, in a statement to the Daily Pennsylvanian. Promising: The athlete had been one of the most promising track stars to come out of her New Jersey county . Missed: The UPenn community was shaken by the death of Holleran, right, on Friday evening . 'This is a challenging time . for everyone involved with the program, but we will support each other . in the weeks to come and help her teammates and friends find their own . ways to honor her memory.' Holleran, . who was majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, had been a . standout track and soccer athlete in her high school. She originally planned to play soccer at Lehigh University before switching her mind, and choosing to run at Penn. She had been named to the . New Jersey Star-Ledger's all-state girls track team last year, while the Record . named her its Spring Athlete of the Season and Girls Indoor Track Athlete of the Year in 2013, the Star Ledger reported. Northern Highlands Girls Varsity Soccer, for which Holleran had played, tweeted: 'RIP . Madison. You are our beloved NHGS sister forever and always. You have . and always will be such a special person. We love you.' A funeral for Holleran, who is one of five children, is expected to be held on Tuesday.

The divers do admit to being more afraid in dark water, but if the water is clear, they have no problems . The stunning collection of images were taken during trips to widespread locations, including the Maldives, Guadalup Island in Mexico, Azores Island and Colombia. And the pair have witnessed first hand the beauty of some of other, perhaps less dangerous, animals - including blue sharks, whale sharks, leopard seals and hordes of fish.

        "document": "(CNN) -- The captain is still in charge. No matter how technologically advanced a cruise ship may be or how modern its safety procedures or how strict the web of international regulations, passenger safety still depends on the captain's ability to make good decisions. It's not clear what difference more stringent regulations would have played in the decisions of Captain Francesco Schettino, who allegedly deviated from a set route, abandoned ship after the disaster with passengers still aboard and did not return to the ship to lead rescue efforts when ordered by local port officials, according to transcripts between authorities and the captain. In light of the Concordia disaster, the new head of the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations agency responsible for shipping safety, security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships. \"We should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation,\" IMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu said in a statement released Monday. \"In the centenary year of the Titanic, we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities.\" Passengers first, then crew, then captain . In addition to the United Nations agency, a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies, often called \"flag administration.\" The ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops. (The Concordia didn't stop in U.S. ports carrying U.S. passengers, which means it wasn't subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations, according to Brad Schoenwald, senior marine inspector of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise.) In the Concordia case, the laws of Italy also apply. Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said. Abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in Spain, Greece and Italy, according to Alessandra Batassa, a lawyer in Rome, although many other countries have long abandoned it. Although U.S. law doesn't single out abandoning ship as a crime, it's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to maritime law professor Craig Allen, visiting professor of law at Yale University Law School and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. \"If you're going to be master of a ship, your responsibility is first to your passengers, second to your crew, then you look after yourself,\" said Allen, a Coast Guard veteran. \"It's shameless and dishonorable [for the captain] to take himself out of the mix like that.\" Current international regulation . Under current international regulations, each cruise company must have a safety plan, called a safety management system, that details responsibilities in the event of an emergency, Schoenwald said. In the event of a fire on board, the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified \"muster\" stations, where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency. If the incident is contained, passengers might be allowed to resume their normal activities or be kept away from the damaged part of the ship until a return to port, or they might be required to abandon ship. \"The call to abandon is made by the captain,\" Schoenwald said. \"When the abandon ship signal is made, they have 30 minutes to get everyone off the ship, even though the general emergency could have started a day or hour before.\" It's not clear to Miami maritime attorney Brett Rivkind why the captain didn't issue a mayday signal to call for outside help soon after the accident. \"[A captain needs] to know your ship and what danger your ship is in,\" he said. \"Tilting and listing is a pretty good sign\" of distress. Passengers can be prepared . While passengers have little or no control over the abilities of their captain or crew, disasters like the Concordia are rare. Still, passengers can take steps to ensure a safe trip much of the time. AAA Travel recommends that U.S. citizens who are traveling internationally register with the U.S. Department of State's free Smart Traveler Enrollment program (STEP) at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates, AAA spokeswoman Cynthia Brough said. This will help the State Department better help them during an emergency. Before you board, make a copy of your passport and have a bag with necessities like hard-to-replace medication, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, head of the Valerie Wilson Travel's cruise department. As soon as you board your ship and arrive at your room, find your life vest and participate in the mandatory safety drill, called a muster drill. \"If you've been on a number of cruises, you don't pay as close attention [to the muster drill] as you probably should,\" said John Deiner, managing editor of CruiseCritic.com. Though attendance is mandatory, he said, there are often a few people who skip the drill. Find out where you'll get a life jacket if an emergency keeps you from returning to your room for yours. During the cruise, place your purse and necessities in the same place in your room every time you enter. Whatever went wrong to cause or exacerbate the Concordia cruise ship disaster, most of the Concordia crew and passengers safely made it off the ship. And though the images of the disaster may turn off many people to cruising, experts say it's still one of the safest transportation methods available.

        "document": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court on Thursday postponed a decision on whether to grant bail to a Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Quran in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the capital, Islamabad. The Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl, identified as Rimsha, in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past. Tahir Naveed Choudhry, one of Rimsha's lawyers, has sought bail for her, saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail where adults are also being held. To back up his argument, Choudhry cited a report on Tuesday by an independent medical board stating that Rimsha was 14. The doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age. But on Thursday, the lawyer for the man accusing Rimsha queried the legal validity of the board's report. The lawyer, Rao Abdur Raheem, said the seven-doctor board was constituted by the local authorities, not by court order. As a result, the court adjourned until Saturday to allow time to verify the medical report. Raheem said he was representing the accuser free of charge because he believes God will reward him for his work. The police have said that Rimsha is illiterate and has not attended school. They said last week that she had told them that she had no idea that there were pages of the Quran inside the documents she alleged to have burned. The court faces a difficult decision amid concerns that if Rimsha is released on bail, she could be at risk from Muslims angered by the allegations against her. Choudhry, who is also a leading member of the Christian community and member of the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, said Rimsha is too young to stay in prison and would be safer joining her family, who are now in hiding. \"She was crying in the jail and missing her parents,\" he said. Choudhry says he expects Rimsha's trial to last as long as two years. She would remain in custody for its duration, if bail is denied, he said. If she is tried as a minor, she might also receive a milder sentence if convicted. As an adult, she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for willful desecration of the Quran, Choudhry said . Rimsha was accused by a local resident of burning pages of the Muslim holy text after she gathered paper as fuel for cooking in Islamabad, according to the authorities. The man said he found her carrying ashes that included burned pages of the Quran in a small bag. Choudhry has said that nobody actually saw Rimsha burning the papers. The case has already had a severe effect on people in the area. Hundreds of Christian families have had to leave the area for fear of violence, Choudhry said. The police said last week that about 150 people had gathered on August 17 -- the day Rimsha was arrested -- in the area where the neighborhood's Christian population lives and threatened to burn down their houses. In a statement last week, President Asif Ali Zardari said he had called for an urgent report on the incident and added that vulnerable sections of society must be protected \"from any misuse of the blasphemy law.\" \"Blasphemy by anyone cannot be condoned but no one will be allowed to misuse blasphemy law for settling personal scores,\" said the president's spokesman, Farhatullah Babar. Critics of the controversial law say it is being used to persecute religious minorities. \"If any Muslim is accused for blasphemy, people don't burn houses,\" Choudhry said. \"But if the accused is a non-Muslim, mob burns our entire villages.\" Pakistan is home to about 2 million Christians, who make up more than 1% of the Islamic nation's population, according to government statistics. Rimsha's case \"illustrates the erosion of the rule of law and the dangers faced by those accused of blasphemy in Pakistan,\" the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International said in a statement last week.

Fight: Nohad Halawi is pictured after her successful employment hearing today . A Christian worker who claims she was sacked from her job at Heathrow following a 'race hate' campaign by 'Muslim extremists' today vowed to take her unfair dismissal case 'all the way to Luxembourg' to the European Court of Justice. Nohad Halawi allegedly weathered cruel rumours that she was 'anti-Islamist,' on top of a systematic catalogue of intimidation that included telling the 48-year-old that she would go to Hell if she did not convert to Islam. Halawi, previously a beauty consultant for luxury cosmetics brand Shiseido, was then booted out of her 13-year-long job in Heathrow Airport's World Duty Free shop, after going to her seniors with concerns about the verbal tirades she was subjected to. She also claims 'extremist' colleagues brought the Koran to work to try and convert people to Islam and even handed out leaflets promoting terrorism, as well as declaring that it was 'a shame' the failed July 21 London bombings did not go off. Having taken her tribunal case to the courts in 2011, Halawi lost after it was ruled that as a part time and commissioned-based freelance she was not a staff employee. Today, however, she won the right to appeal. Speaking outside court, the mum-of-two from Weybridge, Surrey, told how the abuse started after she stuck up for a Christian colleague who was left in tears after Muslim staff made fun of her for wearing a cross necklace. She said: 'At first, because I am from Lebanon, they assumed I was Muslim but when they found out I wasn't they started bullying me.' Halawi, who came to Britain from Lebanon in 1977, continued: 'They used to say about 9/11 that it serves the American's right and that it was a shame the failed London bombings did not go off. When I asked them why they did not go back and live in their own country if they didn't like the UK, they said 'we came to the West to try and convert as many people to Islam as we can.' She also revealed insider knowledge on life within Heathrow: 'They keep coming to the airport and many of them work in security. It is terrible there. If they see that you are a Muslim they wave you through. One time they thought my husband was Muslim and said 'don't worry he is one of us' and let him through without checking him. And you're telling me this is safe security.' Employment: One of the World Duty Free stores at Heathrow Airport, where Halawi worked for 13 years . Mrs Halawi said she once found extremist leaflets in one of her Muslim colleague's drawers but the airport turned a blind eye. She said: \"Management told him to throw them away. I later found out he had been sacked from other terminals for handing them out and inciting religious hatred, but duty free covered it up as they are scared of labelled Islamophobic.\" She was fired in July 2011 after five Muslim colleagues complained she was anti-Islamic followed a heated conversation in the store. After her sacking 28 colleagues, some of them Muslims, signed a petition calling for her reinstatement claiming she was dismissed on the basis of \"malicious lies\", but it was unsuccessful. Having lost her first unfair dismissal campaign, Halawi received help from the Christian Legal Centre to further her case and has subsequently won a right to appeal. She added: 'I am not and have never been racist or anti religion. I have many Muslim friends. I am doing this because I want to show that people It's not fair to use the religion card. They've ruined my life. They've ruined my family's lives. I can't get work and am relying on friends and family to get by' A spokesperson for World Duty Free refused to comment because of the 'ongoing legal proceedings.'",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Just weeks before a Continental Connection commuter plane crashed near Buffalo, another airline had reminded its pilots about safety issues with instrument approaches at the airport. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. However, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it was extremely unlikely the February 12 crash and the warning were related. Instrument approaches are those in which pilots use cockpit displays to line up their aircraft with the runway when visibility is low. The alert, initially issued by Southwest Airlines and reissued Wednesday by the airline's pilot association, warned there was a \"potentially significant hazard\" concerning the instrument landing system's glide slope guidance signal for runway 23. The airline advised, \"Pilots who are preparing to configure and land have the potential to experience abrupt pitch up, slow airspeed, and approach to stall if conditions present themselves in a certain manner.\" Southwest Airlines spokesperson Linda Rutherford said an earthen dam at the end of the runway was interfering with the signal being sent to inbound flights. Rutherford would not confirm if any of Southwest's recent flights into Buffalo experienced problems on approach. \"We often put out alerts on obstructions to a navigation aid,\" Rutherford told CNN. She also pointed out, though landing on the same runway, Southwest Airlines flights approach runway 23 from the north, turning right, while the Colgan Air flight that crashed was approaching from the south turning left. Rutherford called that distinction important.  View a Google Earth image of runway 23 » . The National Transportation Safety Board told CNN the agency was \"aware\" of the Southwest Airlines alert, but would not comment further. The issue is caused by a geographic feature at the airport, a valley, \"something we can't do anything about,\" said FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. She said the \"altitude reading makes it look like you're a lot higher than you are, because there is a valley there.\" The feature has been noted on FAA charts for years, she said. \"As far as we can tell, there is no way this had any role in the accident,\" Brown told CNN. \"It's not a navigation aid that would have applied to the approach.\" The alert from Southwest Airlines advises pilots that the problem could cause the planes navigational system to interpret data \"in such a way as to result in a nose-up pitch and loss of airspeed.\" Flight data recorders obtained by the NTSB of the crashed Colgan air Flight 3407 show during its approach to runway 23, the twin turbo prop Dash-8 pitched up 31 degrees before going into a stall due to lack of airspeed. Southwest Airlines Pilot Association told its pilots the \"issue is being addressed on several levels in an attempt to address procedures, facilities, and communication regarding this matter.\" The alert advises any pilots experience trouble to contact the association's safety office.",

        "document": "By . Ryan Gorman . A woman had an epic meltdown this week on a Tampa, Florida-bound flight. The unidentified woman screamed over and over at the top of her lungs after going up and down the aisles of the plane telling people to pray for her deceased mother. ‘God you’re my savior,’ she repeated as often and quickly as possible, while contorting and shaking in her seat as shocked passengers tried not to draw her attention. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Seeking salvation: The blonde woman in this YouTube video had an epic meltdown as the man in the black hat tried to calm her down . The video, uploaded Wednesday to YouTube, has had well over 100,000 views, and shows the woman going . crazy as the plane lands in Tampa. Perhaps distraught over the recent loss of her mother, the woman is seen at the beginning of the video screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ at the top of her lungs. Shot by Reed Stanley, video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical woman trying to calm her down. His failure to calm her elicits an exasperated shrug of the shoulders. ‘She’s been freaking out for the last 20 minutes,’ Mr Stanley explains over the shouting woman. ‘She started off by telling everyone to pray for her mother who just passed away. ‘She went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother,’ Mr Stanley further explains as the woman’s tirade shows no signs of slowing down. ‘ . Get me out of here: The woman in the aisle seat can't get off the plane fast enough . The woman appears to be both looking at her powered on smartphone and reading a magazine while repeatedly screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ in non-stop repetition. The man sitting next to her continues to try to calm her down as passengers shown behind her are tiring of the routine. ‘I don’t know if this guy next to her knows her or not,’ Mr Stanley further narrates over the unending barrage of proclamation, ‘but he’s been trying to calm her down the whole time.’ The plane then appears to touch down on the airport runway, as it visibly shakes before lights and other vehicles are then seen outside the window behind the distraught woman. The man’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her, as she points and yells ‘don’t f**king touch me’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to God for cursing. She then goes right back into repeating ‘God you’re my savior and fast and loud as she can. Clearly distraught: The crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant . Right as she appears to run out of steam, finally quieting down, Mr Stanley explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman doesn’t make a run for the plane’s door. ‘If she tries to go back, we’re going to block her,’ Mr Stanley said as the woman’s meltdown caught a second wind. Though not as loud and fast as before, the mantra is repeated over and over. It is not clear what the woman’s ultimate fate was, she has not been publicly identified. Then, like a voice from the heavens, an automated message advised passengers to ‘remain in their seats’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate. Salvation had finally come for the passengers, the end of their hellish flight.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Rather than a bagged lunch, a Pennsylvania first-grader brought bags of heroin into school -- giving some to at least one classmate before teachers caught him with a pocket full of drugs, authorities say. Two days later, the boy's 56-year-old grandmother was arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of children and drug offenses for allegedly losing track of the heroin while babysitting, according to a local district attorney's office. Chester County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Tom Hogan expressed outrage over any child bringing a drug as potent as heroin into an elementary school. He also lashed out at the boy's school district for not doing more to inform parents as well as authorities, including his office. \"Any exposure to heroin for a young child is likely to result in death,\" Hogan said in a statement released Monday. \"The (grandmother) is lucky that she was not responsible for the death of her own grandson or somebody else's child.\" According to a criminal complaint detailed by Hogan's office, Pauline Bilinski-Munion was babysitting her grandson and a 1-year-old baby last Thursday at a residence in Modena, Pennsylvania. Bilinski-Munion had \"brought heroin into the house and lost track of it,\" according to the district attorney's office, which referred to her as \"a known heroin user.\" The next day, the 7-year-old brought several bags of heroin with him into Caln Elementary School. Teachers overheard the child talking about the bags, and later found nine bags of what proved to be heroin -- with each bag stamped, \"Victoria's Secret\" -- in the boy's pants pocket, the prosecutor's office said. The child initially claimed he found the heroin in the school yard, only to later admit he'd gotten them from home. The drugs were then handed over to the Coatesville Area School District Police. Another child's mother later claimed that she'd found an additional bag of heroin, with the same \"Victoria's Secret\" wording, on her 7-year-old as they were walking late Friday afternoon in a nearby mall, authorities said. What happened next is a matter of dispute. The school district didn't respond to repeated CNN calls for comment. But CNN affiliate KYW reported that, in a statement, the district \"immediately contacted Caln Township, Coatesville city and (the) South Coatesville Police Departments.\" Yet Hogan faulted the school system for what he characterized as its \"late and vague notification to parents about a 'dangerous and illegal' substance,\" and failing to alert his office, which didn't start investigating until hearing about the story in the media on Saturday. \"The school district didn't call 911, didn't call the DA's office, did not freeze all the kids in place, they did not call in emergency personnel to check all the kids to make sure they were OK,\" he told KYW. \"They did not check to see if there was heroin anywhere else around.\" Following her arrest Sunday, Bilinski-Munion was charged and held with bail set at $25,000. Efforts by CNN to reach her relatives have been unsuccessful, and it wasn't immediately known who is representing her in court. Authorities: Drug ring targeting top suburban Philly schools busted .

        "document": "(CNN) -- More than 700 infants and 40 health care workers have been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at a hospital in El Paso, Texas, according to the city's Department of Public Health. Health officials are not yet saying if any of the people exposed have tested positive for the disease. An employee at Providence Memorial Hospital in El Paso came to work with an active case of TB some time between September 2013 and August 2014. He or she worked with infants in the nursery and in the post-partum unit at the hospital, the health department says. The hospital has identified 706 infants and 43 workers who were exposed to the disease during that time period. The family of each patient was sent a certified letter and is being contacted via telephone with instructions on how to get tested for TB. Any necessary follow-up care will be provided free of charge by the health department and the hospital. The infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment, the owner of the hospital, Sierra Providence Health Network, said in a statement. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing, chest pain and difficulty breathing, according to the Mayo Clinic. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what's called latent TB, where the bacteria remain dormant and don't cause symptoms. \"Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB,\" the City of El Paso's Department of Public Health said in a statement. \"That is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed, screen them, and provide treatment.\" The bacteria that cause TB spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, but it's not a highly contagious disease; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Only active TB can be spread. The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital \"for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety,\" said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations. Investigators \"found serious deficiencies in the areas of infection control, patient rights and governing body.\" The Center for Medicare Services has placed the hospital on a termination track, said David Wright, deputy regional administrator for CMS in Dallas. He said CMS is giving the hospital until October 11 to identify policy changes that need to happen to ensure something like this won't happen again. If the hospital fails to do so, its Medicaid and Medicare funding will be cut off. \"This is one of the largest TB exposure investigations we've ever been involved in, and it involves infants, so it is particularly sensitive,\" Williams said. \"Babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life-threatening forms of TB.\" Patients with TB must take antibiotics for six to nine months. Some strains of TB are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them more dangerous. Without treatment, TB can be fatal, the Mayo Clinic says. There is one vaccine for TB -- Bacille Calmette-Guerin, known as BCG -- that is not widely used in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; it is given more often to children in countries where TB is common. There were 9,582 recorded cases of TB in the United States last year. In October, health officials identified 140 infants who may have been exposed to tuberculosis in a similar incident at a hospital in Nevada. CNN's Matthew Stucker contributed to this story.",

The suspects, who police say are local farmers, were arrested yesterday and have been charged with gang rape. The attack comes just three months after the gang rape and fatal beating of a student in Delhi that sparked protests across India. Campaigners said women in the country are becoming more vulnerable as 'the men have gone totally berserk.' Scroll down for video .

Police said all six suspects are aged between 20 and 25 and belong to a local tribe. They have been remanded in custody and are due back in court tomorrow. The Swiss couple told police that the woman was raped by seven or eight men, but that it was dark and they could not be . sure of the exact number. They said the man was beaten and tied to a tree while his wife was sexually assaulted. It is the latest in a string of violent sex attacks in India that has shocked the subcontinent.

Research think tank said 127 cases of rape have been registered in Delhi since the fatal assault on the student. She told The Telegraph: 'It is absolutely shocking and speaks volumes on how Indian society is . treating women. 'The men have gone totally berserk. We're feeling . frustrated and in despair. What must we do to change their mentality?' The attack on the Swiss couple has . also highlighted concerns about the rise in attacks on foreign women and . those out with husbands or male friends. The husband and wife had set up camp at a village near Datia town, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, when up to eight men burst into their tent.

But police estimate only four out of 10 rapes are reported, largely due . to victims' fear of being shamed by their families and communities. Last . month, the Swiss government issued a travel notice for India that . included a warning about 'increasing numbers of rapes and other sexual . offenses' in the South Asian nation. The violent attack comes mere months after a horrifying attack on a young woman in the Indian capital. The couple had been cycling from Orchha when they were brutally attacked, with eight men 'gang-raping' the Swiss woman in front of her husband . The Swiss tourist has been taken to hospital after she was violently assaulted in Madhya Pradesh, India . India has seen a wave of violent sex attacks that have swept the subcontinent . Five . men and a juvenile are awaiting trial for the sickening gang rape and . attack the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist in Delhi in December last . year. The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India. One of the accused is dead after he was found hanging in his cell. Police allege the six attacked the woman and her male companion on the bus as the couple returned home after watching Life Of Pi on December 16. The woman was repeatedly raped and tortured with a metal bar. The couple were also severely beaten before being thrown onto a road. The woman died of internal injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks later. In January a woman was travelling to her in-laws' home in Punjab when she was allegedly snatched and driven to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city. Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old. They dumped her near her in-laws' village the next morning where she told relatives of her ordeal, police said. Six men were arrested and a seventh was on the run from police, officers said. A 14-year-old schoolgirl was put on life support in hospital after being brutally gang-raped in rural India in late January. Police had failed to make any arrests since the horrific attack in the Jalandhar district of Punjab ten days after the attack. An Indian boy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a security guard who allegedly told the child off for trying to rape an 11-year-old girl. The boy, who has not been named, was arrested in Kalyan, in the outskirts of Mumbai, on suspicion of murder and molestation. The child is accused of dragging a girl who lives near him onto the terrace of his home and trying to rape her, reported NDTV. However, she managed to raise the alarm and escape. Security guard Haji Abdul Jabbar Shaikh then publically warned the boy at a community meeting but he was attacked by six people on Friday as he was walking home. Shahenaj Shaikh, the victim's mother, told NDTV: 'He protects everybody. 'He has done something good. He looked out for the girl, took care of her respect and became a martyr.' She said her son was so badly beaten he could not stand or speak and local media said four of his fingers were chopped off during the attack. As well as the child, police have arrested another man who is accused of murder.",

        "document": "Former N-Dubz singer Dappy leaves Guildford Crown Court today after he avoided jail despite assaulting a man while serving a suspended prison sentence . Former N-Dubz singer Dappy has been spared jailed and walked free from court despite assaulting a man in a nightclub while serving a suspended prison sentence. The 27-year-old prayed and thanked the judge as his sentence was read out and he learned that instead of prison, he would be subject to a curfew with an electronic tag. The rapper, who was tried under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, was found guilty in September of punching a football coach on the dancefloor of the Evissa nightclub in Reading, Berkshire. Judge Neil Stewart told the sentencing hearing at Guildford Crown Court that he would give the troubled star a chance, taking his responsibilities to his two children and his remorse into account. He decided not to activate his suspended jail sentence when sentencing him for the nightclub assault. Instead the judge handed him a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between the hours of 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation. The singer was in court today for breaching a six-month suspended jail term by getting into a dancefloor brawl over a girl which left the coach with a bleeding nose. The judge told the star: 'You have a thread of violence throughout, not at the high level, but it continues. 'You plainly have a temper. No doubt you have attracted unwelcome attention on a number of occasions and that takes a toll. 'That doesn't justify the sort of reaction characterised by these offences.' The star, dressed in black trousers, a white shirt and black jumper with brown Louis Vuitton trainers and a red poppy, had his hands in a prayer position as he sat in the dock awaiting his sentence. He had arrived with a large holdall ready for a custodial sentence and looked desperate, with his head in his hands, as the prosecution ran through guidelines for sentencing. Waving at his friends and supporters in the court, he mouthed ‘See ya,’ - before he discovered he would walk free. The court heard that the start of Dappy’s trial was delayed at the beginning of the year because he was in the Celebrity Big Brother house. Scroll down for video . The rapper was flanked by minders as he walked free. He instead was made the subject of a curfew with an electronic tag . Jon Harrison, defending, said the rapper was struggling financially, having put his house up for sale to pay large tax debts he had run up. Mr Harrison said Dappy had 'underlying issues' and wanted to 'address the root cause of his bad reactions to other people,' and would welcome having a curfew with an electronic tag to keep him out of clubs. The singer has been seeing a psychiatrist, the court heard, who said the death of Dappy’s father had had a big impact on him. Dappy was found guilty in September of punching football coach Devonn Reid at the club in a fight over a girl. Outside the court Dappy told reporters that it felt amazing after he escaped jail and said it was the start of a 'brand new me' A district judge sitting at Reading Magistrates’ Court previously heard that a fight broke out on the dancefloor of Evissa nightclub last October because Dappy, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, began chatting to a man’s girlfriend and female friend. Mr Reid was out celebrating his 21st birthday at the club in Reading, when he asked the rapper to stop talking to the women. He said that the star 'popped my nose.' Dappy denied the attack, claiming he had felt threatened by a 'group of six or seven big boys' at the bar and said he’d been pulled away by a bouncer before a punch was thrown. Earlier in the day, Dappy arrived at Guildford Crown Court dressed in black trousers, a white shirt and black jumper with brown Louis Vuitton trainers and a red poppy . Sentencing for the nightclub attack was adjourned at Reading Magistrates’ Court last month when District Judge Davinder Lachhar decided the matter should be dealt with at Guildford Crown Court. She said this was because his latest conviction put him in breach of a six-month suspended sentence handed down for a previous affray and assault, which could now be activated. His six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months was for affray and assault at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey, in February 2012. Dappy spat at two teenagers, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, both aged 19, leading to a fight in which three men were seriously injured. The rapper was caught on CCTV slapping a man in a nightclub in Chelmsford in Essex earlier this year . The rapper and the Celebrity Big Brother star was fined £800 for the attack . The rapper and Celebrity Big Brother star was also fined £800 earlier this year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. Leaving court today and flanked by his minders, Dappy told waiting reporters: 'I feel amazing. It’s a brand new me.' As part of his sentence the rapper must take part in the Thinking Skills Programme for offenders. The group programme helps people work on their self-control and problem-solving skills in order to curb negative behaviour.",

        "document": "A structure in the heart of Mongolia’s Gobi Desert – lost for a thousand years and marked on maps as ‘The Wall of Genghis Khan’ – has been revealed as still standing and part of the Great Wall. British researcher William Lindesay, aided by Google Earth, GPS and several other experts, found the new section last Autumn in Ömnögovi Province, a sensitive region 25 miles north of the China-Mongolian border. The Great Wall of China is in fact many different structures built over hundreds of years along different routes by various dynasties - this find is the first time a section has been discovered outside China. Remarkable: This part of the newly discovered Wall was constructed from earth and branches and built in 115 B.C . High life: Here the Wall is routed up and over an ancient volcanic cone and is composed of black blocks of basalt . ‘We followed the Wall there for about . 100 kilometres (60 miles), parallel to Mongolia’s southern border with . China and made some unexpected discoveries in terms of both the Wall’s . condition and its probable age,’ said Lindesay, who was joined on the . expedition by China-Mongolia border region expert Dr.Tjalling Halbertsma . and Mongolian geographer and desert specialist Professor Baasan . Tudevin. ‘In one location we found the Wall preserved to a height of around 2.5 metres (eight feet) and made up of earth and branches of a desert shrub called saksaul.’ In another location about 15 miles away the team discovered that the same Wall detoured off its flat and straight course and went up and over an ancient volcanic cone. No . one knows for certain how long the Wall actually is, because it’s not . one structure, but many, built by different dynasties, which follow . different routes. However, Lindesay believes there’s well over 30,000miles of Wall altogether. Some parts of the Wall stand 26-feet high. In places the Wall strides across mountains 3,200-feet above sea level. The Ming dynasty (14th to 17th century) is responsible for building much of what exists today, which measures over 4,000 miles. ‘Going over the mountain it was constructed from black blocks of basalt and stands around 1.5 metres (five feet) high as a prominent landscape feature,’ said Lindesay, who is one of the world’s leading authorities on the Wall, having spent 25 years studying it. He believes that of all the examples of the Wall of Genghis Khan in Mongolia, these are in the best condition. He said: ‘Previously, researchers have seen parts of the so-called Wall of Genghis Khan in different regions of Mongolia where it was found only to exist as a mere mound, barely higher than its surroundings,’ he explained. ‘We found a real Wall here, thanks to Google Earth and Professor Baasan’s navigation of our vehicles across 150 km (93 miles) of desert devoid of human activity right to our target. ‘We “followed” the Wall as a faint line on Google Earth across our computer screens for vast distances and were encouraged by a few stretches that showed dark shadows, which indicated the possibility of the Wall standing higher.’ Despite the name assigned to this part of the Wall, Lindesay doesn’t believe that Genghis Khan was actually responsible for building it. Wild life: Gazelle tracks beside the Wall of Genghis Khan . Sketch map of Mongolia showing the various Walls of Genghis Khan . He said: ‘Genghis Khan was a conquerer, not a defender, and it seems his name is given as a “brand name” to various things in Mongolia - so we believe it’s just an honorific name on the Wall.’ Its history, is not straightforward. He said: ‘The Wall of Genghis Khan in Ömnogovi appears to be a missing piece of the Han Dynasty Great Wall which was routed through the heart of the Gobi around 115 B.C. If we look at maps and Google Earth, it’s pretty clear that the Wall on either side of the border was in fact the same structure - the Han Great Wall - in ancient times. Tourist attraction: The Great Wall of China in the Huairou District of Beijing . The Ming Dynasty Great Wall of China: This is the structure that tourists visit most often today that you'll see on postcards . The Han Dynasty Great Wall structures, which were built between 206BC and 220 AD . ‘Now it’s a remnant of the Great Wall marooned outside China.’ Radiocarbon dating, however, revealed that some of the wall must have been rebuilt at various times. ‘Sample testing on three pieces carried out in the U.S. proved that the saksaul branches from the Wall were cut during the 12th century - a fact that suggests it was reconstructed at that time - by a later dynasty,’ saidLindesay. Full results of Lindesay's find appears in China's March issue of National Geographic Magazine.",

A pub tribute singer is being sued by the Bat Out of Hell star Meat Loaf for £64,000 claiming he's an 'online imposter'. Dean Torkington, 50, from Burnley, Lancashire, has received a $100,000 writ (£64,000) from the US rocker, which accuses him of being a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'. The legal action, launched in Los Angeles, California, centres on Mr Torkington’s website www.meatloaf.org. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Writ: Dean Torkington, 49, from Burnley, Lancashire, performing left in 2002, has received a $100,000 writ (£65,000) from the US rocker Meat Loaf, right, accusing him of being a 'cybersquatter and online imposter' Full-time performer Mr Torkingon, a divorcee, has been a Meatloaf tribute act since 1996 and . performs at pubs and clubs across the UK. He claims to have had the . www.meatloaf.org domain name for 12 years. Meat Loaf, 65, has the website www.meatloaf.net. He is a huge fan of the star - famed for . his 1981 hit Dead Ringer For Love - and has even met him backstage at . one of the singer's gigs in Liverpool. A writ issued by LA law firm . Lavely & Singer, using Meat Loaf’s real name Michael Aday, names Mr . Torkington as a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'. The writ claims Mr Torkington has 'commercially . exploited the internet top-level domain name MeatLoaf.org to capitalise . on the artist’s celebrity'. It goes on to claim Mr Torkington is 'liable for substantial damages, . including statutory damages of up to $100,000 for your cybersquatting'. Cybersquatting means using a domain name . in bad faith where the user is trying to profit from the goodwill of a . trademark belonging to someone else. On his website Mr Torkington, who goes under . the name 'To Hell and Back' and whose shows feature a real motorbike . and big artwork back drops, state: 'You simply won't find a more . accurate portrayal of the Rock God Meat Loaf anywhere else.' Weight loss: Mr Torkington says he's shed 11 stone in the last two years and he is no longer a 'dead ringer' The writ, launched in California, claims Mr Torkington (pictured left as Meat Loaf and right off stage) is 'liable for substantial damages' and he claims the dispute has led to the one-time devoted fan diversifying his act . Multi-million selling artist Meat Loaf is . famous for hits Bat Out Of Hell, Dead Ringer For Love and I’d Do . Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That). Mr Torkington, who has toured with his show To Hell And Back: (A Tribute To Meatloaf) for the past 16 years, said he was shocked at claims. He said the dispute has led to the one-time devoted fan diversifying his act. His Legends of Rock show now includes tributes to Elton John, Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi. Mr Torkington also says the fact that he’s shed 11 stone in the last two years means he could no longer be considered a 'dead ringer'. Action: A screen grab from Dean Torkington's promotional website which is at the centre of the legal action . Controversy: Mr Torkington says he's used the domain name since 2000 and makes clear it's a tribute act . He said: 'Earlier this month I received a copy of the lawsuit posted to my home and emailed. I have every intention of defending this to protect my good name and will not be bullied in this way. 'I really don’t see what his gripe is or legally where he is coming from, I am not guilty of cyber squatting or passing myself off as him.' Mr Torkington travels to gigs in a van adorned with Meat Loaf images. He said he is now trying to re-launch his career with the new show after shedding around 11 stone since 2010. Mr Torkington said that this is not the . first time that Meatloaf has tried to sue him - in 2003 he claimed the . singer dragged him back stage at his concert in Liverpool and told him . to get rid of his van which has Bat Out Of Hell album artwork on the . side. He said he also offered Meat Loaf his domain name for £8,000 - but was offered £1,300. Mr Torkington, who lives alone, said: 'I'm seeing my barrister . because there's a legal term that states if he knew about me and has . done nothing before he cannot complain later on.' Re-launch: Mr Torkington, pictured, is trying to re-launch his career with a new show after shedding 11 stone . Dead ringer? Mr Torkington as Meat Loaf, left, and singer Meat Loaf pictured on stage in 2007 . Mr Torkington added: 'I have been a . Meatloaf tribute performer since 1996. I used to be an Elton John . performer before that but put on quite a bit of weight so decided to . become Meatloaf. 'I would emulate him as best I could. I . have a full stage set with a motorbike and a big picture of the album . cover Bat Out Of Hell 2 at the back.' He added: 'We have not got on for a long time. He said that he wanted my website www.Meatloaf.org. He's never made it easy for me. 'Once I paid £400 on VIP tickets to see . Meat Loaf at Liverpool Docks. He came in his big tour bus and I came in . my van with the Bat out of Hell artwork on the side. 'I was on the front row and we were due . to meet the band after the show. During one of the songs I got a tap on . my shoulder and this guy tells me that Meat Loaf wanted to meet me after . the show. 'I went back stage and I had him and his . manager having a go at me. He said that he wanted to get all the . pictures off the side of my van and also he wanted my website address. 'I told him that he was not having my . website but shortly after that his YouTube channel complained about my . YouTube videos of my show and I had to take mine down. 'I have taken this show all over the . country and promoted him well in all these years. I have done charity . gigs too. But when the person that you are portraying is making your . life hell it makes you question whether you still want to be like them. 'I just wanted him to say that he . thought that it was good but he never has. My webpage has always said . that I am a tribute act. I have never tried to say that I am Meat Loaf . himself. 'I've gone back to doing Elton John . tribute acts more now as a result of all this. It's less hassle than . being a Meatloaf tribute act any day.' Mr Torkington, whose next show is at the Crown Paints Social Club, Darwen on Saturday, July 28, added: 'There are no court dates set and I believe they have to serve me the writ in person for that. 'It wouldn’t surprise me if they did it while I was on stage in Darwen.'",

A university student tore her windpipe and put her life at risk when she drank so much that she spent 24 hours being sick. Megan Thomason, 21, spent six days in hospital with serious complications from the injury after taking advantage of cheap drinks promotions in bars. Doctors feared she could suffocate or develop blood poisoning, Miss Thomason said, adding that she ‘nearly died’. Her neck and face swelled up and her bulging cheeks made her ‘look like a hamster’. Megan Thomason, 21, was admitted to hospital after vomiting for 24 hours straight following a heavy night out . Miss Thomason, who is studying business and management at Hull University, has said she will give up alcohol and warned of the dangers of binge drinking. She accepted responsibility for making herself seriously ill, but added that cheap drinks deals offered by bars and clubs pose a big health risk to young people. She said: ‘We automatically think if it’s cheaper we can afford to drink more and that’s not good. ‘People can have ten or 20 drinks a night. 'You don’t realise what one night out could do. It was the worst experience of my whole life. People say they get hung over but I nearly died.’ Sticking to orange juice from now on: Miss Thomason pictured on a recent night out (left) has given up drinking after her ordeal in June last year . Miss Thomason went on a night out . with friends in York in June and downed three triple vodka and cokes . that cost only £2.89 each, thanks to a special offer. The student from Barlby, North Yorkshire, said: ‘Being drunk is classed as normal and I gave in to peer pressure. ‘I’d had three drinks but because they were triples it was actually the equivalent of nine drinks and you don’t think of that at the time.’ The group went to two more bars, where Miss Thomason had more vodka-based drinks before going to a friend’s house. Her stepfather picked her up early the next morning and she started a 24-hour period of vomiting and retching, which caused damage to her throat. Hospitalised: Megan pictured in hospital recovering from her ordeal . She was prescribed anti-nausea medication, but when it did not improve her condition she was taken to hospital. Doctors . noticed her facial swelling and discovered her windpipe was torn. The . injury resulted in a condition known as subcutaneous emphysema, in which . air becomes trapped in a layer of skin. Megan Thomason takes responsibility for her ordeal but thinks cheap drinks promotions are partly to blame for luring skint students in . ‘They realised my face had blown up. My cheeks looked a bit like a hamster with all the food in them,’ she said. ‘Basically it felt like bubble wrap inside my cheeks and my mouth and chest.’ 'She . spent the next six days in hospital, not eating or drinking, as her . throat healed. She added: ‘It is only now I realise just how serious it . was. ‘If I had eaten I could have got blood poisoning from the food or I could have choked if it had gone into my lungs. ‘It was just one night out for a few drinks and it left me in hospital for a week – I could have died.’ Miss Thomason has now been told that her body lacks the enzymes needed to break down alcohol properly. Her mother Justine Bean, 45, an administrator, and site supervisor stepfather Gary Bean, 48, have urged her not to drink again. Professor Paul Wallace, the chief medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: ‘The main danger of drinking alcoholic drinks is the alcohol itself and its effect on your brain and your body. ‘It doesn’t much matter whether you drink it in wine, beer, spirits or anything else – the alcohol is what causes the effect on your brain and your body.

A few years ago, it would have been very unusual to find them gracing the fruit bowl. But they are now the fastest-selling exotic fruit in Britain. Sales of persimmons overtook kiwi fruit, mangos and avocados in the build up to Christmas, according to industry experts. More than four million of the fruit, which resemble bright orange tomatoes, were sold in British supermarkets in 2012 – double the number sold the previous year. Exotic: Persimmons have now overtaken fruits such as mangos and kiwis in Britain's supermarkets . Experts put the success of persimmons down to their health benefits. They are rich in vitamins A and C, contain calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium and have twice as much fibre per 100g than an apple. And, perhaps most importantly at the start of the new year, research has shown persimmons help lower the density of alcohol in the blood which, along with the sweetness, makes them a great hangover cure. At around 50p each, they are also cheaper than most exotic fruits. Persimmons, which are mainly grown in China and Japan, can be eaten with the skin on without special preparation and can be used in salads, with chicken, lamb or pork, or to make desserts. Dean Hayden, exotic fruit buyer for Asda, said: ‘The market for persimmon is growing at a huge rate. Persimmon is a very accessible fruit. Out of favour: Kiwi fruit has falling down the pecking order in terms of popularity among British shoppers . 'It’s consistently sweet, you can eat it hard like an apple or soft like a peach and importantly you waste nothing, not even the skin, which is edible. ‘Customers get great satisfaction from their purchase and repeat sales tell us it’s a favourite and will continue surprising many more customers to come. ‘Several years ago the produce industry were saying persimmon would be the new kiwi fruit. ‘They were right but it’s taken until now for us to develop; we now have a better understanding and control of the processes required to deliver this great value and versatile fruit that we see today, better late than never.’",

        "document": "From flapper dresses and fringes to feathers and finger curls, the 1920s was an era of opulence and post-war fashion fun.

        "document": "By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 06:34 EST, 23 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 23 April 2012 . A gift of balloons. That, prosecutors contend, is what sent Jennifer Hudson's then brother-in-law into such a jealous rage that he shot dead her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in a horrific act of vindictiveness in the home where the Hollywood star grew up. A prosecutor is expected to tell jurors that during opening statements at the trial of William Balfour - charged with three counts of first-degree murder over the October 24, 2008 slayings that generated nationwide headlines because of Hudson's fame. Tragic: Jennifer Hudson holding her Oscar with her mother other Darnell Hudson Donerson, 57, who was found dead at the family's home in Chicago in 2008 . The estranged husband of Hudson's . sister, Balfour believed the balloons he saw at the Hudson home came . from Julia Hudson's new boyfriend; driving away for her job as a school . bus driver, she glimpsed Balfour in her mirror still lingering outside, . prosecutors have said. They say Balfour went back inside the three-story house around 9am and used a .45-caliber handgun to kill Hudson's mother, 57-year-old Darnell Hudson Donerson, in the living room - then shot her 29-year-old brother, Jason Hudson, twice in the head as he lay in bed. Trial: William Balfour is on trial accused of murdering Jennifer Hudson's mother Darnell Donerson, older brother Jason and nephew Julian King . He allegedly drove off in Jason Hudson's SUV with Julia Hudson's son, Julian King, inside. Authorities say he shot the boy nicknamed Juice Box in the head as he lay behind a front seat. His body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after a three-day search. There are no known witnesses to the slayings, and it's unclear what physical evidence exists, be it fingerprints or DNA. Prosecutors say gunshot residue was found on the steering wheel of Balfour's car. But the defense says that and other evidence is circumstantial. Close ties: Jennifer Hudson offered $100,000 for the safe return of her nephew Julian King, seven (left) A gun, which Balfour allegedly stole months before from Hudson's brother, was recovered in a lot near where the SUV was found and will be presented as the murder weapon. Establishing motive may pose less of a challenge. A high-school dropout and one-time Gangster Disciple known by the gang name 'Flex', Balfour allegedly threatened to kill the Hudson family at least two dozen times, starting earlier in 2008 when he moved out of the house, lead prosecutor James McKay has said. Murder trial: William Balfour is the estranged husband of Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia. He is accused of killing her mother, brother and nephew four years ago . A day before the killings, on Julia Hudson's birthday, McKay says, Balfour told her, 'If you ever leave me, I'm going to kill you, but I'm going to kill your family first.' She didn't take him seriously, McKay said, because Balfour hadn't acted on the threats before. Court records indicate the now 34-year-old Julia Hudson's divorce from Balfour was finalized last year. If convicted of at least two of the murder counts, the 30-year-old Balfour, on parole at the time of the killings after serving nearly seven years for attempted murder and vehicular hijacking, would face a mandatory life sentence. Harrowing: Jennifer Hudson poses with her Oscar in 2008 and brother-in-law William Balfour. She could testify at his murder trial over the shootings of her mother, brother and nephew . Jennifer Hudson's name is among 300 on a list of potential witnesses, though it's not certain she will testify. The 2004 American Idol finalist and 2007 Oscar winner for her role in Dreamgirls is expected to attend each day of testimony, which could last up to a month. Judge Charles Burns has instructed jurors to set aside any sympathy for Hudson and decide a verdict strictly according to testimony. The panelists include a teacher, a trucker and two people who have had close relatives murdered. Proceedings: William Balfour's murder trial started this week at the Cook County courthouse in Chicago . Prosecutors have said Balfour claimed he wasn't near the Hudson home at the time of the killing, but they are expected to introduce cellphone records that allegedly prove he was in the area when two teenage girls who live nearby heard gunshots. The witnesses didn't immediately report the shots to police because the sound of gunfire isn't uncommon in the impoverished, crime-ridden Englewood neighbourhood, according to court filings. Troubled relationship: Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia with her estranged husband William Balfour who is standing trial for murdering her relatives . At a time when cities across the country have seen the number of homicides fall, sometimes dramatically, Chicago's jumped by a whopping 60 per cent the first three months of the year, and Englewood's violence was a big reason why. Since he took office last May, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has used the word 'Englewood' as almost shorthand for gangs, guns and the dangers facing the city's children. The deteriorating neighborhood has presented him with one of his biggest challenges, becoming a focus for his promise to deploy more police officers to the street while cracking down on Englewood's gangs. Violence: The boarded up former home of Jennifer Hudson and her family in Englewood, Chicago. There are thousands of boarded-up buildings in the city's most notorious neighbourhood . There are a host of reasons for Englewood's downward spiral. But they mostly boil down to an exodus of families from an area that was predominantly single-family homes, resulting in an explosion in the number of abandoned buildings, and an influx of gang members.Home to 100,000 residents in 1960, Englewood's population has dwindled. It had dropped to about 40,000 in 2000 and to 30,000 just 10 years later.Part of the reason is that families moved out to safer places and others lost their homes when they lost jobs during the recession.According to the police department, there are more than 4,100 abandoned buildings in Englewood, nearly 600 of them vacated in just the last 15 months. Neighbour: Englewood resident Antie Moore at the former home of Jennifer Hudson and her family in the troubled Chicago neighbourhood .",

        "document": "It is estimated that around one in four couples around the world have trouble conceiving. For a small proportion of them, In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a technology that can restore the dream of parenthood. IVF is the fertilization of an egg by sperm outside the body, where it is cultivated in a lab environment, and if an embryo results it is implanted into the mother's womb. Now the chances of IVF treatment being successful are being boosted by a machine called the Embryoscope. A record number of babies are being born through IVF -- with over 60,000 IVF babies born in the United States alone in 2012. But since the inception of IVF in the 1970s, monitoring embryos has been a difficulty. In order to examine them, the embryologist must remove them from the safe environment of the incubator and expose them to environmental hazards such as temperature changes and contaminants. Embryos are removed and examined just once a day, which limits the information available to embryologists, as well as the chances of picking the embryo with the best chance of delivering a viable pregnancy. Embryo development . But these longstanding issues are being addressed by the Embryoscope. The device combines an incubator that maintains perfect conditions, with a tiny camera that takes photos every 10-15 minutes -- creating a time-lapse video of the embryo's development. This removes the need to expose the embryo to the outside atmosphere, and provides embryologists with far greater information with which to make decisions. \"I think this is the most exciting breakthrough since IVF started,\" says Dr. Simon Fishel, managing director of the UK's CARE Fertility, responsible for the first Embryoscope baby born in the UK, in 2012 (as well as the first ever IVF baby back in 1978). \"The information that we are gathering with the Embryoscope with the time-lapse is far superior,\" he says. \"We have much, much more information on which to base the crucial decision as to which embryo is the one to transfer back to the patient.\" Embryos that show early abnormalities can be immediately ruled out, and learning algorithms have been created that recognize positive or negative patterns at key development points thereafter -- meaning patients can be implanted with embryos that have an optimal chance of success. \"We have a predictive scale (for evaluating) the likelihood of an embryo to give the best chance of a live birth,\" says Fishel. \"It's a complex procedure and it uses very complex technology and some mathematics. But using this whole process, it really changes the way the embryologists work in the lab. And I think it's changing the face of how we do IVF, in fact.\" Improving the odds . The extra information is particularly beneficial for patients with the lowest chances of pregnancy -- such as older women, or those with reduced egg counts. CARE estimates its use of the Embryoscope and algorithms broadly increases the chance of a pregnancy by around 20%. \"The images also allow you a higher level of assurance to pick an embryo with the highest chance of being genetically normal,\" says Dr. Jason Barritt, lab director at the ART Reproductive Center, in California. The technology can also provide insights into early-stage development beyond the need to conceive. A recent Spanish study conducted with an Embryoscope showed differences in growth patterns between male and female embryos, which could potentially allow gender to be more rapidly determined. Use of the Embryoscope has spread to IVF facilities around the world, but some barriers remain: the vast amount of extra data requires greater resources for analysis, and the technology itself is expensive. But much of IVF is about trying to beat the odds, and as technology progresses, so do the chances of parenthood for couples who can't conceive naturally.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- Republicans are consoling themselves with the claim that President Barack Obama didn't win a mandate Tuesday night, even if he did renew his White House lease for another four years. They are fooling themselves, however, if they think the 2012 election merely ratified the political status quo. More than just a personal victory for Obama, the outcome was an unmistakable defeat for GOP ideology. Disgruntled conservatives, of course, are already dressing Mitt Romney for the part of fall guy. But this is the politics of evasion. Sooner or later, GOP realists will have to reappraise the party's message rather than shoot its messenger. That message was a call for rolling back government. Intoxicated by a potent brew of resurgent libertarian dogma and intense personal animus toward Obama, Republicans vowed to undo his major achievements: health care reform, new rules for financial markets, the regulation of carbon emissions, higher fuel economy standards for autos, and so on. Conservatives also railed against an alleged epidemic of dependency on government; called for deep spending cuts (but no tax hikes) to reduce public deficits; threatened to roll back women's reproductive rights; and took extreme positions on tax, immigration and energy issues that seemed calculated to thwart bipartisan compromise. Such tea party radicalism seemed to work in 2010, amid acute public dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic recovery. But a different electorate -- larger, more moderate and more Democratic -- rejected the conservative vision this time. In effect, the pragmatic center reasserted itself on Tuesday. According to exit polls, a plurality of voters, 41%, were moderates, and they favored Obama by 15 points. In general, voters viewed Obama as more for the middle class and Republicans as tilting toward the interests of the rich. They did not accept Romney's claims that Obama has been an incompetent economic manager; nearly half the voters instead blamed the weak economy on his predecessor. Opinion: Obama's critics, repudiated at last . And for all the GOP's ceaseless demonization of Obamacare, the issue seemed to work in the president's favor. Exit polls say health care registered as the voters' second most important concern (albeit a distant second to the economy and jobs). Obama won massively among these voters, which suggests that Republican promises to kill health care reform may have backfired by spurring greater intensity among its advocates. Some Republicans point hopefully to the fact that the election barely changed the existing composition of political forces in Washington. That's true, but this was an election they could have won. With stubbornly high unemployment and the president's low approval ratings (often below the previously supposed \"can't win\" threshold of 50%), the Republicans had objective reality on their side. Instead, they blew it by indulging in pathological partisanship and ideological hubris. The big question now is whether Republicans will accept the lessons of their defeat or take refuge in the usual alibis. The biggest lesson, of course, is they lost because they picked the wrong candidate -- a Massachusetts moderate who didn't given the country a clear choice between undiluted conservatism and Obama's alleged ultra-liberalism. This electoral math is no better than Romney's budget math. America may list slightly to the center-right, but no party can cede the center and win. What Republicans really need is an analogue to the New Democrat movement of the 1990s -- a determined effort by moderates and pragmatists to reassert control over their party's agenda and electoral strategies. Whether they realize that is another matter: Democrats had to lose four out of five presidential elections between 1968 and 1992 before finally accepting that their message could no longer command electoral majorities. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . Republicans don't have that luxury. Tuesday's results made it blindingly obvious that the GOP's political strategy of relying almost exclusively on white voters already has reached a dead end. As expected, white turnout was 72%, according to exit polls, two points down from 2008, and is projected to be two points lower in 2016. The GOP's bet on a kind of white identity politics -- which dates back to Ronald Reagan's successful 1966 run for governor in California and was ruthlessly perfected by Richard Nixon in 1972 -- is played out. Meanwhile, what the National Journal's Ronald Brownstein calls the Democrats' \"coalition of the ascendant\" is growing by about the same amount every four years. This coalition includes minorities, young voters and women (especially single women), along with highly educated white professionals. As they pore over election returns, expect GOP strategists to look especially ruefully at Latino voters. Obama won them by 71% to 27%, according to exit polls, improving on his 2008 performance. Assuming that Latinos would focus mainly on their economic struggles and ignore the GOP's harshly anti-immigrant stance, proved to be a major miscalculation. A conservative governing philosophy centered on exploiting white voters' sense of cultural dispossession is a formula for political marginalization, if not demographic suicide. Any honest post-mortem of the 2012 election should lead Republican strategists to this inescapable conclusion: It's the ideology, stupid. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Marshall.",
        "summary": "Obama's re-election was an unmistakable defeat for GOP ideology, says Will Marshall .\nTea party radicalism seemed to work in 2010, but not this time, he says .\nAccording to exit polls, a plurality of voters were moderates, says Marshall .\nThe GOP strategy of relying on white voters has reached a dead end, he says .",

        "document": "Isabel Ramsay, executive headteacher of Bandon Hill Primary School is paid more than the Prime Minister . A primary school head teacher is being paid more than £200,000 a year - taking her income above that of the Prime Minister. Isabel Ramsay is paid more than her boss, the chief executive of Sutton Council and is one of the highest paid headteachers in Britain. Her school, Bandon Hill Primary, said she is paid so much because she is executive head teacher and does work throughout London with other schools. But union workers have said they do not believe Mrs Ramsay should be paid so much more than other teachers and she should be focusing on her school rather than working at others. Mrs Ramsay's income was revealed after Sutton council published its core financial statement this year. This revealed she is paid £190,898 in salary, fees and allowances with a further £14,178 in employer's pension contribution, bringing the total to £205,076. The Prime Minister is paid £142,500 and Mrs Ramsey's boss, Niall Bolger received a basic salary of £163,635, with a pension top up of £28,473 bringing his total to £192.108. Mrs Ramsey's salary is determined by the governors at the school, not Sutton Council or the Department of Education. When Sutton Council asked the school to explain Mrs Ramsey's high income they said it covered her work at Bandon Hill as well as that supporting other schools across the country. Bandon Hill Primary School, in Wallington, south west London, is made up of two primary schools and Oak Field, a specialist autistic unit. Each of the three schools have their own headteacher. Nancy Bonney, 82, is the assistant secretary for NUT Sutton. She said: 'Every teacher I have ever met works extremely hard and their best for the children. 'I don't think a head teacher should work at more than one school. Even if you have the best deputy, it is not the same. Governors at Bandon Hill said Mrs Ramsay's salary is due to the work she does with schools across the UK . Mrs Ramsay's pay was revealed in Sutton Council's core financial statements, showing that with her salary and employer pension contributions she earns more than the chief executive of Sutton Council, her boss. 'She must be run off her feet even if she is very well organised. 'I don't know about head teachers being paid so much more than their staff and I don't think one head should be running more than one school.' Mrs Ramsay's salary increased from £172,218 last year, making her one of the highest paid headteachers in the country. A spokesman for the school governors said her pay reflected the fact she was running a 'very large primary school'. He added: 'In addition the Executive Headteacher and other staff from Bandon Hill are currently supporting three other schools, one of which is in London, one in the South East and one in the East of England. As a national leader of education, and as a national support school, the Executive Headteacher and the staff provide a range of interventions, including working directly with other headteachers, to support those schools in accelerating pupil progress and in raising standards of attainment. Mrs Ramsay is one of the highest paid headteachers . In 2010 it was revealed that Mark Elms, 57, of Tidemill Primary School in Lewisham, south-east London, received £248,100. His salary which was due in part to his work on the London Challenge programme, was described as 'extraordinary' and 'exorbitant'at the time. And in May of this year Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in south London, saw his salary and pension increase to a total of £229,138. He was knighted in last year's birthday honours. Ric Adams, chairman of Bandon Hill Primary School's governors, said: 'The salary level of all staff in Bandon Hill, including the executive head teacher, is determined by the school's governing body. 'The salary figure currently being attributed to the executive head teacher is not an accurate reflection of the actual salary paid by Bandon Hill Primary School. 'Bandon Hill is a designated national support school and the executive head teacher is a national leader of education. 'Therefore the remuneration level quoted includes both pension contributions as per requirements and also reflects the work which the executive head teacher and the school do in supporting a number of other schools in several local authorities across the country.' A spokesman for Sutton Council said neither they or the Department of Education had been approached by the school's governors about Mrs Ramsey's level of remuneration.. He said: 'The level of pay for school staff is decided by school's governors and not the responsibility of the council. 'We are aware of the salary figure for the head teacher which is much higher than usual. In 2010 it was revealed that Tidemill Primary School headteacher Mark Elms (left) was earning a salary of £248,100 and earlier this year that Sir Greg Martin (right) was receiving an income of £229,138 . 'We asked the governing body to explain the package and have been told it covers school salary plus remuneration for work done at schools in other local authorities.' Mrs Ramsay has been at the school for more than 20 years according to her LinkedIn profile. In its last Ofsted inspection in 2008 the then Bandon Hill Primary School achieved an outstanding rating.",

        "document": "By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 00:53 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 8 August 2013 . Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education . Senior Tory MPs demanded a return of grammar schools in England yesterday after the Conservatives in Wales announced that they will bring them back if they win the next Assembly election. Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education where there are currently no grammar schools. And he said existing selective schools should be allowed to expand further. There are no remaining grammar schools in Wales and only 164 in England. David Cameron has angered many of his backbenchers by refusing to overturn a ban introduced by Labour on new grammar schools. But in a challenge to the leadership, Welsh Tories threw down the gauntlet by proposing plans for children to undergo academic selection at 14 - rather than the old 11 plus - choosing whether to continue with rigorous academic subjects or concentrate on technical or practical courses. Mr Brady, who resigned from the Tory frontbench in 2007 after Mr Cameron said he would not support more Grammar Schools, said his party should do more for parents in England who don’t want to have to pay for selective schools. He told the Mail: ‘I’m delighted to see colleagues in Wales thinking so creatively about ways to improve standards of state education. 'In England Michael Gove has done an enormous amount to increase choice and diversity in state schools. ‘I hope we will also be prepared to look at ways of freeing up schools in areas that don’t currently have grammar schools to introduce academic selection. 'Everybody accepts that selection is necessary at 16 before people go on to sit A-Levels. There’s no reason in principle why selection at 14 shouldn’t be tried. Popular: The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 . ‘In England the government celebrates the success of our existing grammar schools and is happy to allow them to expand or set up annexes in areas which already have grammar schools. 'There is a massive and unfulfilled demand for the rigour of academic selection in other parts of the country where current laws, introduced by Labour, prevent parents having the option of grammar schools in the state sector.’ David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, also voiced support for the plans. He said: ‘Bring back grammar schools! Hope the Tory party in London [is] listening to what we are saying in Wales.’ His colleague Glyn Davies said he ‘loves the UK impact’ of the Welsh announcement. Angela Burns, the Conservative shadow minister for education in Wales, declared: ‘It is time we put the Grammar back into education and Wales has just that perfect opportunity. She said: ‘We could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education, one alongside the other, a dualing that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path.’ The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding. But the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils. The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 - and almost double the historic low of 1986. Over the past 25 years, their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands. There are now more than 161,000 pupils in state-funded selective schools. The next Tory signal on selective education will come when Education Secretary Michael Gove rules this autumn on whether to allow one of two grammar schools in Kent to build a new ‘annexe’ in the Kent town of Sevenoaks, miles from the original schools. A Department for Education spokesman: ‘We have changed the rules so that popular schools, including grammars, can expand in response to parental demand. 'We have received two formal applications from grammar schools in Kent to expand onto the Sevenoaks site. We are currently assessing these applications.’ Under devolution, the Welsh Tories are free to set their own policy independent of Mr Cameron’s party in London. A Conservative Central Office spokesman said: ‘We don’t have an opinion on Welsh education policy because it is a devolved matter.’",

Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago. Despite being one of the biggest games to be released on the console this year, developers have been forced to issue dozens of updates as part of attempts to fix the problems. Scroll down for video . Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago. The main issues surround the 'multiplayer' function of the game . The main issues are said to revolve around the online gaming aspect of Halo, where players can access a multiplayer function to battle against each other. Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which costs about £40, comprises of all the Halo titles which have been released since the original Xbox came out in 2001. The previous titles have been digitally upgraded so they are compatible with the new Xbox One, which costs in the region of £329.99. 343 Industries, the Microsoft-owned developer of Halo, said numerous updates have been released to try and resolve the problems but said ‘far too many’ players remain affected. Today, Bonnie Ross, the founder of 343 industries, issued a heartfelt apology to fans for the issues surrounding the game. In a blog post, she wrote: ‘On Nov 11 we released Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The goal being to create a tribute to Halo fans around the world, and to celebrate the Master Chief’s debut on Xbox One. ‘With the initial release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, however, we have not delivered the experience you deserve. I personally apologise for this on behalf of us all at 343 Industries. Our team is committed to working around the clock until these issues are resolved. ‘While our team works on continual improvements and towards solutions, my commitment to you is that we will take care of all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection. ‘Our primary and continued focus is first on fixing the issues at hand. Once we’ve done that, we will detail how we will make this right with our fans.’ Ms Ross also announced that multiple content updates would be issued over the coming weeks as part of desperate attempts to fix the problems. The collection, which costs about £40, comprises of all the Halo titles which have been released since  2001 . Bonnie Ross, founder of 343 Industries, has personally apologised for the issues and vowed to get them fixed . She said: ‘On the matchmaking front, we have encountered unexpected issues that were not apparent in our internal test environment and that have resulted in a frustrating experience, including long matchmaking times and low session success rates. ‘Within 343 Industries and Xbox, I can assure you that resolving these issues is our #1 priority (sic). ‘We continue to partner with the Xbox platform team to analyse all data to make ongoing server-side adjustments to continually improve the matchmaking experience. ‘We are also preparing additional content updates that will address existing campaign, UI, and other issues to improve the overall experience. ‘With each update we will carefully analyse data to confirm that the improvements we’re seeing internally are also happening with fans at home. ‘Know that we’re trying to be as nimble as possible to put fixes in place. We are planning multiple server-side tweaks and game content updates over the coming weeks.’ She said the next release would come later in the week before adding: ‘Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the delay and for the negative aspects of your experience to date. ‘We’re doing everything in our power to resolve it as quickly as possible.’ Earlier this month, Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox division, took to Twitter to apologise for the issues after receiving a barrage of criticism from fans. He wrote: ‘Sorry about the issues. I know our fans expect more from us. Team is making progress but I know it’s still disappointing.’ However, his tweet was later deleted. Halo: The Master Chief Collection was billed as the ultimate package which would allow players to enjoy all four Halo games on the Xbox One. Players would take on the role of cyborg soldiers and have access to more than 100 multiplayer maps on which their virtual character could battle against others.",

The California-based internet giant has faced stinging criticism for using a complex corporate structure that allows it to route UK sales through Ireland to slash its tax bill. And the scheme appears to have again paid off. Luck has nothing to do with it: Google has managed to slash its UK tax bill to just £20million . Last night it revealed in accounts filed to Companies House that it paid £20.4million in taxes last year – despite admitting earlier this year that it pulls in £3.3billion of revenues in Britain, largely from advertising. But in accounts filed last night Google UK said it made a profit of £70.8million before tax on sales of £642million. These numbers are artificially low because Google officially registers much of its British sales in Ireland, where the headline rate of corporation tax is 12.5 per cent compared with 21 per cent in the UK. And the internet behemoth is then able to slash its bill even further by siphoning cash out of Ireland by paying royalties to another firm based in the tax haven of Bermuda. 'Deeply disappointed': Ed Miliband's on Google's tax-avoidance policy when it came to light last year . Google’s aggressive tax avoidance policy has sparked criticism from campaign groups and politicians including Ed Miliband. The Labour leader last year declared himself ‘deeply disappointed’ that Google, which employs almost 2,000 people in the UK, is able to get away with paying so little tax. Google has defended itself by pointing to its record of employing people in the UK and investing more than £300million in London property. But France has moved to crack down on the company, slapping it with a tax bill of nearly £800million earlier this year after raiding its Paris offices.",

Accidental death: Stuart James Bullas, 57, was crushed to death by his beloved classic car at his factory in Lye, near Birmingham . A company director and motor-racing enthusiast was crushed to death when his prized vintage sports car fell on him as he repaired it. Stuart James Bullas, 57, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, had broken several motor racing  records in amateur competitions with his beloved yellow Austin Healey Sprite Mark 1, which weighed more than half a tonne. Mr Bullas, who was divorced and had no children, was found dead on the shop floor of his family engineering firm BG Bullas Ltd in Lye, near Stourbridge, on April 10. He had been doing some last-minute work on the car, which had appeared on Top Gear and was driven by The Stig, before a race. Black Country coroner Robin Balmain . heard the business owner had apparently used a crane to lift the vehicle . but had not secured it properly on the frame. It fell out of a . cradle, crushing him as he lay on the floor beneath it, while clutching a . ratchet drive. His body was found by his driving partner Robin Johnson and some other friends. He was declared dead at the scene by . paramedics. Motor enthusiast: Mr Bullas was a keen race competitor in his beloved Austin Healey . Mr Johnson, of Kings Norton, who had known Mr Bullas . since he was 15, recalled how he tried in vain to life the car off his friend. Fighting back tears, he said: 'Stuart . must have used the crane to lift the car and it probably slipped off . the loop and fell on him.' Mr Bullas had usually been 'a . stickler for making sure things were properly done', Mr Johnson said, as . he had lost two fingers in a metal press when younger. They had co-owned the car and arranged to meet at the factory on the . day Mr Bullas's body was found, so they could go to Loton Park, near . Shrewsbury, for a race. Another friend Dave Powell described Mr Bullas as being 'careful and fearless'. Mr Bullas's older brother Graham, from Christchurch in Dorset, said: 'He was a lovely person - very generous and considerate and it was summed up at the funeral. There were hundreds of people there.' He added: 'Anybody working on a motor vehicle in the future who reads this sad story must take care to avoid such tragic accidents themselves.' Mr Balmain ruled Mr Bullas died of traumatic asphyxia due to being trapped under a motor vehicle and that it had been an accident. Car lover: The Austin Healey of Mr Bullas appeared on Top Gear driven by The Stig (second left) - with presenters Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson .",

        "document": "(CNN) -- An emperor penguin that lost its way from Antarctica more than two months ago was released back into his native Southern Ocean waters Sunday. \"It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free,\" said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo, where the bird has been recuperating since New Zealanders discovered it in June on a beach north of the capital city. Argilla said the penguin, nicknamed \"Happy Feet\" after the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins, needed \"some gentle encouragement\" to slide down a ramp off the research vessel that transported it back home. \"But once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the boat and all those 'aliens' who have been looking after him for so long,\" Argilla said in a statement posted on the zoo's website. It's unclear why the penguin apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from Antarctica. Argilla said in June that the bird might have gotten lost in a current, or perhaps its internal radar went awry. The bird was found \"exhausted and hungry\" on Peka Peka beach on New Zealand's Kapiti Coast this summer, according to the zoo. It underwent multiple stomach flushes and an endoscopy at the zoo to rid its stomach of sand it ingested while trying to adapt to the foreign environment. \"In Antarctica, they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate,\" Kate Baker, a spokeswoman for the zoo, said in June. It's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice, she said. The penguin left the zoo Monday and spent the past six days on the research vessel in a specially designed crate stocked with ice. A satellite tracker and microchip will now allow fans of the bird to follow his adventures in Antarctica at www.nzemperor.com.",

        "document": "Testifying before Congress on Wednesday, Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, asserted that his agency's massive acquisition of U.S. phone data and the contents of overseas Internet traffic that is provided by American tech companies has helped prevent \"dozens of terrorist events.\" On Thursday, Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. \"Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods,\" the two senators said. Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks. This suggests that the NSA surveillance programs are wide-ranging fishing expeditions with little to show for them. Alexander promised during his congressional testimony that during this coming week more information would be forthcoming about how the NSA surveillance programs have prevented many attacks. A U.S. intelligence document provided to CNN by a congressional source over the weekend asserts that the dragnet of U.S. phone data and Internet information from overseas users \"has contributed to the disruption of dozens of potential terrorist plots here in the homeland and in more than 20 countries around the world.\" The public record, which is quite rich when it comes to jihadist terrorism cases, suggests that the NSA surveillance yielded little of major value to prevent numerous attacks in the United States, but government officials may be able to point to a number of attacks that were averted overseas. That may not do much to dampen down the political firestorm that has gathered around the NSA surveillance programs. After all, these have been justified because they have supposedly helped to keep Americans safe at home. Homegrown jihadist extremists have mounted 42 plots to conduct attacks within the United States since 2001. Of those plots, nine involved an actual terrorist act that was not prevented by any type of government action, such as the failed attempt by Faisal Shahzad to blow up a car bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010. Of the remaining 33 plots, the public record shows that at least 29 were uncovered by traditional law enforcement methods, such as the use of informants, reliance on community tips about suspicious activity and other standard policing practices. Informants have played a critical role in preventing more than half of the plots by homegrown jihadist extremists since the 9/11 attacks, according to New America Foundation data. For instance, a group of Muslims from the Balkans living in southern New Jersey who were virulently opposed to the Iraq War told a government informant in 2007 they were plotting to kill soldiers stationed at the nearby Fort Dix army base. Other investigations have relied on tips to law enforcement. Saudi student Khalid Aldawsari's plot to attack a variety of targets in Texas in 2011, including President George W. Bush's home in Dallas, was foiled when a company reported his attempt to buy chemicals suitable for making explosives. Standard police work has also stopped plots. Kevin Lamar James, a convert to Islam, formed a group dedicated to holy war while he was jailed in California's Folsom Prison during the late 1990s. James' crew planned to attack a U.S. military recruiting station in Los Angeles on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 as well as a synagogue a month later. Members of James' group financed their activities by sticking up gas stations, and their plans only came to light during the course of a routine investigation of a gas station robbery by local police in Torrance, California, who found documents that laid out the group's plans for mayhem. In defending the role of NSA surveillance in his congressional testimony, Alexander pointed to two plots averted by his agency's programs; the plan by Denver resident Najibullah Zazi  to bomb the New York subway system in 2009 and a plot the same year by Chicago resident David Coleman Headley to attack the offices of a Danish newspaper that had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that many Muslims deemed offensive. In the Zazi case, testimony in a Brooklyn court shows that around the eighth anniversary of 9/11, U.S. officials found an e-mail address in Pakistan, believed to be connected to al Qaeda, that was in communication with njbzaz@yahoo.com, an e-mail address in the Denver area. Officials found that Zazi was e-mailing from njbzaz@yahoo.com to get clarification from his handlers in Pakistan about how to mix ingredients for the bombs he was building in his Denver apartment. Zazi was arrested before he could carry out his plan to attack the New York subways. This plot could well have been detected by the NSA's PRISM program, which collects the e-mails and other records of computer users outside the United States from nine U.S. technology companies, including Yahoo. But the detection of the plot does not appear to have anything to do with the government's collection of the phone records of tens of millions of Americans. In the case of Headley, the government hasn't clarified its claim that NSA surveillance led to his detection, but Sebastian Rotella of ProPublica, who has done the most authoritative reporting on the Headley case, says that Headley came to the attention of U.S. officials because he was in contact with al Qaeda operatives in the United Kingdom who were under surveillance by the British. In other words, Headley was not detected by NSA surveillance but because of a tip from a close ally. Moreover, conventional law enforcement methods were available to detect Headley's ties to terrorism, but they were ignored. Headley's wife warned the FBI of his involvement with the Pakistani-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba years before his plot to attack the Danish newspaper.",

A hero tree surgeon has spoken of how he saved a man from being savagely beaten after confronting the thug while dressed as a caveman. Courageous Karl Stephenson, 30, leapt into action wearing his caveman outfit after he saw a helpless victim being battered outside a pub in Stourbridge, West Midlands. CCTV footage which captured the moment made headlines around the world last week after police released it in a bid to trace the attacker. Scroll down for video . Courageous caveman: Karl Stephenson came to the aid of a man who was being savagely beaten on a night out, while wearing this fancy dress costume . And now fearless Karl, who managed to scare the thug away before staying with the 31-year-old injured man until an ambulance arrived, has spoken of the ordeal. Just moments before the attack, the victim was pushed to the ground before the thug rained blows on his face and continued to kick him in the head. Armed with just his inflatable club, Karl, in his Halloween costume, stormed over in disgust as the yob kicked and punched the man unconscious. But modest Karl, of Hagley, West Midlands, today said he was just trying to be a good citizen. He said: 'For some reason my friends went out the front door and I went out the back. That's when I saw the man being kicked. 'There were three men attacking him. I wanted them to stop so I went over and asked them what they were doing. Sickening: The attacker kicks the victim in the head as he lies defenceless on the ground . Vicious: The CCTV footage shows the thug attacking the victim even though he is clearly helpless . 'One of my friends called the police and ambulance to help the injured man. 'It was really horrible. It was one of those moments where I was thinking \"was that real?\" I couldn't believe it had happened.' Karl said the man had been badly injured, but he was glad he was recovering well. Rescued: The attacker stops after Karl, dressed as a caveman, and his acquaintance arrive to pull him off his victim . He said: 'I was just trying to be a good citizen and I hope somebody would so the same for me. 'The first thing I knew about the footage being released was when my sister text me to say she had heard it on the radio. 'I couldn't believe it when I saw the video - it was everywhere. Out of all the things I could be wearing it was a dead caveman costume. 'We had decided to wear fancy dress because it was almost Halloween.' Helping hand: Karl is seen to drop his club as he comes to the aid of the beaten victim . Detective Constable John Horrobin, from West Midlands Police, appealed for any witnesses to the incident on October 27 to come forward . He said: 'In the footage you will see a couple of people in fancy dress costume. 'There had been a fancy dress party at the Mitre Inn on that night and we are appealing to anyone that may have seen the victim on the night to come forward. 'If you saw the assault we would also like to speak to you - ultimately we are hoping that someone will recognise the attacker and will come forward with a name. 'The victim has little recollection of the attack and thankfully he will make a full recovery.' VIDEO: The moment Karl and his friend come to the aid of the helpless victim...",

They work tirelessly to give their patients the best possible care, going far beyond the call of duty with no thought of reward. But last night, five of the NHS’s unsung heroes finally got the recognition they deserve. GP Ronan Moran was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s first Health Hero Awards, in association with Lloydspharmacy and ITV’s This Morning. He and four other heroes met David Cameron at Number 10 before going on to an awards ceremony and dinner hosted by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford at the Marriott Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square. Celebrities including Esther Rantzen took a back seat as they listened to the inspirational stories of the men and women who have gone the extra mile for their patients. All five Health Heroes were nominated by our readers for the prestigious accolade, which aimed to highlight positive and inspiring stories at a time when there are so many reports of neglect and carelessness. Dr Moran, 62, received his nomination from Greta Armitage. Dr Moran, whose practice is in Feltham, West London, cared for her late husband, John, after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In Mr Armitage’s last weeks, Dr Moran would visit the couple at home every day, often late in the evening. Mrs Armitage said: ‘It was because of this really exceptional support [from Dr Moran] that I was able to fulfil John’s ambition which was to die at home.’ When her husband passed away, Mrs Armitage rang the locum doctor on call as it was late at night. Instead, Dr Moran arrived. Mrs Armitage described how his presence was a great comfort to her, and how Dr Moran helped wash her husband and change his clothes and bedding. She said Dr Moran told her he wanted her husband to leave his home with dignity. That level of service, dedication and care was said to be typical of Dr Moran, described by colleagues as an ‘inspiration’. Last night he was presented with the award, and a £5,000 holiday, by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Accepting it, Dr Moran said: ‘I am very humbled. I think it is a great privilege.’ Daily Mail Health Hero Awards finalists from left to right Surgeon David Albert, Dr Ronan Moran, volunteer driver Ron King, charity founder Cathy Ryan and seated Margaret Cameron . His fellow heroes included Margaret Cameron, a nursing assistant for dementia sufferers in Doncaster. She was nominated by Mary Beardsley, a senior nursing sister, for her dedication and compassion. At 69 she still works full-time, helping to run three day care centres for dementia sufferers. Colleagues said her ‘understanding and natural warmth set her apart’ and that patients often ask for her by name when she is not working, despite having severe memory problems. They said she encouraged her patients to engage in therapies thanks to her ‘strength of personality’, and scoured car boot sales looking for objects to help stimulate her patients. GP Ronan Moran was presented with the award by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . David Albert, 57, an ear, nose and . throat surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, was nominated by Cheryl . Towse, from Essex, for his treatment of her son, Theo. She . described how he gave Theo his personal phone numbers, would come in on . his days off to treat him and sing to him when he was  scared. Ron King, 79, a retired bus driver in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, is a volunteer who takes cancer patients to hospital for treatment. He was nominated by Roger Hilliard, whose father has leukaemia. Cathy Ryan, 56, a community matron in Southwold, Suffolk, was nominated by Marian Proctor for her work setting up a charity that has improved the lives of countless carers and their patients, including Marian’s mother. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Awards provide an ideal opportunity to highlight what our National Health Service is about and why we should all be proud of the care it provides. ‘The number of people nominated for the award shows there are unsung heroes dedicated to the task of providing compassionate care in hospitals, surgeries and clinics across the country.’",

        "document": "London, England (CNN) -- Mohamed al Fayed, whose son died in the car crash that killed Princess Diana, has sold the iconic British department store Harrods, the advisers to the sale announced Saturday. Al Fayed, who has been chairman of the store for 25 years, has decided to retire and spend more time with his children and grandchildren, said Ken Costa, chairman of Lazard International. Al Fayed sold Harrods to Qatar Holding, which will become only the fifth owner of the store since it was created in 1849, Costa said. \"In reaching the decision to retire, he wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued, and that the team that he has built up would be encouraged to develop the foundations that he has laid.\" Costa said in a statement. \"Qatar Holding was specifically chosen by the (al Fayed family) as they had both the vision and financial capacity to support the long-term successful growth of Harrods.\" Qatar Holding is a fully owned affiliate of Qatar Petroleum, a state-owned company based in Doha. It was in the mid-1980s that al Fayed bought Harrods, a high-end department store in London's exclusive Knightsbridge neighborhood. In 2005, he unveiled a bronze statue inside the store featuring Princess Diana and his son, Dodi Fayed. Titled \"Innocent Victims,\" the statue was meant to depict the pair in eternal happiness together, al Fayed said at the time. Dodi Fayed and Diana died in 1997 when the car they were riding in crashed in a Paris tunnel as they were pursued by paparazzi. The Sunday Times Rich List two weeks ago put al Fayed's personal fortune at £650 million ($962 million). It said he was only one of three people among the top 100 names on the list to have increased their wealth. \"What recession? Not for Harrods this time,\" al Fayed told the paper. Al Fayed, who is Egyptian, has lived in Britain since the 1970s and regards it as his home, but he has repeatedly been denied a British passport. Harrods was founded by London grocer Charles Henry Harrod, who originally set up shop in east London. Harrod wanted to escape the inner-city filth and capitalize on trade from the upcoming Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, so in 1849 he took over a small shop near the park in what was then the new district of Knightsbridge, on the site of the current store, according to Harrods. It was Harrods that had the very first sale, the Winter Clearance of 1894. They also introduced the world's first escalator in 1898, according to the store -- with brandy at the top for nervous customers. In December 1983, the Irish Republican Army detonated a car bomb near Harrods that killed six people during the Christmas shopping rush. Harrods was starting to find itself outmoded in the 1980s when al Fayed took over, purchasing it as part of the House of Fraser Group for £615 million, the store says. Under al Fayed, Harrods went through a major refurbishment that included constructing the Egyptian Escalator, a $30 million \"homage to ancient Egypt.\"",

        "document": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuters) -- His name is \"Average\" and the story of his desperate flight from the wreckage of President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe is an increasingly common one. Math teacher Mawise Gumba fled Zimbabwe and found his qualifications mean little as a refugee. The tall 34-year-old, slouching exhausted in a Johannesburg church that has become a de facto transit camp, is one man in a tide of migrants washing up in South Africa. \"There is nothing for me there in our country any more. I had no job and I could not afford anything. Even when I was working life was tough,\" he said. \"It's hard for everyone ... I thought it was better for me here,\" said the former store clerk, whose dusty jeans and boots tell of a long and difficult journey. The tale told by Average -- whose name is not unusual in Zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster. When Mugabe's government, facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent, ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- Average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff. Facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country, he joined the estimated 4,000 Zimbabweans who head south to South Africa, most of them illegally, every day. Mugabe, 83 and in power since the country's independence from Britain in 1980, has been accused of running Zimbabwe's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power. His decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world. Average scraped together his last salary, some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked, and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor's visa and bus ticket to Johannesburg. A friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up, leaving him stranded without a place to sleep. On Wednesday evening he walked into the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food. The church's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 Zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries. \"Over the past three years, and more so over the past couple of months, I have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from Zimbabwe,\" Bishop Paul Verryn said. Outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew. Many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats. \"We offer them a place off the streets, where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of Johannesburg,\" Verryn said. At sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets. \"People just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep. Some people sleep on the steps here, in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms,\" said 27-year-old Walter Rusike from Harare. The commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months. Average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend, work or both. \"I have a diploma in stores management and store control, a certificate in security and a driver's licence. I think maybe I will be able to find some work with my qualifications. Anything will be better than the situation I was in,\" he says.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

The San Francisco Chronicle is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term 'Redskins' when it refers to Washington's National Football League team. Managing Editor Audrey Cooper announced on Wednesday that the newspaper's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial slurs. '\"Redskin\" is a patently racist term,' Ms Cole said. Scroll down for video . Name change: The San Francisco Chronicle will now refer to the Red Skins as the Washingtons . The Chronicle joins several other publications that have made the same decision, including the Portland Oregonian, the Kansas City Star and Slate.com. In recent months, local leaders in Washington and some members of Congress have also called for a name change, and some media outlets have stopped using the name. It is also the subject of a long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to void the team's federal trademark protection. Redskins' owner Dan Snyder has said that the original Boston Redskins had a Native American coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to Washington. But Suzan Shown Harjo, a major figure in the trademark case before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was unimpressed with the reference which she described as part of the team's 'time-dishonored history of putting up pseudo-Indians as part of their promotion.' Campaign: The Chronicle is the latest publication to say it will no longer use the term Red Skins . Outdated? Zena \"Chief Z\" Williams, unofficial mascot of the Washington Redskins, signs autographs during fan appreciation day at the Redskins' NFL football training camp at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Virginia in 2012 . Ms Harjo also rebuffed an assertion by Mr Snyder that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage. 'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said in an email to The Associated Press. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.' The debate about whether the term is an epithet has raged for decades. The Chronicle says it revisited the issue last month at the request of Scott Ostler, one of its sports columnists. The paper also recently ran an editorial by Caillie Millner, in which she recalled an encounter two American Indian friends of hers had when they watched the Red Skins play about 40 years ago. Tussle: Fans and campaigners are fighting over claims that the team's name is offensive . The couple 'took their seats, only to be treated like living mascots by Redskins fans. She spoke of being \"poked\" and having their hair \"pawed\" by them, \"in a scary way\",' she wrote in the Chronicle. Ms Millner added: 'When it's all over, we'll look back with amazement at the fact that a team had a name like that in the nation's capital. We'll look back and realize how shameful and embarrassing it really was.' When the San Francisco Chronicle refers to the team, it will now call them the 'Washingtons' Ms Cooper said.",

The parents of a 10-year-old boy who was strip searched by an assistant principal after he was wrongly accused of stealing $20 from a classmate are now suing the school district official over his treatment. Clarinda and Lionel Cox, from Fayetteville, North Carolina, said their son Justin was left traumatised after Teresa Holmes ordered him to remove all of his clothes except for his T-shirt and boxer shorts. The $20 note was later found under a table in the cafeteria of Union Elementary School in Clinton, where Justin was a third-grader at the time. The Cox family has filed an 11-page complaint alleging that the search by Holmes, who has since retired, was a violation of the boy's constitutional protection from unreasonable searches. Upset: Justin Cox, 10, was left traumatized after he was strip-searched when a $20 note when missing at his elementary school, his parents said. They are now suing the school . '[Holmes] ordered J.C. to . remove his shoes, socks, pants, and shirt,' the complaint reads. 'When . J.C. was stripped down to his undershorts and undershirt, [Holmes] put . her fingers inside the waistband of J.C.’s undershorts and ran her . fingers around the waistband. '[Holmes] also lifted J.C.’s undershirt and . searched his bare torso.' When Clarinda Cox later returned home that day, she found . Justin waiting outside for her, which 'was unusual,' the lawsuit said. 'She made me take my clothes off,' the boy told his mother on her arrival. 'Too far': Assistant Principal Teresa Holmes, who has retired, said she was within her rights to search him . John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, a Virginia-based civil liberties organization, told Fox News that the search was a violation of the boy's Fourth Amendment rights, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded school officials did not have the authority to strip-search a 13-year-old girl without evidence the item she held she posed a danger, Whitehead said. 'School officials often don't know the law,' he said. 'There's sort of this mentality that all kids are dangerous today... What you're talking about here was a $20 bill, not a gun or a knife.' He added: 'The boy was traumatized and his parents were traumatized. There is direct Supreme Court precedent and they violated it.' Aspokeswoman for Sampson County Schools referred inquiries to attorney Benjamin Wright, who did not respond to a request for comment. Holmes no longer works at the school and retired in June, shortly after the Cox family stepped forward with their complaints. Justin was searched after he came across money in the cafeteria and gave it back to the student. But the $20 bill went . missing again, and the girl told Holmes and . accused the boy of stealing it, WRAL reported at the time. Holmes then confronted the boy about the theft claim. 'She didn’t ask me if she could, she told me, she said, \"Now I have to strip-search you\",' Justin said. Taking a stand: Clarinda and Lionel Cox, pictured, are now suing the school over searching their son . Anger: The parents, pictured, said the boy was visibly distressed following the incident in June . Holmes took the little boy to the men's room and ordered him to take off his clothes in the presence of a male janitor. The assistant principal did not find the money, Cox said, and hugged Justin and apologized to him afterward. Cox said she was upset that the . school failed to notify her about the incident. When she came home from . work, she learned about the strip-search from Justin, who was visibly . distraught. Sampson . County Schools spokesperson Susan Warren admitted that Cox should have . been informed about the search, but noted that Holmes did nothing wrong. 'The assistant principal was within . her legal authority, her legal right, to do the search,' Warren said in a . statement. 'She may have been overzealous in her actions.' Happier times: Justin seen in this family photo celebrating his tenth birthday . Site: After the strip-search, the $20 note was found under a table in the cafeteria at the school . Ms Cox said that, regardless of the apology, her son was violated. ‘She . came up to him and rubbed her fingers around inside of his underwear,’ she told WRAL. ‘If that isn't excessively intrusive, I don't know what . is.’ Cox said she understands that in . situations involving drugs or weapons, school officials are justified in . conducting a strip-search, but not when it’s about $20. But Holmes offered her side of the . story, saying that Justin was seen diving under the table after the . money, and several students and two teachers saw him pocket the . banknote. She urged him to tell her if he took the money, and in response Holmes said the ten-year-old told her, 'Go ahead and search me.'",

A quarter of television viewers now watch their favourite programmes using catch-up services, it has been revealed, after the recent episode of Sherlock picked up an extra 3.5 million viewers through BBC iPlayer in the days after it was first broadcast. Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time, overtaking the 2011 Downton Abbey Christmas special, which received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. When total viewing figures are analysed, roughly a third of those who watch a programme will now do so through an online catch-up service or or through their television's recording device. Play it again: Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time. One theory on why 'cult' dramas perform so well on catch-up services is because fans re-watch the same episode multiple times . The New Year's Day episode of Sherlock was criticised for failing to answer questions about how the world's most famous detective faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series. But that didn't stop it attracting over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast, raising to 13 million when catch-up services are factored in. The popularity of catch-up services has been attributed to changing lifestyle habits, with people often choosing to use mobile phones or tablets to watch programmes on the move, rather than at home. Now that services such as BBC's iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4's 40D are available as standard on the majority new television sets, the practice of the entire country settling down to watch a programme at the same time is increasingly unrealistic. Top ratings: Downton Abbey's 2011 Christmas special received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. The 2012 version was almost as popular on the catch-up service, bringing in an extra 2.76 million viewers . High ratings: The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million viewers via catch-up, with a further 2.75million watching an episode from February 4 2013 . Many of the programmes with high post-broadcast viewing figures are so-called 'cult' dramas, such as Doctor Who and the aforementioned Sherlock. Although these programmes are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views, it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast, then re-watch one or more times through a catch-up service. Contender: Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer . Speaking to the Telegraph: Charlotte . Moore, the controller of BBC One, said: 'I'm very proud to have Sherlock . on BBC One and see it topping the charts as the biggest consolidated . audience ever. It demonstrates that ambition and quality matter to our . audience.' Of the all time top 10 most watched programmes on a catch-up service, seven are programmes that first appeared on the BBC. Behind Sherlock and Downtown Abbey, the 2012 Call the Midlife Christmas Special is in third place attracting a total of 2.92 additional viewers and 10.1million overall. The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million catch-up viewers, with a further 2.75million . watching an episode from February 4 2013. Although the 2011 episode of Downtown Abbey sits in second place, the 2012 version was almost as popular bringing in 2.76 million catch-up viewers, taking its total to 10.3 million. A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had its viewing figures pushed up from 9.57million to 12.23 million by catch–up. Somewhat less surprising entries were Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special, which attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer - taking the total to 12.8 million, and acclaimed dram Broadchurch, which was watched an additional 2.45million times after first being shown. Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC's director-general has previously stated that he says catch-up services as the future of television and radio. Still attracting fans: A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had total viewing figures of 12.23 million . Speaking about his plans for the BBC late last year, he said: 'No listener or viewer should ever have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn't ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves.' He added: 'The BBC you can have is catching up with the BBC you want; there's a fundamental shift happening.'",

Jackson this week after a snake reportedly bit a Jordanian man who smuggled the reptile onboard. Jackson's character in the movie \"Snakes on a Plane\" tries to figure out how to save the aircraft after crates of hyped-up serpents started killing the cast. There wasn't quite that kind of drama on Monday, but the incident forced the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Egyptian resort town of Al Ghardaqa on the Red Sea, according to The Jordan Times. An Egypt Air official told the paper an investigation revealed that the 48-year-old passenger, who owns a reptile shop in Kuwait, had hidden the Egyptian cobra in a carry-on bag. The passenger was trying to control the snake after it bit his hand and started slithering under the seats. The Egyptian daily al-Masry al-Youm reported that the man refused medical treatment, claiming his wound was only superficial. The plane resumed its flight to Kuwait after local authorities confiscated the snake. Doctors told the passenger he should spend 24 hours in a hospital for observation, but the man refused, the Egyptian Air official said, according to The Jordan Times. Egyptian cobras are commonly found across North Africa. According to wildlife experts, the cobra's venom is so deadly it can kill a full-grown elephant in three hours or a person in about 15 minutes. The venom destroys nerve tissue and causes paralysis and death because of respiratory failure. Legend has it that in ancient times, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra used an Egyptian cobra -- also known as an asp -- to commit suicide.",

A piece of the original World Cup trophy, which was stolen in Brazil in 1983 and never recovered, has been found in a basement at FIFA's headquarters. The base of the Jules Rimet trophy carries the names of the first four World Cup winners between 1930 and 1950. The trophy, which was handed to Brazil permanently after they won the world Cup for the third time in 1970, was also stolen three months before the 1966 World Cup was staged in England. That time, it was recovered a week later after being found in a south London hedge by a dog named Pickles. David Ausseil, the creative director of FIFA's museum which is due to open in March next year, said the trophy had been given a new base in 1954. 'We think no FIFA president has seen it since Jules Rimet himself,' he was quoted as saying by the BBC. The 10 centimetre high octagonal relic will be displayed in the museum. Rimet, the 'father' of the world Cup, was FIFA's president from 1921 to 1954. In the early 1970s, FIFA commissioned a new trophy for the 10th World Cup in West Germany in 1974. Fifty-three designs were submitted to FIFA by experts from seven countries, with the final choice being the work of Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga. Unlike the previous trophy which was awarded to a country winning three world Cups, the current trophy remains in FIFA's possession but a replica is awarded to the three-time winners instead. The current base, made of two layers of semi-precious malachite, bears the engraved year and name of each World Cup winner since 1974.

        "document": "By . Lucy Osborne . PUBLISHED: . 12:39 EST, 29 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:05 EST, 29 December 2013 . When Isobel Wyatt didn't get a coin in exchange for the tooth she left under her pillow, her parents told her it was because the tooth fairy was on strike. The nine-year-old's parents, Wendy Wyatt and Kevin Golding, from Coventry, told her the Government had threatened to take away the fairy's pension, so in protest she refused to go to work. But rather than accept that she would not be visiting, the schoolgirl became so incensed with the government that she decided to write a heartfelt letter to the Prime Minister. Isobel Wyatt, aged nine, is pictured at her home in Coventry, with the letter she received back from David Cameron . Incensed: The youngster sent a hand-written note to 10 Downing Street pleading with Mr Cameron to rethink his stance on the pension issue so the Tooth Fairy could get back to work and take this tooth . In it she pleaded with him to rethink his stance so that the tooth fairy would be happier and could get back to her job. Isobel and her parents didn't think they would hear back from David Cameron but to their amazement, she received a reply this month. An aide thanked her for her query - but confessed the Government was in the dark when it came to plans for a tooth fairy strike. They wrote: 'I was pleased to read your well-written letter and your concerns about the tooth fairy. 'Unfortunately, I am unable to answer your question about possible industrial action.' Primary school pupil Isobel – who lives with her parents, two brothers and sister - said she had been showing off the prized letter to her friends. She said: 'When I got the letter I was stunned. I wrote in because I thought David Cameron would take away the Tooth Fairy's pension. In the post: Isobel did not think she would hear back from the PM after sending this letter . Surprised: Isobel with her mother Wendy Wyatt, aged 39, at her home in Coventry . Downing Street's reply: The letter which Isobel Taylor, nine, received from Prime Minister David Cameron's office . 'I wasn't expecting anything back because he is very busy. I've taken the letter into school to show my friends – they think it's really good.' Her mother, Miss Wyatt a University of Warwick nursery worker, said the 'little white lie' had spiralled. She said: 'Her dad said \"maybe they've gone on strike\".' 'After that she came and spoke to me and I said I thought I'd heard something about David Cameron cutting their pensions. That was when she decided to write the letter.' Isobel had been told that the Government had threatened to take away the fairy's pension, so in protest she refused to go to work . The mother-of-four said Isobel became determined to write after her father, assistant accommodations manager at Warwick University, told her of the tooth fairy strike in October. 'I left her to it and she asked me to get the address, which I did. 'I gave her a stamp and she posted the letter herself back in October and when we didn't hear anything for a while we assumed she'd hear nothing back. 'It wasn't until earlier this month we received a reply and Isobel got very excited when she saw the Downing Street postmark on the back of the envelope. 'She knew what it was straight away. She'd been very upset about the missed visit so she was really pleased to get a response.' Isobel finally received her £2 from her mother after she decided to donate her baby teeth to an art project she saw at a local gallery. Called Palaces, the installation aims to build a 'magical sculpture' out of donated baby teeth from children across the world. Miss Wyatt added: 'Isobel decided she wanted to donate her teeth to the project instead - she's saved a few up. 'We have an arrangement where she donates them and we give her the money instead. 'So she doesn't have to worry about the tooth fairy going on strike anymore.' In 2010, a six-year-old girl sent David Cameron £1 she had received from the tooth fairy because she wanted to 'make the country better and create jobs' after listening to a speech he had made.",

Price: The average cost  of the tests are $20 with prices going up from there . False: Gary Mason, a Kansas police officer, said that if someone used the false test for misrepresentation, that could be a 'level of blackmail' 'For example, if a married man is having an affair and he tried to break it off with the girl, and she became upset and decided to present this fake pregnancy test and demand money, otherwise she would tell the spouse,' Mason said. 'That would be a level of blackmail.' Those who buy the test could face charges including libel, emotional stress, or misrepresentation, according to FOX23.

Sold: Branston Pickle is being bought by Japanese firm Mizkan for £92.5million . It is a key ingredient of such quintessentially British snacks as the ploughman’s lunch and the cheese and pickle sandwich. But after 90 years, Branston Pickle has been sold to a Japanese firm. The £92.5million deal comes just months after the boss of the brand’s parent company, Premier Foods, urged British shoppers to be more patriotic. Branston is the latest in a long line of traditional brands – including Sarson’s vinegar and Weetabix – to be sold abroad. Meanwhile, the makers of HP Sauce, who are running a television campaign highlighting its British roots, are under fire for moving production to Holland. Premier, which acquired Branston in 2002, announced yesterday that it had sold it to Mizkan of Japan. The deal includes the factory that makes Branston in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, along with the 356-strong workforce. Branston is popular beyond Britain, with strong sales in the US, Canada, Australia, Norway, Singapore, Germany and Turkey. Despite this, Mizkan, which has a 200-year history in the Japanese food industry, has no plans to sell the pickle in its home market. 'Buy British': CEO of Premier Foods Michael Clarke has previously urged shoppers to buy products made in this country . Food giant: This shopping basket shows the range of products produced by Premier Foods - including Mr Kipling, Hovis and Bisto . 'Nationalistic': Mr Clarke called for people to 'buy British' to help protect jobs and farmers in this country back in April . Premier, . which owns other well-known British brands including Hovis, Mr Kipling . and Oxo, has been under pressure to raise money and pay off large debts. It sold its Haywards . pickled onions business and Sarson’s and Dufrais vinegar brands to . Mizkan in June. But earlier in the year, Premier boss Michael Clarke . said: ‘We should support British jobs, British supply chains and British . farmers. ‘I’m surprised . [British] people are not as nationalistic as they could be to protect . jobs. If you look at our competitors they ship from overseas. That’s . fine. But I’m going to continue to bang this drum.’ The . company’s director of corporate affairs, Richard Johnson, insisted this . stance was not inconsistent with the decision to sell Branston to a . Japanese firm, adding: ‘Mizkan is a company that wants to invest in the . UK, that will keep production in the UK, and therefore jobs in the UK.’ The . Branston sale goes beyond the popular sweet pickle to include relishes, . tomato ketchup, brown sauce, salad cream, and flavoured ‘mayo with a . twist’. The Suffolk factory . also makes supermarket own-label pickles and sauces. Kazuhide . Matazaemon Nakano , chief executive of Mizkan, said: ‘The Branston brand . is an excellent strategic fit with our global portfolio and adds to our . solid foundation for growth in the UK.’ Premier . had set a target of raising £330million from the sale of brands by the . end of 2014 in order to pay its bank debts, which still remain at a high . £1.27billion. The latest sale means it has met this target ahead of . schedule.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott tells parliament Australian military aircraft will start flying support operations over Iraq from Wednesday . F/A-18F Super Hornet aircrew head to their aircraft in preparation for departure to the Middle East from RAAF Base Amberley last week in Amberley, Australia . 'Ours are support operations, not strike missions. 'Australian air strikes await final clearances from the Iraqi government and a further decision by our own.' He said international security and Australia's national security were 'indivisible'. This comes days after RAAF aircraft conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region. Defence said F/A-18F Super Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A airborne refueler all conducted preliminary flights from Australia's Middle East base on Sunday. That was aimed at familiarising aircrew of the Air Task Group with local conditions and coalition procedures so they can operate in the coalition command and control network. These missions will continue this week. The government  hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said any decision on a combat role should not be rushed. 'We support the government taking the time to get it right,' he said. RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on Islamic State  jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region . He reiterated the four conditions behind the opposition's support for the government on a potential combat role. Labor's support does not extend to ground combat forces and is only confined to Iraq, not Syria. Mr Shorten also welcomed work on the legal and diplomatic framework under way to support Australia's Iraq operations. He offered support to the 600 Australian Defence Force personnel stationed in the Middle East. 'We wish them a safe and successful mission and a speedy return to the ones they love.' All aircraft in the Air Task Group are conducting their first ever combat deployments. The Super Hornets can conduct precision strikes against IS ground units and supply lines in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Wedgetail, regarded as the most advanced aircraft of its type in the world, can coordinate movement of coalition aircraft in what's likely to be very crowded airspace over the battlefield. Australia's tanker aircraft will contribute to the air campaign by refueling coalition aircraft, allowing extended missions. A 200-strong ground force, including special forces, stands ready to advise security forces inside Iraq.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- One of the Web's basic tenets is that small contributions from lots of people can amount to something powerful in the aggregate. Fans of the Japanese band Sour contributed images to a music video. Now, a growing group of writers, musicians, visual artists and videographers is turning this Wikipedia-era philosophy into online collaborative art. Twitter users are banding together to write an opera for London's Royal Opera House. Bands like My Morning Jacket and Sour, out of Japan, are turning to fans to help film their music videos. Programmers are pulling quotes from online social networks to make automated poems. More than 50,000 animators are divvying up work on an upcoming animated film called \"Live Music,\" and amateur videographers are re-filming \"Star Wars\" in 15-second bites. This crowd-sourced creativity online is putting a new twist on traditional ideas of artistic ownership, online communication and art production. \"What's exciting is that it's being tested out by a lot of people who have access to [the technology],\" said Mary Jane Jacob, executive director of exhibitions at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think that we're in a great communal workshop.\" In recent months, the collaborative projects have been showing the professionalism it takes to get noticed amid the clutter of content on the Internet, said Ze Frank, an online personality who orchestrated several early online art projects. Sign up for a CNN art project . Frank said people have been making collaborative online art \"since the beginning of the Web.\" But much of it wasn't worth looking at. Some collaborative books proved to be too much work for even herds of people to tackle. Efforts to create massive drawings with thousands of contributors sometimes ended up looking like random scribbles, for example. But for some reason -- either because people are getting savvier with cameras or because the projects are getting more visibility -- things are starting to click, Frank said. Even if some of the latest collaborative efforts fail to produce masterworks, the real value is the process, he said. \"Even if the [Twitter-written] opera ends up sucking as a performance, the value may have already been played out in the theater of the creation of it,\" he said. Many of the projects aim to hit on universal themes. \"The little elements that aren't synchronized\" in the group art projects remind people that our differences are what make us interesting, said Matt Maloney, associate dean of the school of film and digital media at the Savannah College of Art and Design, referring to this music video, which features fans of the Japanese band Sour. \"The backgrounds change, the people move differently, the quality and temperature of the photography varies from component to component,\" he said. \"If that phenomenon didn't exist, if we were all the same and we were all uniform, this type of collaboration\" would not be powerful. Jacob, of the Art Institute of Chicago, said the projects speak to how people yearn to communicate and to be heard in these hyperconnected, digital times. \"It lets you ... meet other people,\" she said. \"We're not talking eHarmony, but all these things, they're interesting and they are of the moment. When people want to use [communication technologies] in a creative way, that's really exciting.\" The online art collaborations grow out of a parlor-game tradition called \"exquisite corpse,\" she said. Around 1920, famous surrealist artists gathered to draw portraits in pieces. They folded up large sheets of paper so that each artist could see only the edges of what had already been drawn. The pictures made sense only after the paper was unfolded. The online versions of this concept take the idea further because they involve people all over the world who often know nothing of each other, she said. For example, Darren Solomon's site, inbflat.net, features 20 YouTube videos of musicians, many of whom don't know each other, playing various melodies in the key of B flat. Visitors to the site can play the tunes in any order or combination they choose, meaning that each user in a sense becomes part of the artwork, Solomon said. Solomon, who once played bass with Ray Charles and now writes music for TV ads, said the \"In B Flat\" project shows that \"the world can come together and we all speak that [musical] language.\" \"Something about it is very hopeful,\" he said. One key to the project's success, he said, is that it takes relatively little effort for musicians to send in Web-quality videos of themselves playing a short melody in a certain key. \"They're happy to start picking up a video camera and start shooting or they're happy to pick up an instrument and start playing,\" he said. Solomon finds that idea so compelling that he's participated in other projects. With his two sons, ages 7 and 11, he shot three of the 15-second clips of the user-generated \"Star Wars\" that will be stitched together by the site Star Wars Uncut. In one of the videos, he and the boys act out a scene with puppets. In another, his sons wear hooded sweatshirts and fight with light sabers in a New Jersey tunnel. In some cases, people don't even know they're making contributions to online art. Andrei Gheorghe, a Web developer in Romania, created the \"Longest Poem in the World\" by aggregating public Twitter posts and arranging them in rhyming couplets. Computers add 10 to 20 lines to the poem each minute, he said. Gheorghe said he doesn't consider his work art. \"It was just a random idea that popped up and I played with it. And it is what it is,\" he said. Art professors said deciding what is and isn't art is a complicated process. In some ways, these collaborative projects are fine art, they said. In other ways they're like games or means of communication. Like all good art, these projects are trying to \"stand convention on its ear,\" said Maloney, from the Savannah College of Art and Design. \"That's going to keep happening,\" he said. \"So as soon as we finally nail this down you'll have another group of talented artists that are going to say, 'Well, I'm going to do something completely different.'\"",

        "document": "(CNN)The late Saudi monarch King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud assumed the throne in 2005, but had effectively been running the kingdom since his half-brother King Fahd's stroke a decade earlier. His two decades at the helm of one of the West's key strategic allies in the Muslim world left an indelible, if ambiguous, legacy. Here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign. Hopes were high that Abdullah's reputation as a modernizing reformer would translate into gains for women in the ultraconservative kingdom. But in the face of deep-seated cultural opposition to change, the progress was less than expected, said CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson. \"He promised a lot of reforms but ... he was limited by the conservative nature of Saudi society.\" Abdullah was the first Saudi monarch to appoint women to government positions. In 2013, he appointed 30 women to the 150-member Shura Council, the top consultative body that plays an advisory role within Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy. This year, women will be able to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections for the first time, and women have been elected to boards of chambers of commerce. But many other restrictions on Saudi women remain: Women cannot marry, leave the country, go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian, usually their father or husband. Saudi Arabia remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive, despite petitions and civil disobedience campaigns by activists in recent years. In November, the Shura Council recommended that the ban be lifted, with restrictions, but the recommendation has not been acted on, and those who defy the ban continue to be prosecuted. Robert W. Jordan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia form 2001 to 2003, said he had frequent conversations with Abdullah about human rights, including the rights of women in the kingdom. \"He said, 'Don't push us to breaking point',\" Jordan told CNN. \"It's a halting kind of process of reform, one that requires this kind of juggling.\" Ali al-Ahmed, a former Saudi political prisoner and the director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, said Abdullah's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was unwarranted. The kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments, including executions and floggings. \"Reforms in Saudi Arabia do not exist. This is an absolute monarchy, let's be honest,\" he said. READ MORE: Saudi Arabia's 'reformer' King Abdullah dies . The September 11, 2001 attacks on Saudi Arabia's key ally -- in which 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudi -- were an inflection point for the kingdom. Abdullah lobbied for the removal of U.S. troops who had been stationed in the country since 1990 --- a prime grievance for the September 11 attackers -- then set about bolstering its military with a $150 billion spend. Attacks on residential compounds housing many Westerners -- in which dozens were killed -- led to a harsh crackdown on terrorist elements within the kingdom seeking to topple the House of Saud. Leaders were captured, followers driven underground and radical preachers sidelined, said Robertson. Saudi Arabia has taken a lead role in the U.S.-led international coalition fighting the radical Sunni terror group ISIS -- which now rivals Al Qaeda as the world's most prolific jihadist group -- in Syria and Iraq. But questions remain about the links between Saudi Arabia and Islamist terror. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in October, billionaire Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal acknowledged that \"unfortunately some extremists in Saudi Arabia ... did fund certain extremist elements in Syria,\" but insisted that the support had been stopped. Others argue that Wahhabism, the puritan form of Sunni Islam that is the kingdom's official religion, promoted throughout the Muslim world, provides the ideological breeding ground for such groups. Saudi Arabia now faces a threat from ISIS on its on border. Earlier this month, ISIS allegedly attacked a Saudi border patrol near Arar. The kingdom is building a massive fence along its border with Iraq in order to keep the militants out, said Robertson. READ MORE: Amid turmoil, King Abdullah brought stability, pushed reforms . One of Abdullah's greatest legacies has been his focus on modernizing the Saudi education system, said Mark Weston, author of \"Prophets and Princes: Saudi Arabia from Muhammad to the Present.\" Following a failed attempt in 1979 by extremist insurgents to capture Mecca's Grand Mosque and topple the Saudi leadership, the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative, said Robertson. This renewed puritanism was reflected in the education system for two decades, until Abdullah began an ambitious program of modernization, despite opposition from religious conservatives. The centerpiece is the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, which has sent hundreds of thousands of young Saudis abroad to study at the government's expense. The aim is to develop a workforce of Saudi nationals capable of replacing expatriate workers in higher-skilled jobs in the kingdom, but also to bring a more modern, international outlook to the kingdom. \"Giving these scholarships recognizes that the road of modernizing Saudi Arabia comes from education,\" said Robertson. At home, the country's first coeducational campus, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, was founded amid some objections in 2009. In expressing his condolences, U.S. President Barack Obama credited Abdullah for his commitment to the education of his country. READ MORE: Who is Saudi Arabia's new King Salman? While Abdullah's legacy as a social reformer is up for debate, his achievements at economic reform are more clear-cut, say observers. Besides his educational reform, the late king's other lasting achievement was joining the World Trade Organization in 2005, integrating his country into the global economy, said Weston. Abdullah opened his country up for foreign direct investment and committed huge sums of the country's oil wealth on infrastructure and mega-projects such as the $86 billion King Abdullah Economic City, announced in 2005. The reforms reflected Abdullah's recognition of the need to diversify the country's economy ahead of the inevitable day the oil money ran out, said Robertson. READ MORE: Thousands to farewell King Abdullah . Saudi Arabia also lifted its international profile under Abdullah's rule, with the late king taking a strong role in regional and world affairs. Obama, in expressing his condolences, praised the monarch for his \"bold steps\" in advancing Middle East peace initiatives, and for greater outreach to the international community. During his reign, Saudi Arabia became the only Arab nation with a seat at the G20, and the first Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, as the Saudi monarchs are known, to meet the Pope. Abdullah espoused a message of religious tolerance, despite the strictures of Saudi Wahhabism, said Robertson. CNN's Nic Robertson, Becky Anderson and Christiane Amanpour contributed to this report.",

        "document": "(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic is into the quarterfinals of the Western and Southern Open after beating the Czech Republic's Radek Stepanek 6-3 6-3 in Cincinnati. Djokovic, 24, had his serve broken on three occasions by Stepanek, ranked 29 in the world, but recovered to seal victory with his first match point at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. \"There are periods of the match where I serve okay and then periods where I serve very bad, but that's okay,\" the Serb, who has now won 55 matches this season, told the ATP Tour's web site. \"It all happens. I played so many matches, and they caught up to me a little bit. It's expected that some part of my game is not working 100 per cent.\" Can anybody stop Novak and Serena? The three-time grand slam winner will face French number one Gael Monfils in the last eight, after the 24-year-old defeated Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-2 6-2. Rafael Nadal, the man Djokovic replaced as world number one, emerged victorious from a marathon encounter with his compatriot Fernando Verdasco. Nadal, a 10-time major winner, eventually sealed his 12th career success against Verdasco 7-6 (7-5) 6-7(7-4) 7-6(11-9) in three hours and 38 minutes. \"You enjoy always a good match,\" reflected Verdasco, who forced Nadal to five match points. \"But when you lose in this way, of course it's not easy, because it could have been a big win.\" American number one Mardy Fish will be Nadal's opponent in the next round; after the seventh seed registered a 7-5 7-5 win over French 12th seed Richard Gasquet. Roger Federer, who beat Fish in last year's final, continued his quest for a record fifth Western and Southern Open crown with a 6-4 6-1 triumph over wildcard James Blake. \"Against James it's always a fast paced match from start to finish,\" 16-time major champion Federer said. \"You hope you get on a roll and he doesn't. \"I was able to counter his attacking style. I was able to play clean on my service games.

The Lima talks are trying to work out draft elements of a . deal for Paris next year, but face numerous fault lines about . what should be included. Average global temperatures for 2014 have been higher than average and may even break previous records . Heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades, according to scientists. Researchers at the University of East Anglia found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average. It comes as meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record. Figures published by the Met Office predicted that the global mean temperature for 2014 is 0.01°C warmer than 2010, currently the warmest on record at 14.50°C (58.12°F) This is despite much of the northern hemisphere being plunged into temperatures well below freezing in January as North America was hit by an Arctic polar vortex. According to the latest findings from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere. Professor Scott Robeson, from Indiana University, who also took part in the study, said: 'Arguably, these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society.' He added that the study could help to explain the 'pause' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year. Many developing nations, for instance, want a target of . cutting world greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050. Opec nations, worried about loss of income from a shift to . renewable energy, favour much vaguer long-term goals. A recent IPCC report found that global warming is already here, man-made and increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible. Global warming, it says, is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans,' and further pollution from heat-trapping gases will raise the likelihood of severe impacts for mankind. The report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it's likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer.

'We want to look forward with optimism but we cannot be happy with the way we played at the World Cup.'

Goal: Kroos, 89. Referee: Stefan Johannesson (Stockolm) Spain started with just four of the players that helped them win the World Cup four years ago and Germany fielded only three of their starters from the victory over Argentina in the Maracana in July. The host's first real chance came on 11 minutes when Celta Vigo forward Nolito almost scored on his debut in his home stadium. He let-fly from distance only for former Northampton Town keeper Ron-Robert Zieler to turn the shot around the post. The Hannover 96 goalkeeper had gone on loan at Northampton and played two games for the Cobblers in the 2008-09 season. Spain were playing the better football with Isco pulling the strings against Real Madrid team-mates Kroos and Sami Khedira. With three Real Madrid midfielders on the pitch and the driving rain making for rapidly deteriorating playing conditions coach Carlo Ancelotti will have had a nervous eye on the match having lost Luka Modric for three months when he injured a tendon in his thigh against Italy at the weekend. When the injury scare came it was for Germany manager Joachim Löw and for Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola as Thomas Müller was taken off after 23 minutes with a bruised back. His last contribution was to play a part in the best move of the first half. It was the first glimpse of the kind of football that wins World Cups from Germany as Kroos, Muller and Mario Gotze combined brilliantly. Iker Casillas – playing his 160th game for Spain – got down well to make the save. Del Bosque took off three of his World Cup winners at half time with Sergio Ramos, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique all replaced and then brought on Kiko Casilla in goal for the last 15 minutes. His brief debut turned sour as Kroos showed his class with two minutes left scoring from distance to give Germany the win.

        "document": "(CNN) -- The \"mommy war\" between stay-at-home and working mothers is in danger of being overshadowed by another maddening contest: the one between mothers in the U.S. and France. Two recent books, Pamela Druckerman's \"Bringing Up Bébé\" and Karen Le Billon's \"French Kids Eat Everything,\" make the case that French parents raise kids who behave and eat far better than their American counterparts. This month, the English language debut of the European bestseller by French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter, \"The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women,\" is already causing a stir. Badinter argues that overwhelming numbers of French mamans manage to work full-time and have several kids because they haven't succumbed to intensive ideals of motherhood, most of all American-style \"natural mothering.\"  Think extended breastfeeding, nonmedicalized birth, co-sleeping, and cloth diapers. Commentators are already jumping on Badinter's polemic as mommy war fodder.  Does La Leche League oppress women?  Is the environmental movement, or feminism, to blame? It's been a busy season indeed for chroniclers of the faux mommy wars.  But as usual, that war is more farce than reality.  Fini, everyone. The global battle between mamans and mamas, just as the one between stay-at-home and working moms, is largely staged.  The sometimes jazzy headlines -- such as \"The conflict attacks progressive parenting as anti-feminist\" on April 10 in The Washington Post -- do a disservice to the complex lives of women. Creating two categories of mothers pits one against the other, and obscures the way traditional mommy-dividing categories often overlap. Women frequently opt in and out and back from paid work. Conversations about that fabricated domestic war and the latest international one obscure real differences linked to factors such as class and education.  And of course, \"French\" and \"American\" simplify the lives of millions of mothers in both countries. If, instead, we actually read these books, we would realize that these authors are trying to offer solutions to the same problems in different ways.  We admit it's hardly as sexy as the Hilary Rosen-Ann Romney showdown, whereby stay-at-home motherhood became partisan fodder after the Democratic strategist Rosen criticized Mitt Romney for turning to his wife, who has \"never worked a day in her life,\" for counsel on the economic issues working mothers face.  But we ought to slow down long enough to hear what these authors say before pulling our guns.  There are kernels of wisdom here. Badinter, for example, wants all women (and particularly those who are French) to resist ideals of mothering that view women as the primary, more \"natural\" caregiver, which can make it all the more difficult to balance motherhood with work and a full, adult life. We applaud the way she asks us to examine these intensive ideals of motherhood and their reach. No woman should feel shame because she fails to breastfeed or give birth without an epidural.  More fundamentally, we agree that care-giving shouldn't be the province of women alone. We disagree with Badinter, however, that the obstacles are merely in our heads.  We think they're in political structures, too.  Despite Badinter dismissing as irrelevant the French policies that make health care and day care accessible and affordable, here in the U.S., we lack such support for parents, mothers in particular, who work and do the second shift at home. The battle for pumHping stations and flextime seems a worthier cause than the trumped-up war between those who breastfeed and those who don't.  Surely natural mothering practices would not be so oppressive and disadvantageous to women if we set up society to accommodate them. And while we're on it, the focus on breasts is a diversion.  As a mother said in an interview when Badinter's book came out in France, the real conflict is not between the mother and the woman,  but the woman and the company.  When Badinter rejects breastfeeding so mothers can retain their sexuality, one could argue she is merely replacing the tyranny  of \"breasts for bébé\" for the tyranny of \"breasts for men.\" Still, Badinter has good points, and we shouldn't be so offended as to let the criticism of our parenting overshadow the reality that we, in the United States, have a long way to go.  Perhaps there is something to American mothers' nostalgia for the French way of life, like authors Judith Warner, Jennifer Conlin, Le Billon and Druckerman, all who have raised children in France. You don't have to be an anthropologist to know that other cultural perspectives can shed light on how we've constructed particular ideals of motherhood and family, how our government and workplaces value -- or don't value -- motherhood. Perhaps the French experience might be a reminder that, with a revolution, structures can, and do, change. The solution to the challenges of American parenting is hardly as simple as making children eat spinach, or privileging disposable diapers over cloth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.",
